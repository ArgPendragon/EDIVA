README: Novel & Database Index Structure
This system indexes a structured dataset containing a novel and a database of entities (characters, locations, concepts, factions, etc.). The indexer produces two files:

indexdiva.json - The full (detailed) index of all entries.
metadiva.json - A slimmed-down structured map for faster querying and relationship analysis.
File Breakdown
1. indexdiva.json (Full Index)
ðŸ“Œ Purpose:
This file contains all the indexed data in full detail, including:

Novel Scenes (full text, summaries, structure, keywords)
Database Entries (characters, locations, events, etc., with full descriptions)
Notes (unofficial database elements)
Keyword Groups (linking keywords to the scenes where they appear)

    }
  ],
  "notes": [...],
  "keyword_groups": { "Krug": ["Scene 1", "Scene 2"] }
}
2. metadiva.json (Slim Structured Map)
ðŸ“Œ Purpose:
This file is a compact version optimized for navigation, relationship search, and efficient AI querying.

ðŸ“Œ Key Changes in the Slim Map:

Novel Structure is Hierarchical (act â†’ chapter â†’ scenes).
Database Entries Use Compact Labels:
t â†’ title
ty â†’ type (e.g., "Character", "Location")
id â†’ unique identifier
c â†’ connections (resolved relationships to other entries)
How to Use the Index
âœ… For Full Data (Full Text, Rich Details): Use indexdiva.json.
âœ… For Fast Queries (Structure, Relationships, Lookups): Use metadiva.json.

Searching for a Scene
To find a scene by title, look inside:

indexdiva.json â†’ novel (for full text)
metadiva.json â†’ novel (for a structured view)
Searching for a Database Entry
Check metadiva.json â†’ database for a compact overview of an entity and its relationships.
If full content is needed, find the same entity in indexdiva.json â†’ entries.
Finding Related Entries
Use connections (c) in metadiva.json to find related database entries.
Example:
"Battaglia di Roma" is connected to "Assedio di Milano", so you can follow id: "2lF0JpnxOTbIfFZ8uGlAqAMrUWu".
