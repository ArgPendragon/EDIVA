      "title": "Wal Thornhill: Interdisciplinary Story of the EU | Thunderbolts",
      "description": "At the 20th Annual Conference of the Natural Philosophy Alliance (NPA20), held July 2013 in College Park, Maryland USA, Australian physicist Wal Thornhill recounted his personal odyssey, starting with inspiration from Immanuel Velikovsky and culminating in an interdisciplinary perspective on the grand view of the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology.\n\nOne of the highlights at NPA20 was the presentation of the distinguished Sagnac Award to Wal Thornhill for his lifelong contribution to science.\n\nWal Thornhill (1942–2023) was the co-founder of The Thunderbolts Project and its Chief Science Advisor. His philosophical approach is that we must first understand human nature to understand the cosmos. The Electric Universe Model is the only science that has grown from diverse disciplines of understanding, offering hope and inspiration for a better future. \n----\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.

      "description": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) still continues to reveal celestial objects whose apparent age, size, complexity and chemical composition is totally incompatible with the conjectured conditions in the so-called early Universe.\n\nJWST recently discovered Zhúlóng, a grand-design spiral galaxy at the tail-end of the cosmic dawn—12.8 billion years ago. Supposedly, this mature galaxy formed much earlier than expected—only one billion years after the Big Bang.\n\nThree tenets of the Standard Model of Cosmology to ponder...\n\n1) The Big Bang is when the Universe began as an intense burst of energy 13.8 billion years ago\n\n2) A massive dark matter structure is necessary to host early large-scale spiral galaxies such as Zhúlóng\n\n3) Sizable dark matter structures don't have enough time to form a billion years after the Big Bang \n\nInstitutionalized Astrophysicists play dark matter games, adding yet more epicycles to the Big Bang story, including the proposed doubling of the age of the Universe to 26 billion years old.\n\nIndependent researcher Stuart Talbott illustrates how in lieu of overwhelming evidence expert investigators keep coming up empty handed while the number of professional scientists who are eager to abandon this fruitless chase continue to grow.\n\n----\nJanuary 17, 2025\nLyrics by Stuart Talbott.

      "description": "Venus used to be known as Earth's twin. It was believed Venus would be covered with oceans and lush vegetation—after all Earth and Venus are a similar size and distance from the Sun. \n\nHowever in 1950, Immanuel Velikovsky (1895–1979) published “Worlds in Collision”. He proposed that Venus entered the inner solar system as a cometary body—appearing as a terrifying Specter in the Sky to our prehistoric ancestors. He also predicted space probes would find a hellish landscape on Venus—with extraordinarily hot, nearly incandescent surface temperatures. The Venera and Mariner missions to Venus proved these predictions correct by the late 1960s. \n\nIn December 2024, a University of Cambridge paper details how the volcanic resupply to Venus’s atmosphere indicates that the planet has never been liquid-water habitable. In fact, it suggests Venus has always been drier than a bone.\n\nIndependent researcher Stuart Talbott juxtaposes mythological tales with scientific facts to present a comprehensive review of Venus and its place within our solar system.\n\n---\nDecember 2, 2024\nNature Astronomy - Open Access\n\"A dry Venusian interior constrained by atmospheric chemistry\"\n– Tereza Constantinou, Oliver Shorttle, Paul B.

      "title": "Thornhill's POV: Gravitational Waves | Thunderbolts",
      "description": "A reading of the article “Gravitational Waves” by Wal Thornhill. Narrated by David Harrison, proprietor of Stickman On Stone.\n\nThe headline shrieked, “Gravitational waves have been discovered; Einstein proved right again after 100 years.” This milestone from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) was announced in February 2016. Two weeks later, Wal posted his critical analysis.\n\nSome incredibly detailed claims were made; the signal originated in the last fraction of a second before the fusion of two black holes somewhere in the southern sky, it was based on computer modeling that these black holes had joined 1.3 billion years ago, and they had a combined mass 29-to-36 times greater than the Sun.\n\nA mathematical computer model is not real evidence for those claims. The public is being baffled by punctilious abstractions. This isn’t science.\n\nBlack holes are a flawed theoretical concept used to make the minuscule force of gravity responsible for the most energetic compact bursts of energy in the universe. However, what can succeed without stretching either space-time or credulity, is the most concentrated form of stored electromagnetic energy known to science—a plasmoid.\n\nIn summary, the results of the LIGO experiment have nothing to do with imagined Gravitational Waves.\n\nSOURCE ARTICLE\nHoloscience: EU Views - February 25, 2016\nhttps://www.holoscience.com/wp/gravitational-waves/\n\n----\nIdeas and/or concepts presented in this program do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe model or the views of The Thunderbolts Project or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

      "title": "Peter Mungo Jupp: Greenland the Viking Paradise | Thunderbolts",
      "description": "During the years 800 to 1,200 AD, Greenland and Iceland were settled by the Vikings. This occurred about the same time as the Medieval Warm Period, which allowed this great migration to flourish.\n\nGreenland was settled when Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for manslaughter after a series of violent conflicts with his neighbors. He converted his misfortune into the foundation of a new colony.\n\nThe initial settlement was on a deep fiord on the south-western coast, next to today’s arctic Canada. Conditions were similar to Iceland, which was itself enjoying a warm temperate climate at that time. Chroniclers even mention swimming in Greenland’s Fjords! Today, totally impossible.\n\nArchaeologist and Thunderbolts colleague Peter Mungo Jupp describes the evidence with his reasoning on how cosmic rays, comets, and our Sun have electromagnetic effects on weather, life, and the geology of the Earth.\n\nSOURCE ARTICLE\nPeter Mungo Jupp: Greenland: Once a Viking Paradise | TPOD\nhttps://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/2024/02/05/greenland-once-a-viking-paradise-2/\n\n----\nIdeas and/or concepts presented in this program do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe model or the views of The Thunderbolts Project or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

      "title": "Misconception #5: What About Gravity? | Thunderbolts",
      "description": "Narrated by David Drew. Fifth episode in the Misconception series on the EU Model—with a focus on gravitational theory.\n\nHypothesized collisions, explosions, and slow accretion processes don't match the observations—and do not work experimentally. Decades of planetary simulations show gravitational accretion achieves an object the size of a pebble.\n\nThe common demonstration of space-time curvature—placing a large ball on a rubber sheet (the Sun), with smaller balls (planets) attracted to it—essentially uses gravity to explain gravity. This circular reasoning persists largely unchallenged.\n\nSir Oliver Lodge said “...if a special geometry has to be invented to account for a falling apple, even Newton might be appalled at the complications which would ensue when really difficult problems are tackled.” An accurate description of the struggle to understand gravity’s true nature without resorting to abstract geometries.\n\nIf gravity functions as an electric dipole force between subatomic particles, as Wal Thornhill has proposed, then it 'daisy chains' through matter, irrespective of conductivity. This explains why gravity doesn’t interfere with essential electrons.\n\nAuthor and independent researcher David Drew sums it up—the science isn’t settled. When it comes to gravity we need to stay grounded.\n\nMay 11, 2024\nMisconception #1: Where's the Problem? | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/I7mHSEzDs08\n\nJune 21, 2024\nMisconception #2: Where's the Science? | Thunderbolt\nhttps://youtu.be/JK90x5j-ykA\n\nAugust 24, 2024\nMisconception #3: Where's the Math? | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/a8Rhx4VRKAo\n\nOctober 5, 2024\nMisconception #4: Where's the Peer Review? | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/45PRP6HN2Io\n\nNovember 24, 2024\nMisconception #5: What About Gravity? | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/\n\nDavid Drew aka The Soupdragon\nhttps://www.plasmacosmology.net/\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

Its compactness is due to the electromagnetic pinch effect where it enters Saturn's atmosphere.\n\nThe hot-spot's behavior should be variable like that on Venus and correlated with the appearance of Saturn's ring spokes, which are visible manifestations of a heightened equatorial discharge in that part of Saturn's Faraday motor circuit. \n\nThe Electric Universe also predicts, experimentum crucis, that BOTH poles should be hot, not one hot and the other cold. As you can imagine, verification of any of these predictions should serve notice that plasma cosmology and the electric model of stars is the cosmology of the future.”\n\nAuthor, EU advocate and narrator Matt Finn, explains how it's the electric force we're seeing at work on Saturn—and the further out we look, the more obvious it becomes we are witnessing evidence of an Electric Universe.\n\n----\n\nSOURCE MATERIAL\n\nTPOD: Saturn’s Monstrous Polar Storm\nhttps://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2007/arch07/070517polarstorm.htm\n\nTPOD: Saturn's Dragon Storm\nhttps://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2006/arch06/060714dragonstorm.htm\n\nTPOD: Electric Lights on Saturn\nhttps://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2005/arch05/050815northlight.htm\n\nEU VIEWS: The ‘Spiral Galaxy’ at Saturn’s Pole\nhttps://www.holoscience.com/wp/the-spiral-galaxy-at-saturns-pole/\n\nAvailable now—Matt Finn's “Breath of Life”— his first installment in The Aquarium Cycle, an enhanced sci-fi adventure.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGC9R34T\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

      "title": "Thornhill's POV: Science Heading for a BIG BANG | Thunderbolts",
      "description": "A reading of the article “Science Heading for a BIG BANG” by Wal Thornhill. Narrated by David Harrison, proprietor of Stickman On Stone. \n\nForget the glossy astronomy books and magazines—the Big Bang is pure fiction. The discoveries that prove it will also bring about the end of science-as-we-know-it.\n\nOf course, many books and articles have been published heralding the end of science—meaning there is little left to learn. The truth is the opposite. Much of what we think we know “ain’t so”. As always, unlearning it will give us more trouble than learning something new.\n\nThe belief of scientists in their cleverly concocted creation story, the Big Bang, has become so entrenched and over-hyped that it is difficult to imagine an effective face-saving strategy when the news leaks out that it is nonsense. And let there be no doubt about it, the hard science to prove the case against the Big Bang has been done by an astronomer who is uniquely well placed for the task.\n\nHis name is Halton Arp, and he is best known for his classic work \"The Arp Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies\".\n\nWhen he began to announce findings nearly thirty years ago that contradicted orthodox cosmology he was refused telescope time and publication in the standard journals. In frustration he published two books. The first in 1987 titled \"Quasars, Redshifts and Controversies\". Then in 1998, \"Seeing Red: Redshifts, Cosmology and Academic Science\".\n\n“Redshift” is the term used to describe the shift in frequency of spectral lines toward the red end of the spectrum. It is known to occur when an object is speeding away from us. \n\nRead the source article here...\n\nHoloscience: EU Views - April 27, 2000\nhttps://www.holoscience.com/wp/science-heading-for-a-big-bang/\n\nTHOTH, VOL IV, No 8 - April 30, 2000\nhttps://saturniancosmology.org/othergroup/thoth/thotiv08.txt\n\n----\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented in this program do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe model or the views of The Thunderbolts Project or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

      "description": "Between Bali and its neighboring Indonesian island, Lombok, lies a slim ten-mile sea channel—the start of the thousands-mile-long Wallace Line—a geological etching beneath the sea, and also a distinct biological division.\n\nOn one side are bouncing kangaroos—on the other side are man-eating tigers. To the south is Australia—to the north are the Philippines. The boundary is marked by steep underwater sharp-faced cliffs.\n\nWhat if an electrical charge machined along the borders of this Wallace Line? Could the resulting electric discharges have affected the chromosomes of life forms? The answer may be an electromagnetic arc that stimulated an adaptive species readjustment called polyploidy. \n\nArchaeologist and Thunderbolts colleague Peter Mungo Jupp shares his hypothesis of a major cosmic plasma discharge event that caused polyploidy to form new species—and the effect was instant speciation in Australasia.\n\nSOURCE ARTICLE\nPeter Mungo Jupp: Can Kangaroos Swim?

Electro-tropism is why branches and woody plants in close proximity grow away from each other.\n\nCommon plant directional tropisms are Chemotropism, Gravitropism, Hydro- tropism, Heliotropism, Phototropism, Thermotropism, and Thigmotropism—although none consider electric force vectors.\n\nVoltage recordings done on a variety of trees and plants demonstrate large numbers of electrons continuously flowing towards branch tips, with or without leaves. Woody tree parts are a physical record of electrical flow, just like a Lichtenberg Figure is a physical record of electrical flow.\n\nArthur Ramthun, P.E., is a civil engineer who has taken it upon himself to explore, experiment and develop a new base of knowledge on Plant Electro-tropism.

      "description": "An idea developed by Göran Marklund in 1979 is that electric current flow through space will naturally cause a segregation of elements and compounds. It is called Marklund Convection.\n\nA recent study provides a solid argument for the role of electricity in the gestation of solar systems.\n\nWe know that when electric currents flow through space, there will be a natural segregation of elements. Heavier elements such as Iron will migrate to the center; lighter elements like Hydrogen will migrate to the outside—and they will form layers.\n\nThis is what is observed and documented in the paper \"The nested morphology of disk winds from young stars revealed by JWST/NIRSpec observations\" by Pascucci et al., and published in Nature Astronomy on October 4, 2024.\n\nAlthough, the authors do not advocate an Electric model of solar formation—but a gravity model with magnetic fields as a consequence of gravity. Does the gravity model predict the observed segregation? It does not.\n\nAstrophysicist Michael Clarage, PhD, is weary from hearing the experts tell Nature what she can and cannot do.\n----\n\nMichael Clarage\n\"The Gestation of Solar Systems\"\nhttps://michaelclarage.substack.com/p/the-gestation-of-solar-systems\n\nPHYS.ORG\n\"Winds of change: Webb reveals forces that shape protoplanetary disks\"\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-10-webb-reveals-protoplanetary-disks.html\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

Fourth episode in the Misconception series on the EU Model—with a focus on how the peer review system generally escapes scrutiny and why it's portrayed as an infallible tool for scientific integrity—which is exasperating on several levels.\n\nFirst, senior academics and scientists who review scientific papers are typically well-established in their field—which is essential for evaluation—but can lead to accusations of bias and/or cognitive dissonance.\n\nSecond, peer review \"referees\" are anonymous—protection from external influence, which is good—but favored theories are touted while maverick ideas are easily dissented without consequence.\n\nThird, a peer-reviewed paper signifies it's been scrutinized and passed muster as acceptable science, but if conflicting conclusions arise from other peer-reviewed work—it is often willfully ignored. \n\nAuthor and independent researcher David Drew analyzes the role of peer review and wonders how can we trust peer-reviewed science when, all too often, it follows the money.\n---\n\nMay 11, 2024\nMisconception #1: Where's the Problem? | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/I7mHSEzDs08\n\nJune 21, 2024\nMisconception #2: Where's the Science? | Thunderbolt\nhttps://youtu.be/JK90x5j-ykA\n\nAugust 24, 2024\nMisconception #3: Where's the Math? | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/a8Rhx4VRKAo\n\nOctober 5, 2024\nMisconception #4: Where's the Peer Review? | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/45PRP6HN2Io\n\nNovember 24, 2024\nMisconception #5: What About Gravity? | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/Svro-PWIkao\n\nDavid Drew aka The Soupdragon\nhttps://www.plasmacosmology.net/\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

      "description": "They call Mars \"Scar Face\". His weapon, the Thunderbolt. In other words, the electrical circuit equivalent of an X-class flare on the Sun is what happened to Mars.\n\nMars looks like it was hit by an enormous Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) which struck the North Pole, spreading surface charge across the planet—stripping away the original atmosphere and leaving a dense plasma of charged dust particles and gases.\n\nThis charged layer of soil was immediately sputtered by the coulomb force between the crustal surface and the electrified atmosphere—virtually lifted off the Martian landscape into plasma winds which deposited the dust surrounding the oppositely charged South Pole. This is why Mars—like the Moon—has regolith piled on one hemisphere and not the other.\n\nAuthor and engineer Andrew Hall empirically demonstrates Mars is a blown spherical capacitor.\n----\n\nADDITIONAL RESEARCH...\nOn plasma discharge patterns and Valles Marineris in the lab.\n\nAndrew Hall\n\"Granite Cauldron and the Boiling Boulders\"\nThunderbolts – June 10, 2023\nhttps://youtu.be/zGfm8D7USmg\n\nAndrew Hall\n\"The Keystone Pattern\"\nThunderbolts – April 16, 2022\nhttps://youtu.be/HdfBGqWpW5w\n\nAndrew Hall\n\"The Cross from Laramie\"\nThunderbolts – May 29, 2021\nhttps://youtu.be/77MErWVp3wg\n\nMichael Steinbacher & Billy Yelverton\n\"Valles Marineris in the Laboratory?\"\nSpace News – May 9, 2015\nhttps://youtu.be/dSRLb85UAEA\n\n----\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

Even more confusing is that these craters are at a perfect 90º angle—as if an electric arc had run across the surface.\n\nThe EU Model elucidates that the scars observed on Asteroids are from electric arcs which cut surface depressions, scoop out material, accelerate it into space—then leave behind clean-cut geological relief.\n\nThe effect is circular craters, while the cause is electric. We know that because we use electric arcs to do this every day in common Electric Discharge Machining (EDM).\n\nUnlike mathematical nonsense the experts pretend is real, EDM is direct evidence proven to work. The electrical machining effect they produce is scaleable—probably infinitely scaleable.\n\nAuthor, EU advocate and narrator Matt Finn, explains how and why the electric force disputes the impact theory of crater formation on Asteroids.\n\n----\n\nSOURCE MATERIAL\nTPOD: Asteroids That Should Not Be\nhttps://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2005/arch05/050714asteroids.htm\n\nAvailable now—Matt Finn's “Breath of Life”— his first installment in The Aquarium Cycle, an enhanced sci-fi adventure.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGC9R34T\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

For example, planetary orbits were believed to be perfectly circular. When proven false, a mathematical workaround was devised—epicycles. Although mathematically elegant, the epicyclic model failed to reflect reality.\n\nMathematics can describe nature with precision—it's known as the language of the universe—although how it's interpreted can be subjective and even lost in translation.

      "description": "The mystery of ancient megaliths stirs wonder in the curious mind. They are artifacts from our deepest past, yet endured millennia with more grace and stamina than anything built since. Controversy over their age—who, how and why they were built—has raged for as long as they have stood.\n\nIt reasons the ancients would focus resources on practical structures that paid dividends in higher productivity rather than pure ceremony, because that is WHAT WE DO. Modern civilization invests the vast majority of our resources to build plants, mines, factories, dams, roads, sewage and clean water systems—and a small amount on cemeteries, churches and monuments. The reason is obvious—it is necessary. Why wouldn't the same be true in ancient times?\n\nAuthor and engineer Andrew Hall explains how our ancient ancestors built with stone and utilized Earth’s energy beneath a Moon that appeared every other day, bringing with it plasma storms, earthquakes and swelling seas. \n\nGeoffrey Drumm\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@UCULur_fLEBk7bNj6LZaMZ8w \nhttps://thelandofchem.com/shop-books\n\nRory Duff\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEvSxc-fonc\n\nRoger G.

      "description": "Bill Mullen—an interdisciplinary scholar who examined the influence of planetary movement on ancient myths—shares his wisdom in this re-release of his EU2014 Conference presentation on March 23, 2014.\n\nMany catastrophist theories use hieroglyphics from around the world for clues in the ancient sky. The focus here is on Egyptian hieroglyphics relevant to both the Saturn and polar configuration theory. By studying and reading hieroglyphs in context, Bill shows which glyphs reveal preeminent clues that describe what our ancestors experienced.\n\nDr. William C. Mullen, (November 4, 1946 – November 2, 2017) received his BA in Classics from Harvard in 1968 and his PhD from the University of Texas in 1972. He was a Professor or post-doctoral Fellow at Berkeley, Princeton, Boston University, Harvard’s Center for Hellenic Studies, and St. John’s College. In 1985, he settled in the Classics Department at Bard College.\n---\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n---\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

The EU paradigm is moving scientific thinking towards a more refined definition of cosmology—one that encompasses everything we know about the universe, including ourselves.\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

      "description": "In Antarctica there's a petrified forest where today nothing bigger than bacteria grows. They look like Christmas trees that grew thick and tall—a thousand per acre, up to eighty feet—dating back to late Permian Period some 260 million years ago.\n\nFrom the catastrophist's viewpoint, this raises many questions. How accurate is the system used to date these trees? Geologists consider this figure accurate, along with the “known” age of the Earth.\n\nIt's all backed by absolute radiometric dating techniques. Fifty years ago, mainstream science was equally confident of a different age, and another age fifty years before that. How do we know they got it right this time?\n\nAuthor, EU advocate and narrator Matt Finn, describes how the electric force can flash freeze entire fields of flora and fauna, schools of fish, massive prehistoric trees, and even woolly mammoths.\n\nSOURCE MATERIAL\nTPOD: Antarctic Fossil Questions\nhttps://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2004/arch/041129antarctic-fossil.htm\nTPOD: Electric Fossils and Thundercrabs\nhttps://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/2013/10/06/electric-fossils-and-thundercrabs/\nIan Tresman: Catastrophism\nhttps://www.catastrophism.com/intro/\n\nComing soon—Matt Finn's “Breath of Life”— his first installment in The Aquarium Cycle, an enhanced audio sci-fi transcript.\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

      "description": "Narrated by David Drew. Second episode in the Misconception series on the EU Model—with an emphasis on how science is practiced, interpreted, publicized, and absorbed by society.\n\nThe simple answer to the question \"Where's the Science\" is that it's hidden in plain sight. This answer also includes the three i's: Ideology, Interpretation, and sheer Idiocy. \n\nWhile there is no lack of evidence for an Electric Universe, it suffers from an embarrassment of riches. The primary problem is the interpretation of observations, and this is where idiocy kicks in.\n\nOrthodox science has become ideological. It works with one tool in its box — gravity. Many space phenomena scream electricity, but plasmas and electromagnetism are difficult to model mathematically. Including them might deflate the elegant equations of theoretical physicists.\n\nAuthor and independent researcher David Drew, describes science vis-à-vis scientism with a challenge to the gravity-only paradigm: What do they have to fear?  \n\nClarification: At 7:46 the picture on the left is from CHANDRA (X-ray image) and the picture on the right is from EHT (radio-ray image). \n---\n\nMay 11, 2024\nMisconception #1: Where's the Problem? | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/I7mHSEzDs08\n\nJune 21, 2024\nMisconception #2: Where's the Science? | Thunderbolt\nhttps://youtu.be/JK90x5j-ykA\n\nAugust 24, 2024\nMisconception #3: Where's the Math? | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/a8Rhx4VRKAo\n\nOctober 5, 2024\nMisconception #4: Where's the Peer Review? | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/45PRP6HN2Io\n\nNovember 24, 2024\nMisconception #5: What About Gravity? | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/Svro-PWIkao\n\nDavid Drew aka The Soupdragon\nhttps://www.plasmacosmology.net/\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, subtitles are available.

The celebrated love affair between Venus and Mars is a central theme of Ev Cochrane's new book, \"The Case of the Turquoise Sun\", an extended monologue on ancient Creation myths.\n\nEv elucidates on the appeal of this millennia-old story—and what it says about the state of modern science. What's more trustworthy to reconstruct the history of the solar system—a computer simulation or eyewitness accounts and memories of our ancestors?  \n\nMesopotamian skywatchers saw Venus as the Queen of Heaven with Mars as her masculine lover, Sumerian texts describe their relationship as a Hieros Gamos (sacred marriage), Homer sang of their illicit sexual liaison, and \"Venus and Adonis\" was Shakespeare's first major work. \n\nProperly understood, much of the planetary history encoded in the myths of Mars and Venus revolutionizes our understanding of the solar system—and the origins of civilized architecture, dance, drama, music, religion, and even sports.\n\nA respected comparative mythologist, veteran Thunderbolts contributor Ev Cochrane is the author of Martian Metamorphoses (1997), The Many Faces of Venus (2001), Starf*cker (2006), On Fossil Gods and Forgotten Worlds (2010), Phaethon (2017), and, The Case of the Turquoise Sun (2024).\n---\n\nEPISODE 1 – March 30, 2024\nEv Cochrane: Turquoise Sun – Chronicle of Creation | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/N1jc4lOCtK4\n\nEPISODE 2 – April 20, 2024\nEv Cochrane: Turquoise Sun – Prequel to Discovery | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/_mD-GUNRo7U\n\nEPISODE 3 – June 15, 2024\nEv Cochrane: Turquoise Sun – Mars & Venus | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/1qdT75I9Fuw\n\nEPISODE 4 – August 17, 2024\nEv Cochrane: Turquoise Sun – Lotus of Creation | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/QPorzEueCBk\n\nEPISODE 5 – October 27, 2024\nEv Cochrane: Turquoise Sun – The Eye of Horus | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/RpvdEkAUXnQ\n\nBOOK – Published February 25, 2024\nEv Cochrane – The Case of the Turquoise Sun: A Natural History of Creation\nhttps://www.stickmanonstone.com/shop/p/the-case-of-the-turqoise-sun\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

      "description": "There are filaments originating from the Sun that connect matter, energy, and information out and back to every planet in the solar system. These coronal filaments have been known for decades, but only recently it was discovered that they encompass our entire solar system.\n\nEverything in the solar system lives inside the Body of the Sun—including you. If you traveled to that bright orb in the sky, you would arrive at the Heart, or the Brain, or nucleus of the Sun.\n\nThe Body of the Sun stretches to the Heliopause—but may even stretch further. Every year new data shows more connection between the stars, so if someone says the science is settled how stars are aligned in the galaxy, do not feel obliged to believe them.\n\nAstrophysicist Michael Clarage, PhD, describes solar filaments as plasma structures. When plasma is imbued with electromagnetic fields and currents—membranes and tubes are formed. This fact of nature occurs both in our biological Human Body—and in the Body of the Sun.\n----\n\nSOURCE ESSAY\nMichael Clarage\n\"Those Pesky Solar Filaments\"\nhttps://michaelclarage.substack.com/p/those-pesky-solar-filaments\n\nTOTAL ECLIPSE PHOTOS\nBray Falls, Astrophotographer\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/users/astrofalls\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

Systematic study is a human endeavor—power, greed and egotism play their part.

In 2008, it just stopped and literally vanished from view. A decade later, its weird emissions were detected again, except twisted in an inexplicable way indicating a wobbling star.\n\nIn a Science Alert news article dated April 10, 2024, Marcus Lower, an Australian astrophysicist at CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science, said, “Our results suggest there is a superheated plasma above the magnetar's magnetic pole, which is acting like a polarizing filter.

While the story of Newton is apocryphal, it was in the early 1900s when Birkeland trekked to the Norwegian Arctic, stood under the Aurora Borealis, and took measurements that revealed the presence of electric currents.\n\nPlasma is any substance that contains charged particles—negatively charged electrons, positively charged ions, or dust particles that have an excess of either electrons or ions. Fluorescent and neon lights are plasma. Lightning is plasma. Earth’s magnetosphere, the solar wind, and the sun itself are plasma. Those glowing nebulas in space—mistakenly labeled giant clouds of dust and gas; mainly star-forming regions like the \"Pillars of Creation\" in the Eagle Nebula—plasma. Full stop.\n\nEU advocate Matt Finn reminds us that as we look further out with the help of miraculous new instruments and technologies—such as the James Webb Space Telescope—it's undeniable we live in an electrically charged Universe.\n\nSOURCE MATERIAL – January 16, 2007\nTPOD: Bodies and Circuits\nhttp://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2007/arch07/070116bodiesandcircuits.htm\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

      "description": "At the beginning of the 1900s, it was thought an improved understanding of electromagnetism offered the best way forward for astronomy. It is unfortunate, therefore, that many have become frustrated at the pace of progress in the space sciences.\n\nAlthough most sciences have progressed leaps and bounds over the past hundred years, cosmology has fallen behind. Certainly, numerous space missions have enjoyed remarkable success, but is it a testament to the engineers and technicians—or—those theoreticians who are continually surprised by findings that almost always contradict expectations?\n\nSince July 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope has ramped up the cognitive dissonance as the spiraling, filamentary structure of the universe is being observed more clearly than ever—from an electrical plasma perspective.\n\nAuthor and independent researcher David Drew does not claim the EU Model has all the answers, but advocates it will help direct us Back to the Future and herald the next era of cosmology.\n\nOP ED: Looking Back to the Future: https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/2024/04/14/looking-back-to-the-future/\n\nDavid Drew aka The Soupdragon\nhttps://www.plasmacosmology.net/\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

      "description": "Jupiter’s magnetic field and its tremendous X-ray auroras are considerably more powerful than mainstream astronomical models predict. Attempts to explain the colossal electromagnetic Jovian environment is a poignant symbol of institutionalized science today—a clear case when observational data refuses to fit traditional models.\n\nAn example is found on the anomalous, roughly periodic phenomena in Jupiter’s atmosphere. Scientists—focused on an area of Jupiter dubbed the Great Blue Spot—were surprised the jet displayed “wave like fluctuations” that predictably repeated in almost four-year periods.\n\nIt's a big problem for standard theory. According to a phys.org report, “...the fluctuations might be related to convection-driven flows from within the metallic hydrogen pool that makes up a part of the planet's inner atmosphere. But such a jet would almost certainly have periodicity in centuries, not years...more data from Juno will better characterize the fluctuations found, perhaps leading to a better understanding of the planet's dynamo.”\n\nIndependent researcher Stuart Talbott ponders how such a statement as “better understanding of the planet’s dynamo” can blatantly appear in science media—much less scientific literature—since the magnetic field of any planet powered by an internal dynamo is NOT settled science.\n\nThe Talbott Bros' Fantastic Video Productions\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@fantasticvideoproductions/videos\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

For example, one can't talk sensibly about a beginning of the Universe since we don't know the origin of electric charge—and the nature of the electric force remains a mystery. \n\nThe EU Model does not offer any guesses and has no origin myth about the birth or the end of Everything. The good news, according to Wal Thornhill, is that we are not isolated by time and space in a dark Universe destined for a hopeless entropic demise.\n\nIn this final episode of a three-part series, EU advocate Matt Finn concludes his narration of Wal Thornhill's essay \"A Real 'Theory of Everything'\", where in Wal's view, the Everything must underpin cosmology.\n\nPART 1 OF 3 – March 9, 2024\nMatt Finn: Observations of Everything | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/x6x4Hp_krUI\n\nPART 2 OF 3 – March 16, 2024\nMatt Finn: Hypotheses of Everything | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/Zf1PzsouL1A\n\nSOURCE MATERIAL – January 1, 2006\nWal Thornhill – EU Views: A Real ‘Theory of Everything’\nhttps://www.holoscience.com/wp/a-real-theory-of-everything/\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

      "description": "Second episode of a three-arc narrative. An examination of why the Theory of Everything (ToE) may be out of reach for humanity. In the EU Model of Cosmology it may only be able to rise to a strong Hypothesis.\n\nWhen we inspect the Universe with our senses—augmented by modern technology—uncovering the fabric of reality doesn't seem so far fetched. Although we can only actually explain what is detected. At the extremes, things are either too big or too small to measure, and anything in-between will be overlooked if it doesn't fit the accepted criteria of influence and/or significance.\n\nFor example, when we accelerate electrons or protons in an electromagnetic field, the faster they go the less responsive to the fields they become. In mainstream science it's interpreted as an increase in mass, but charges don't have mass. How can this make sense?\n\nIn this second episode of a three-part series, EU advocate Matt Finn further extrapolates on Wal Thornhill's thoughts on the ToE and how to achieve a more realistic Hypothesis.\n\nPART 1 OF 3 – March 9, 2024\nMatt Finn: Observations of Everything | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/x6x4Hp_krUI\n\nPART 3 OF 3 – March 23, 2024\nMatt Finn: Theories of Everything | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/0aEUy_keLrQ\n\nSOURCE MATERIAL – January 1, 2006\nWal Thornhill – EU Views: A Real ‘Theory of Everything’\nhttps://www.holoscience.com/wp/a-real-theory-of-everything/\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

      "description": "Second episode of a two-arc narrative. Since 2022 there have been reports of the discovery of galaxies in the so-called early Universe which are not merely problematic, but 'impossible' in standard Big Bang cosmology. The overabundance of mature galaxies at the so-called dawn of time has one scientific paper proposing that the age of the Universe be doubled to 26 billion years old.\n\nSwinburne University of Technology — February 14, 2024 — \"Beyond what’s possible: New observations from the James Webb Space Telescope unearth mysterious ancient galaxy...how galaxies form and the nature of dark matter could be completely upended...a paper published today in Nature details a massive galaxy in the early universe—observed 11.5 billion years ago upends current modeling—has not enough dark matter built up in sufficient concentrations to seed their formation.”\n\nThe burden of proof in cosmology is inverted. Everyone has heard 'Extraordinary Claims Require Extraordinary Evidence', however, popular claims only seem to require a show of hands. Independent researcher Stuart Talbott takes on institutionalized science and their proclamation on how the Universe began. Stuart then expands on Wal Thornhill's fundamental question: What does it mean to be human?\n\nTWO-ARC NARRATIVE - EPISODE 1 \nFebruary 17, 2024\nStuart Talbott: Star Explodes Stellar Theory | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/vL2SGF79Zrg\n\nYouTube short by Stuart Talbott\nFebruary 25, 2024\nSun's SHOCKING Influence on Planets\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/lCEaEXrWv0Q\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

      "description": "Ev Cochrane details the origin of the myths of MARS, including its role in the polar configuration and why the red planet is seen as the paramour and husband of Inanna, the Queen of Heaven. This is a re-release of his conference presentation at EU2017.\n\nThe name for Mars comes from the cult of the Latin god Mars and that the characteristics of the Latin god are closely paralleled in the earliest Babylonian descriptions of the red planet. Far from being confined to the ancient Near East alone, the very same Mars-motifs are depicted in the New World, ancient China, and aboriginal Australia—yet few make any sense by reference to Mars today.\n\nA highly respected comparative mythologist, Ev Cochrane is the author of Martian Metamorphoses (1997), The Many Faces of Venus (2001), Starf*cker (2006), On Fossil Gods and Forgotten Worlds (2010), and Phaethon (2017).\n\nRead below from the back cover of Ev Cochrane's forthcoming new book, The Case of the Turquoise Sun (2024), summarizing nearly a half-century’s worth of research into ancient myth and archaeoastronomy. \n\n\"History matters, not only as an intellectual endeavor but because it remains with us at all times, shaping our lives in countless ways seen and unseen. Yet the history being taught at the top universities today is largely fictional in nature and in dire need of revision. This is nowhere more apparent than in modern astronomy and its uniformitarian understanding of the solar system’s recent history. The book before the reader provides compelling evidence that a different sun—a Turquoise Sun—dominated the sky well within the memory of Humankind. It is this Turquoise Sun which was the subject of creation myths around the globe, myths which continue to shape virtually every aspect of human civilization to this very day.\" \n----\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

A star this massive should have collapsed directly into a black hole when it died—do not pass supernova, do not collect weird element abundances.\n\nIndependent researcher Stuart Talbott details how technological data now routinely suggests both planet and star formation appear to happen on a timescale that is not reconcilable with with the slow, gradual processes of gravitational theory. A foundational tenet of the EU Model—which proposes electromagnetism governs the formation of celestial objects—are that eventually all cosmological timescales must be completely rethought.\n\nTWO-ARC NARRATIVE - EPISODE 2 \nMarch 2, 2024\nStuart Talbott: JWST Keeps Busting Big Bang | Thunderbolts\nhttps://youtu.be/Xo__2VAZjhQ\n\nCosmic Journey: Riding a Filament to the Heart of the Universe\nWritten and performed by Stuart Talbott\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A6A6DhYWow\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

      "description": "In 2003, the Journal of Scientific Exploration published \"Rocks that Crackle and Sparkle and Glow: Strange Pre-Earthquake Phenomena\" by Friedemann T. Freund, PhD. It's a ground-breaking testament of strange phenomena that precede large earthquakes.\n\nIt's a long and diverse list: bulging of the Earth's surface, changing well water levels, ground-hugging fog, low frequency electromagnetic emission, earthquake lights from ridges and mountain tops, magnetic field anomalies up to 0.5% of the Earth's dipole field, temperature anomalies by several degrees over wide areas as seen in satellite images, changes in the plasma density of the ionosphere, and strange animal behavior.\n\nTo illustrate how such diverse phenomena can have a common physical cause, EU advocate and Thunderbolts contributor Matt Finn expands on a Wal Thornhill essay demystifying the how and why the electric force plays a leading role in Earthquakes.\n\nWe commemorate the one-year passing of Wal Thornhill on February 7, 2023. His brilliant work, voice of reason, and genuine wisdom soldiers on the wellspring of the Electric Universe.\n\nSOURCE MATERIAL\nEU Views: Electric Earthquakes\nWal Thornhill - December 21, 2005\nhttps://www.holoscience.com/wp/electric-earthquakes/\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

      "description": "This is the story of the Star that nearly wiped-out humanity!\r Scholz star is a dim binary stellar system about 22 light years from Earth. Thousands of years ago this star system was an awful lot closer and it has been determined it passed within a mere 52,000 astronomical units from our own Sun. \n\nAround 74,000 years ago Earth underwent a catastrophic super-volcano eruption at what is now Lake Toba in Sumatra, Indonesia. The pyroclastic flows destroyed an area over 7,700 sq mi—with ash deposits as thick as 2,000 feet. It was twelve times greater compared to more recent 1815 Mount Tambora eruption, which caused The Year Without Summer of 1816.\r\n\nToba caused a global cooling that would last decades, devastating life. A ten-year volcanic winter triggered by the eruption could have largely destroyed the food source of humans, causing a severe reduction in the population size—creating a bottleneck in human evolution. \n\nWe mark the start of Year #4 of the Thunderbolts show with Gareth Samuel, creator of \"See the Pattern” and EU advocate. Gareth tells the story of our planet's 10,000 sole survivors of Toba who rebuilt the human race—based on coalescence evidence of DNA and the relatively low level of genetic variation in humans.\n\nGareth Samuel | See the Pattern\n• YouTube  https://www.youtube.com/c/SeethePattern\n\nAdditional Information...\nElectric Arcs on Jupiter's Moon Io | Space News\nhttps://youtu.be/zEHuvM4Tc3U\nIo and the Electric Universe | EU Views\nhttps://www.holoscience.com/wp/io-and-the-electric-universe/\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n--\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.

      "description": "\"As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.\"\n― ALBERT EINSTEIN 1879-1955\nAddress to the Prussian Academy of Sciences\nBerlin, January 27, 1921\n\nAlbert Einstein is a cultural phenomenon. His face is still regularly splashed across electronic and print media. He also has a lot of critics, although you don't hear too much about them from popular science sources. \n\nTo summarize his philosophical viewpoint—math should be ancillary, not dominant. Making science subservient to mathematics is putting the cart before the horse. Heavier-than-air flight was impossible over one hundred years ago…they had the math to prove it. \n\nDoubt is supposed to be at the heart of good science. While Einstein’s fan club hang on almost every word he uttered, they ignore his many doubts.\n\n\"You can imagine that I look back on my life's work with calm satisfaction. But from nearby it looks quite different. There is not a single concept of which I am convinced that it will stand firm, and I feel uncertain whether I am in general on the right track.\" \n― ALBERT EINSTEIN 1879-1955\nPersonal letter to Maurice Solovine, 1949\n\nAuthor and independent researcher David Drew is a seasoned EU Advocate. Since 2004 he has been a champion of EU logic and reasoning via his historical and educational resource, Plasma Cosmology.\n\nTHUNDERBLOG \nw/more detail and additional information\n\"OP ED: Einstein and the Cult of Celebrity\"\nWritten by David Drew\nhttps://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/2024/01/27/einstein-and-the-cult-of-celebrity/\n\nDavid Drew aka The Soupdragon\nhttps://www.plasmacosmology.net/\n\nIdeas and/or concepts presented on this channel do not necessarily express or represent the Electric Universe Model of Cosmology, The Thunderbolts Project, or T-Bolts Group Inc.\n\n----\nIf you see a CC with this video, it means that subtitles are available.
