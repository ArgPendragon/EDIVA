In this instance, as in many\nothers, however, no borrowing need be\ncalled for. What is at bottom here is that\nwhatever it was that Dionysus had originally\nstood for was the very same thing that the\nEgyptian Osiris had originally represented.\nOr, to put it in a simpler way, Osiris and\nDionysus were representations of the same\noriginal phenomenon; they were simply one\nand the same god under different national\nguise.\n\nOthers, of course, have maintained that\nthe similarity of Greek rituals to those of the\nEgyptians stems from the ignorance of the\nGreeks in matters Egyptian. Thus, for in-\nstance, Gwyn Griffiths tried to convince his\nreaders that Greek observers were “not usu-\nally in a position” to understand Egyptian\nreligion particularly because of their igno-\nrance of the Egyptian language.” Thus, ac-\ncording to Griffiths, Greek theological ex-\nplanations of Egyptian religious particulars\nand mythological equations were based on\nDionysus.",

As we have seen, despite the odd dissenter, modern opinion mainly reflects that of the\nGreeks themselves who seem to have attained a degree of unanimity—by no means the ac-\ncustomed expectancy—on this particular subject. Let us not, after all, forget that the very\nword “tragedy,” in Greek tragodia, means nothing more than “goat song,” derived from fra-\ngos, that is “goat,” the sacred animal of Dionysus. Despite its enigmatic name, the goat song\nitself was sung in honor of Dionysus, describing his birth and violent end. That the term\n“goat song” — tragodia—became a synonym for “misfortune” is therefore understandable.\nChristians, if no one else, can at least understand this much: What could be more tragic than\nthe violent death of a god?",

And, to be sure, the reliability of oral\ntradition has been the subject of controversy since the time of Euhemerus.®\n\nIn our own world, as we all know, different eyewitnesses are liable to offer different ver-\nsions of any single event even when the reports are collected within a very short time of the\noccurrence. Not only that, but, with each telling, each report becomes more embellished until\nall semblance of truth is muddied beyond recognition. Can you imagine the reliability of such\nreports being handed down by word-of-mouth over a few thousand years?\n\nAnd yet, as Dorothy Vitaliano shrewdly observed, how often have parents retold a bed-\ntime story only to be found corrected if they deviate by as much as a single word from the\noriginal version told?

                "content": "without the aid of a written language, up until the advent of the colonial period.“\n\nAs Peter Hallberg pointed out in relation to the Icelandic skalds, when history is transmit-\nted through a succession of professional bards with highly trained memories and powers of\ntecollection, there is reason to believe that, when put into writing even after a few centuries,\nthe details remain more than reasonably accurate.® Thus Alfred de Grazia was echoing re-\nceived opinion when he stated:\n\n“We know from general anthropology and ancient literature that an exact rendition of\n can be\ntransmitted over generations and centuries...[I]n the period of oral transmission,\ntrained speakers can memorize and reproduce exactly thousands of lines heard from\nthe lips of a teacher.”\n\nTo paraphrase Peter Warlow’s astute words, the main secret behind the retention and im-\nmediate recall of any part, or all, of a particular epic, regardless of its enormity of lines, is the\nsystematic learning by rote, or repetition. As he aptly demonstrated, this is made evident by\nthe effortless recail of nursery rhymes learned by rote in early childhood together with other\npoems and quotations drummed into youngsters in school and college. It is by rote, which\nWarlow calls “the basic way,” that every child learns the complexities of speech, the\nchronological order of the alphabet, the days in the month, multiplication tables, spelling\naids, and other fundamentals in the early garnering of knowledge. He was nowhere near ex-\naggerating when he referred to rote learning as “an incredibly powerful technique.””\n\nIt has also been hypothesized that the hexameter of Homer’s verses was inherited from an\nearlier oral tradition and that it was this very hexameter that helped preserve the epics.* If\nthis was so, verbatim memorization may not even have been necessary. According to Milman\nParry, the hexameters of poetic sagas such as the Iliad and Odyssey are not simply con-\nstructed of word-units but of formulas. These constitute “groups of words [co-ordinated pre-\ncisely] for dealing with traditional materials, each formula shaped to fit a hexameter line.”\n\nThus, for instance, as Walter Ong noted, the phrase “there spoke out clever Odysseus”\noccurs seventy two times in Homer’s poems.” Such a formula would be easy to remember\nevery time Odysseus is introduced to say something.\n\nPersonally, I disagree emphatically with Ong when, from this, he also surmises that\nOdysseus was thought of as being clever—“polymetis”—not because he was supposed to\nhave been, but because “without the epithet polymetis he could not be readily worked into the\nmeter.”* According to Ong, all of Homer’s characters, including the deities, received their\ntime-worn epithets in order to fit the correct metrical lines of the epics in which they appear.\nThis is difficult to believe when one remembers that the same, or similar, epithets were be-\nstowed on the comparative deities of other nations which appear in poetic sagas employing\nan entirely different meter from that of Homer. In various other cases, deities carry the same\n",

Even so, Ong’s forceful\nconclusion need not affect the validity of Parry’s approach.\n\nIn recent years, an interesting experiment was conducted by Hildegard Wiencke-Lotz\nwho traveled some 45,000 miles through Europe in an all-encompassing effort to track the\nvarious versions of the Gudrun Epic still “sung” in those parts and to verify, if possible, the\nhistoricity of its setting and occurrences. Previously believed to be “little more than a fairy\ntale in three parts, of which the middie part possibly reflected some historical events,” the\nGudrun Epic was demonstrated by Wiencke-Lotz to be “an ancient oral tradition representing\na unified whole which loses its meaning when the three parts are considered separately.” As\nDavid Griffard, relying on notes by William Douglas, as well as the work of Wiencke-Lotz\nherself, was able to report:\n\n“fWiencke-Lotz] argues that the entire Gudrun Epic has a sound historical basis and\nthat all specific places mentioned can be found where expected geographically,\nthough their distribution covers a large geographical area. She has identified and vis-\nited the numerous places named in the tales and has traced the specific period of Gu-\ndrun’s life in relation to Roman history.”®\n\nWhat emerged from this study is that the epic is exclusively indigenous to those territo-\nries which had, at one time or another, been occupied by the Goths.
