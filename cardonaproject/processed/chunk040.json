                    "content": "The axial tilt debate then spilled into the early years of the twentieth century. Thus, in 1929, Harold Jeffreys could still ask: “Has the inclination of the Earth’s axis to the plane of its orbit varied during its history?” As he himself confessed: “The answer to [this] question is a definite ‘Yes!’” By 1937, W. B. Wright continued to maintain that “the Earth’s axis of rotation has not always had the same position” and that the “many changes of the position of the climatic zones on the surface of the Earth” were “due to a displacement of the pole from its present position.” In 1950, Velikovsky provided an explanation for the tilting of Earth’s axis as having been due to close terrestrial interactions with the planets Venus and Mars at different epochs during historical times. Forgetting that past giants of science had debated the possibility, his detractors, among them even some astronomers, maintained that terrestrial axial shifts had never been heard of and that the notion is not supported by scientific literature. Beyond stating my firm belief that the cosmic catastrophes described in Worlds in Collision were unfortunately displaced in time by Velikovsky, the present work has nothing to offer concerning the possibility of terrestrial axial shifts during historical times. My main interest here concerns the much earlier Tertiary period. In this respect, it is noteworthy that when, in the 1980s, remains of sub-tropical flora and fauna were discovered by Soviet scientists in Spitsbergen, the axial tilt hypothesis was revived and, as of this writing, continues to be the standing Russian understanding of what had to have transpired in ages past. In the early 1980s, scientists proved the far North had once been a tropical paradise. The tilt of the Earth shifted and so did the weather. Most scientists on the American continent, however, were not convinced. As Johnson pointed out, Basinger, a Canadian, “would rather contemplate a plant/animal ecosystem that has no uniformitarian counterpart on today’s Earth.” But, as Johnson argued: How does one warm Earth’s polar regions in the Pliocene by 90° Fahrenheit without raising tropical temperatures to those of present equatorial areas, while frying the equatorial areas and drying them out? “[I]t is not reasonable to postulate a polar heat build-up that somehow misses the torrid zones of the Earth.”",

                    "content": "High-temperature environments in the Pliocene Antarctic and the Eocene High Arctic are geophysically unreasonable. To conform with thermodynamics and an Earth tilted 23 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic [as at present], these environments had to be considerably closer to the equator. If they were closer to the equator, then either continental drift occurred both much more rapidly and mysteriously than the geological record indicates, or else the Earth has tilted or experienced crustal slippage in some fashion that allowed warming of these lands without disrupting the continuity of equatorial rainforests. Another mechanism has the Earth with little or no tilt to its axis of rotation, which removes seasonality and ensures light each day on each point of the globe, coupled with a dense canopy that allows much more even temperatures despite variation in latitude. According to Bernard Delair, theoretically, Earth ought to rotate on a vertical axis “and may actually have done so in the geologically recent past.” And: “There ought to be no reason why any Earth-like planet undisturbed for untold ages should not have a vertically-positioned axis.” Unfortunately, there are various problems with the axial tilt hypothesis. To begin with, Delair’s declaration did not go unchallenged. As Michael Reade pointed out, “a spinning ball forced to traverse an elliptical orbit around a primary would adopt a tilted attitude.” As he, in turn, assured his readers, “it is never possible to get a free-spinning ball to spin with its axis either vertical or horizontal: the principal axis of the ball always settles to a well-defined and seemingly invariable angle of tilt.” This, as Reade pointed out, “has long been known to engineers: spinning bodies, such as turbines or speed governors, impose asymmetric stresses on their shaft bearings.” True, as Jane Francis noted, had Earth’s axis been perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, the Sun would have bathed the polar regions with twelve hours of light every day. At the poles, however, the Sun’s rays would have been weak and low-angled, similar to those experienced just before sunset. This would have been insufficient for the growth of plants such as the remains of which have been discovered in polar regions. Why not then propose a model which would combine both theories? Would not a perpendicular Earth orbiting around the Sun with Saturn stationed at Earth’s north celestial pole fill the bill? Not really, because, for one thing, this would be contrary to what the mytho-historical record has to tell us. We have seen that, time and again, the record states that during the age of semi-darkness, the Sun was not yet visible. And there is no point in appealing to the Pleiongaea hypothesis to account for this invisibility.",

                    "content": "At bottom lies this additional fact: While the axes of the Solar System planets point in different directions, those of Saturn and Earth come close to coinciding. Saturn is tilted at 26.7 degrees while Earth’s tilt is at 23.45 degrees. Both axes point to about the same spot in space. Saturn’s present north star is the same as Earth’s—Polaris. This is a situation that would be expected had Saturn and Earth once shared the same axis of rotation as our main thesis demands. What this seems to indicate is that, despite Delair’s assurance to the contrary, Earth’s present axial tilt is the most natural one for it to possess, and that it has not changed since at least the Tertiary period. What then of a perpendicular axis with an Earth in phase-lock outside the Solar System as posited by Ken Croswell for red dwarf planets? This, too, fails to fill the bill because, as we have already noted, while Croswell’s theoretical system would entail a world without variable seasons, it does not occasion one universal spring-like climate. True enough, the climate would not have been variable, but tropical and equatorial regions would still have been much warmer than the poles. The poles, in fact, would have been the recipients of low slanting rays and if such slanting rays from our own Sun would have been inadequate to allow the thriving of sub-tropical flora and fauna at the poles, neither would the slanting rays from a red or brown dwarf star. What if we were to adapt Croswell’s phase-locked system by having it encased within the totally warm plasma sheath we have already postulated for the proto-Saturnian system? Light and warmth would then have reached all latitudes in equal proportion without having to rely on an axial alignment, which we have already posited as the most difficult mechanical configuration to maintain.",

What is not acceptable is that the axial alignment came into being upon the Saturnian system’s entry into our present Sun’s domain. Is evidence concerning any of the above at least available from other planets of the Solar System? Only to an extent because, after all, as far as the Solar System is concerned, the case for Saturn presented above is unique—which is not to say that similar systems might not yet be discovered out in space. Meanwhile, the extent to which other planets can provide some evidence, no matter how slim, is exemplified by Uranus. Lyle Broadfoot, for instance, was surprised to discover what he termed an electroglow bathing the sunlit side of Uranus. Its energy source still remains unknown. As we have posited for proto-Saturn, Philip Nicholson has also posited the one-time existence of a nebular cloud, or circumstellar disk, around Uranus. As we have already seen, very much like the Saturnian system we have been describing, the temperature of Uranus is globally uniform, even though, again like proto-Saturn, its north pole was found to be warmer than the rest of the planet. Of added interest here is that when Voyager 2 made this discovery, the north pole had been in darkness for forty years.",

                    "content": "THE BOREAL CRADLE Heer’s study of fossil Arctic flora led him to postulate that the Arctic had served as the center of new generations of plants which then radiated south to America, Europe, and Asia. “These migrations of new plant species and groups, which originated in the Arctic and then became closely related ‘vicarious’ species through simultaneous differentiation, elegantly account for the mysterious similarity of tree and shrub vegetation in such scattered locations as eastern Asia and Atlantic North America. This theory also explained the resemblance noted by Heer of the Tertiary flora of Europe and the recent flora of eastern Asia and Atlantic North America.” As Johnson noted, while Heer’s theory dates to the late 19th century, his “notion of an Arctic evolutionary cradle is startlingly modern, in line with the work of Dawson and Hickey” to which we shall come anon. E. C. Pielou, on the other hand, reminded her readers of photoperiodism which presents an “apparent obstacle to long, northward and southward migration of plants” since such migrations would have moved said plants out of their physiological niche. Long-day plants, for instance, cannot survive in the tropics, while short-day plants cannot thrive in more northern latitudes. This is because the photoperiodic length varies from latitude to latitude and from season to season. Because day and night lengths in the tropics approximate twelve hours each all year round, photoperiodic variations are small to non-existent. In the mid-temperate regions, photoperiodic spans can vary from up to nine hours in December to up to sixteen hours in June. In the present Arctic regions, photoperiodicity drops to zero in December, rising as high as twenty-four hours in June. All this, however, would have been of very little, if any, importance during the Tertiary if Earth had basked under a continuous and universal sub-tropical climate and light regime as seems to be indicated by the evidence presented above. In the case at hand, the climatic requirements would have been close to identical the world over. Migrating plants would not have had to vacate any physiological niches; they would merely have radiated into new areas the climatic properties of which would have been nearly identical to the ones of their origin. In the end, it is the available evidence that counts. Does the evidence support the theory of a Tertiary plant migration from the Arctic into more southerly latitudes? We have seen above that Johnson claimed that Heer’s nineteenth-century theory of just such a migration is in line with the modern work of Dawson and Hickey.",

                    "content": "In the Canadian Arctic, Mary Dawson discovered tapirs and flying lemurs which were closely associated in geologic context. But, further south, the tapir was found in a Middle Eocene context, while the flying lemur appeared in an Early Eocene stratum. Meanwhile, Leo Hickey, who had already spent twenty years studying Eocene flora, came to the conclusion that plants, together with marine invertebrates, had risen earlier in the Arctic than in the mid-latitudes. Ancestors of the horse, camel, rhinoceros, land tortoises, together with the flying lemur and such trees as the Mexican elm, walnut, and the redwood, originated millions of years earlier in the polar regions. “Dawson and Hickey in the early 1980s co-authored a paper in Science where they argued that certain plants show up in the fossil record 18 million years earlier in the Arctic than elsewhere while some animals evolved 2 to 4 million years ahead of their time north of the Arctic Circle.” An alternative way in which the theory of Pleiongaea could be brought in line with the Saturnian model is if Earth’s dense atmospheric envelope exhibited a north polar clearing—a hole if you wish. This would bring our thesis perilously close to that advocated in 1886 by Isaac Newton Vail, propounded further by his modern defender, Donald Cyr and, in a different but slightly similar vein, by Dolph Earl Hooker plus, to a certain extent, even by Milton Zysman. All of these authors—from whom the present writer disassociates himself—have proposed a terrestrial canopy of sorts, although not all of them have included the polar opening. Meanwhile, such a polar opening in a planet’s atmosphere is not all that foreign in the Solar System. Venus has such a polar opening—a “huge hollow” 1,000 kilometers wide—in its own dense atmosphere right over its north pole, through which the Sun might possibly be shining. If such was the case, the Saturnian sun, complete with its nebular disk, would have been clearly seen through the opening. More than that, it would have warmed Earth’s Arctic regions even more effectively. Unfortunately, a lamentable objection has to be raised against this hypothesis since, as we have already seen, the proximity of the proto-Saturnian sun would have raised Earth’s atmosphere in a tide precisely above Earth’s north polar region. Thus, if a Pleiongaea-like atmosphere did prevail, it would have lacked a polar opening. In the meantime, what Hickey and Dawson’s discoveries seem to demand is a north polar sun emplacement exactly as hypothesized in this volume. Thus, in addition to a universal climatic regime which would have warmed Earth throughout all its latitudes, a direct radiant source at the very top of the world would have ensured that Earth’s Arctic regions would have been slightly warmer earlier than the rest of the globe.",
