        "content": "Chapter 7 THE UNSTABLE SOLAR SYSTEM Since Earth is no longer a satellite of Saturn, it becomes obvious that the planets of the Solar System have been shuffled around since that time. And here another objection may be raised because such shuffling around would be seen by some as violating Bode’s Law, to say nothing of the stability of the Solar System. References concerning the belief in the immutability of the Solar System as a whole, and of its planets in particular, are not required since this one-time verity has been vouched for by many an astronomer and astrophysicist since the dawn of modern astronomical observation. It will be pointed out, for instance, that Simon Laplace (1749-1827) mathematically proved the near-eternal stability of the planets of the Solar System, which work was carried forward and supposedly improved upon by Joseph Lagrange and Siméon Poisson. In studying the work of Laplace, however, we find that what he presented was turned into a uniformitarian dogma against his intentions. Regardless of what historians of science have made of his so-called proofs, he himself was not averse to celestial disorder. “The sky itself, despite the orderliness of its movements,” he wrote, “is not unalterable.” As far as he was concerned, the stability of the present system is itself “disturbed by various causes that can be ascertained by careful analysis, but which are impossible to frame within a calculation.” More than that, he found himself wondering whether the heavenly bodies of the Solar System might be affected by forces other than gravitation, that is whether electric and magnetic energies might also play a role. As Peter Warlow described the entire matter: “...the first thing we must say here is that, contrary to an often-repeated statement, no-one has ever proved that the Solar System has been, or will be, stable for any significant length of time. The statement has its beginnings about two hundred years ago, and stems from the work of the Marquis de Laplace, who spent much of his life working out a mathematical model for the Solar System. The model was based on the assumption that Newton was right in attributing all of the motions to the effect of gravity alone, and it was limited to a consideration of the major bodies alone—the main planetary bodies plus the Sun. The thirty or so other major bodies [since then many more], in the form of the main satellites of the planets, were ignored.” And: “Laplace, himself, fully appreciated the limitations of his model, and he recognized that it was quite possible for the system to become disturbed, either as a result of the appearance of a new body into the system, or by some change of the bodies already within the system. Indeed, it would probably be appropriate to class him as a catastrophist, and it is rather ironic that his name has been taken so much in vain by uniformitarians.”",

        "content": "This, however, is not the place to review the impetus that Laplace’s mathematics had on those astronomers who came later and the extent to which they saw fit to reinterpret his work in order to force-fit it into their uniformitarian, and even religious, prejudices. As we will soon see, belief in this matter has changed considerably since the days of Laplace. V. Szebehely and R. McKenzie have even contested G. Hills’ much earlier postulate of a stable Sun-Earth-Moon system, and have themselves reached the conclusion that the Moon may someday escape from Earth to become itself a planet. Thus, if the Moon can yet escape Earth’s attraction to become an independent planet, what is so bizarre about another satellite, in this instance Earth itself, escaping the clutches of Saturn to become the autonomous planet it now is? The Moon, however, is not the only celestial body in our system that has recently been calculated to be capable of an orbital change. Computer simulations by Gerald Sussman have indicated that the orbits of the inner four planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are unstable and liable to future orbital changes. Doug Lin had also suggested as far back as 1982 “that planets like Jupiter could migrate from the outer solar system in toward their parent stars.” While these are processes which are thought to take millions of years, the important thing to remember, for the time being, is that the new Science of Chaos shows beyond a reasonable doubt that the Solar System is not the “paragon of predictability that was once imagined,” and that Laplace’s deterministic world view no longer holds. What now turns up is that resonance pervades the Solar System and that it probably acts through tidal effects. As further computer retrocalculations conducted by Archie Roy and his team have shown, the orbits of the smaller bodies of the Solar System are actually chaotic and unpredictable. And then, in a study of planetary perturbations performed by John Bagby, it was found that such computer simulations as the ones described above are not, of themselves, reliable beyond a certain length of time. As he had it stated: “I found that every outer planet all the way in to at least Mars, was so perturbed by some as yet unmodeled cause that their orbits needed to be computerized every ten years.” While Bagby’s simulations had to do with the outer planets, as opposed to the orbits of the inner ones simulated by Sussman, Roy, et al, it should be noted that Mars was included in both studies.",

        "content": "Bagby himself reached the conclusion that a tenth planet, dubbed “X,” or a stellar companion, orbited the Sun beyond the orbit of Uranus, and that it was this massive object that was causing the perturbations of the outer planets. But while Bagby’s Planet “X” has yet to materialize, the perturbations of the outer planets remain real. THE TITIUS-BODE LAW But what, one might ask, of the spacing between the planetary orbits dictated by Bode’s Law? Would this law not be violated had Earth once been a satellite of Saturn? Bode’s Law was actually discovered by Johann Daniel Titius of Wittenberg, Germany, in 1772. But because it was brought to prominence by Johann Elert Bode, another German astronomer—some say actually stolen by him!—it has become known by his name. What is this law? In order of distances, the planets of the Solar System moving outward from the Sun are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. What Titius discovered was that if we take the number 3, double it, then double the result, and keep on doubling in that manner, we end up with the series 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, etc. Adding 4 to each of these numbers results in the series 7, 10, 16, 28, 52, 100, etc. If we then divide each of these numbers by 10, we finally end up with 0.7, 1, 1.6, 2.8, 5.2, 10, and so on. What is extraordinary about this final series is that it turns out to be in fair agreement with the actual mean distances of each planet from the Sun, still moving outward, when measured in astronomical units. Where this law was at first thought to fail was in its fourth placement, since there is no planet to be found at 2.8 astronomical units from the Sun. But then, when the asteroid belt was discovered between Mars and Jupiter close enough to this position, Bode’s Law became engraved in granite—never mind that the law breaks completely down when it comes to Neptune and Pluto. It was then “established” that the effects of this law had manifested themselves early in the history of the Solar System. But, in 1960, Robert Bass demonstrated mathematically that planets tend to space themselves in a Bode’s Law type series of orbits, by what he termed the Principle of Least Mean Potential Energy, even if initially disturbed. Thus the Bode formula—for that is all it really is—reveals absolutely nothing about the original spacing of the Solar System planets. This was validated in 1968 by the then Soviet theoretician A. M. Molchanov, who claimed that Bode’s Law is actually the result of orbital resonances and that it could not be of primeval origin. This was again stressed seven years later by Michael Ovenden, who renamed Bass’ earlier axiom as the Principle of Least Interaction Action, when he reached a conclusion identical to Molchanov’s—that the present distribution of the planetary and satellite orbits is the result of mutual perturbations.",

        "content": "mined from all this is that “the present distribution gives no information concerning the origin of the solar system.” In 1970, J. G. Hills computed simulations of the N-body problem and discovered that “arbitrary planetary configurations, started with purely random initial positions and velocities, tend, during a few thousand to a few hundred thousand subsequent years, to ‘relax’ into a Bode’s-law type of resonant configuration.” So much, then, for “millions of years.” Now it is true that the planetary system that relaxed the fastest in Hills’ simulations, at something like 2000 years, consisted of the Sun with four planets, each of which contained ten times the mass of the Jovian planets—hardly a portrait of our Solar System. However, the actual planetary composition of this simulation is not the central issue being discussed here. What is important to keep in mind is that Hills showed that, under certain conditions, planets can relax into a Bode’s Law type of configuration within a comparatively short time. And this is important because, up to then, this had generally been thought to be impossible—which, if nothing else, proves that what is thought to be impossible in astronomy today may be thought of as being quite possible tomorrow. Actually, as Bass informed his readers in 1974, the phenomenon discovered by Hills was foreseen by Ernest Brown as early as 1931 but no one seems to have paid him any heed. What all this implies is that Bode’s Law is an empiricism based on the present spacing of the planets. Lynn Rose explained it best: “It is usually not the case that mathematical gimmickry comes first, and that an inventory of the heavens is taken later. Usually the heavenly body count comes first, and the tissue of mathematical rationalization is developed later. Thus Kepler first considered that there were six bodies orbiting the Sun—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn [since the rest had not yet been discovered]—and then invented his scheme involving the five regular solids to explain why there could be only those six bodies. And in the eighteenth century, when Titius was working on his law and Bode was stealing it, the properties of the known bodies were examined first, and then the artificial mathematical formula—now known as ‘Bode’s Law’—was developed in an effort to rationalize what was already known.” In fact, one of the most reputable encyclopedias of astronomy has it stated that “the Titius-Bode Law...is most probably a mere coincidence.” Be that as it may, when it comes to the actual Solar System, Hills’ above-described model suggested to him that a reasonable estimate for the relaxation of the Jovian planets into their present orbits would be between 100,000 and a million years. Thus, while it may be pointed out that Bass himself was more concerned with the orbital crossings of an erratic Venus as proposed by Immanuel Velikovsky, which does not concern us here, than he was with the Jovian giants, Hills’ conclusion may be said to bode disaster for the Saturnian scenario being proposed here. After all, a hundred thousand to a million years would hardly place our posited event within human memory.",

        "content": "What must not be lost track of, however, is that these computer simulations, as well as Ovenden’s calculations, involve point-particle (or point-mass) motions and not those of semi-rigid solid bodies. This, also, is important because, according to point-particle Newtonian mechanics, the relaxation of planets into resonant orbits would be reversible. It was for this reason that, despite Ovenden’s own disclaimer, Bass suggested the inclusion of tidal friction as this would be one way of breaking this reversing tendency. Hills, as later Ovenden, saw no reason to take this drag into consideration. Had they done so, their results would have been entirely different. As Bass indicated, the addition of tidal friction “could put the planets on to vastly different orbits.” Personally, I will not claim that tidal friction, or tidal friction alone, would resolve the Saturnian problem. In the meantime, however, it should be kept in mind that Bass was not relying on Hills’ discovery as much as he was on an adaptation of it. Eventually, Ovenden’s Principle of Least Interaction Action failed in predicting the present orbits of the Jovian planets. Ovenden could only save his Principle by postulating the one-time existence of an additional massive object and then getting rid of it at some point in time. According to this postulate—which, at first glance, should seem wilder than the one being proposed in this work—the Solar System has still not reached equilibrium (which reminds us very much of Bagby’s postulate concerning his undiscovered planet as the cause for planetary perturbations). Ovenden placed the catastrophe which got rid of his one-time planet at 16 million (1.6 X 10^7) years ago, while also stating that it would take something like another 280 million (2.8 X 10^8) years for the Solar System to reach complete equilibrium (thus allowing his Principle of Least Interaction Action to fulfill itself). Since, however, I am here only concerned with the past and present orbits of the planets, Ovenden’s 280 million years of future orbital re-adjustments are irrelevant to our case. But we will take note that, according to Ovenden, the present near-equilibrium of the Solar System is not its final stage—that, in fact, the Solar System is still adjusting to a relatively recent planetary shuffle. Needless to say, it will again be pointed out that an event which supposedly occurred 16 million years ago is hardly “recent.” But let us not get carried away just yet because one thing that Ovenden himself stressed takes the wind out of the above objection. “...if it can be shown that processes operate within the solar system that can rearrange the planetary orbits on a sufficiently short time-scale then we must conclude that the present distribution of planetary and satellite orbits contain no information about conditions at the time of formation of the solar system.” This was expanded on later by Archie Roy when he wrote: “We have seen that the work of J. G. Hills and M. W. Ovenden demonstrated that after a short period of wild behaviour, a planetary system could settle down into a distribution of orbits very similar to a commensurable Bode-type configuration. Such a configuration would, under the action of other forces such as tidal friction, nudge the system into a neighbouring truly stable configuration, which on inspection might be",
