        "content": "Incorporating the very name of El. Interpretations of the name have included such laudations as \"he who fights for El,\" \"he whom El fights,\" \"the upright one of El,\" and other similarities, but none of these are true to the etymology of the name. The name \"Israel\" appears first in the Book of Genesis where the Patriarch Jacob is described as having wrestled with a mysterious stranger, at the end of which the stranger told Jacob: \"Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with Elohim and with men, and hast prevailed.\" The name Israel was, therefore, bestowed on Jacob because he \"prevailed\" like a prince over the stranger with the power of Elohim. And, as it has been assumed by others before me, the name \"Israel\" is composed of the word sarah—\"to prevail\"—and \"El.\" Thus it might not be amiss to say that \"Israel\" most likely means \"to prevail like El\" or \"let El prevail.\" As Ronald Hendel argued, El was the oldest god of the Israelites. This is evidenced by the fact that, in the Old Testament, up until the time of the Exodus, theophoric names incorporate only the name of El (as, for example, Israel, Ishmael, and Bethuel). This coincides with what is known of Canaanite religion in the pre-Israelite period. \"The evidence, from Ugarit in the north to Sinai in the south, testifies that during [the pre-Israelite period] the high god of various local Canaanite pantheons was named El.\" Murtonen goes even further when he states that the name can be traced to primitive times. \"That 'el is a very primitive word is proved by 1) its existence in all the Semitic languages with the (possible) exception of Ethiopic...2) the fact that it was composed of only two radicals...and 3) that these radicals are numbered among the most primitive ones.\" As for the origin of El, the same authority informs us: \"El itself can have been derived only from a concrete conception, i.e., from immediate experience. In other words, the question is philologically unsolvable.\" Philologically unsolvable—perhaps; but not necessarily cosmogonically so, as we shall soon see. We start by asking the question: What could this \"concrete conception,\" this \"immediate experience,\" of which Murtonen speaks, have been? Having already touched upon the subject on an earlier page, the identity of El should not surprise the reader. Even so, for starters we mention here the fact that, in Akkadian inscriptions, the phonetic writing for El (or Il) is sometimes used for the logogram otherwise read as An. In god lists found at Mari, the two names are interchangeable. As Alfred Eaton disclosed: \"It is known that the name El was written with the sign AN (Ik-ru-ub-AN and Ik-ru-ub-Il)...\" In discussing the same material, Herman Wohlstein argues simply for an identification of El/An as a tutelary deity, an equation that could only have been reached because of the widespread acceptance of El, by Jews and Christians alike, as a name simply meaning \"God.\" But that \"El\" was",

        "content": "Originally a proper name has been shown by Murtonen. Meanwhile, as we have already seen, the god An and/or Anu was a personification of the planet Saturn. Julius Morgenstern tells us that, in his role of the all-knowing god, \"El seems to have much in common with the Babylonian deity, Enki-Ea, the all-wise one.\" And, on an earlier page, we have shown that Enki/Ea is also identifiable as the same planet Saturn. None of this should really surprise anyone. As Frank Moore Cross indicated, El was the chief deity of the Mesopotamian Semites, as he was also that of the pre-Islamic Arabs besides the Canaanites. In fact it has long been known that the pre-Islamic Allah traces to the same root as El or Eloah. Cross also cites evidence which equates El with the Egyptian Ptah (yet another deity we have already seen identified as Saturn) as also with Ba'al (of whom we shall have more to say elsewhere). William Albright equated El with the Assyro-Babylonian Shamash which, once again, we have already shown to be an alternate name for the planet Saturn. William Heidel goes straight to the heart of the matter when he tells us that \"Cronos [or Kronos—the Greek name for the planet Saturn] is called El by the Phoenicians.\" This identification traces to the Phoenician scholar Sanchoniathon himself, as quoted by Philo of Byblos, who identified the Canaanite El with the Greek Kronos. As Cross submitted: \"Philo Byblius, and other classical sources, and inscriptions in Greek and Latin all establish the formula that B'l Hmn [i.e., Ba'al Hamon] on the one hand, and El on the other, are Greek Kronos, Latin Saturnus.\" Moreover, as Cross admits: \"These equations have long been known, and all new data confirm the ancient.\" Albright, therefore, was on track when he identified El outright with the Latin Saturnus. We did not, therefore, misspeak when, on an earlier page, we pointed out that, according to the ancients, it was the planet Saturn that was really the god of the Jews. When the Old Testament itself, as we have seen, declares El to have been the \"God of Israel,\" it is the same as saying that Saturn was that god. And, in fact, is this not additionally borne out by the very name Israel which, as we have pointed out, incorporates the theophoric name of El who was Saturn? Thus, incidentally, when J. Glen Taylor, on Biblical and archaeological evidence, was forced to conclude that it was the \"sun\" that was worshipped in the Jerusalem Temple by the Kings of Judah, we can be certain that the \"sun\" in question was the Saturnian one.",

        "content": "As William Warren asked: \"Why this singular enumeration of three of the points of the compass, and this omission of the fourth [that is, the North]?\" Is it not, as T. K. Cheyne surmised, because a \"peculiar sanctity is attached to the North in the Old Testament records\"? And does this not then mean that Elohim's exaltation can only come from the north? Does this not, in itself, also mean that Elohim resided in the north? And if Elohim, as we have seen, was identified by the ancients themselves as Saturn, would it not also mean that Saturn's locus was in the north? As Warren continues: \"A curious trace of the same conception appears in the book of Job...\" Here Warren is referring to that specific incident in which Job, while lamenting the bitter deal that fate had dealt him, complains that he has looked for Eloah but could not find him: \"Behold, I look forward [or 'in front'], but he is not there; and backward [or 'behind'], but I cannot perceive him. On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him. He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.\" Here, the Hebrew word translated \"forward\" or \"in front\" is gedem or gedmah which, among other things, means \"eastward.\" As is to be expected, 'achor, the Hebrew word translated as \"backward\" or \"behind\" also means \"westward.\" Semo'l, translated \"left,\" also means \"north.\" While yamin, that is \"right,\" also means \"south.\" Job's words, above, should therefore read: \"Behold, I look eastward, but he [i.e., Eloah] is not there; and westward, but I cannot perceive him. To the north, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him. He hideth himself in the south, that I cannot see him.\" The designations \"in front,\" \"behind,\" \"left hand,\" and \"right hand,\" for \"east,\" \"west,\" \"north,\" and \"south,\" came into common use among the Semites much later when the Sun—that is the present Sun—had replaced the Saturnian one. Because of other factors which do not here concern us, orientation was indicated by facing east in which the Sun rose. Thus the east was in front, the west was behind, the north was at one's left hand, and the south on one's right. But here, now, as Warren noted, is the odd thing about the manner in which Job's lament is worded. While lodging his grievance that nowhere—east, west, north, or south—could he find Eloah, he made a telling distinction concerning the north. The left hand, that is the north, is described as the place \"where he [that is Eloah] doth work.\" So that, again, we find that it was precisely in the north that Eloah, the same as Elohim/El/Saturn, was believed to accomplish his handiwork. It is, therefore, somewhat ironical that the left hand, the place where the god's goodly deeds were accomplished, became synonymous with bad luck. Although now obsolete, the",

        "content": "Very term \"left hand\" used to mean \"unfavorable\" and/or \"unlucky.\" Moreover, the Latin word for \"left,\" which is sinister, in English came to mean \"evil.\" As I intend to show in a future work, this is because the god of mankind was not always benign. THE SACRED QUARTER The northern locus of the god of Israel is also referred to in the Book of Ezekiel. When Elohim was said to have revealed himself to the prophet Ezekiel, as described in the very first chapters of that book, he is said to have appeared from the north. It was for this very reason that, when the High Priest of Israel officiated at the altar in both the Tabernacle and, later, in the Jerusalem temple, he was obliged to face north. In fact, this priestly ritual of facing north while officiating was practiced by the prelates of other ancient nations, among them the priests of the Haranite Sabians. As A. Fornander noted: \"The Hawaiian soothsayer, or kilo-kilo, turned always to the North when observing the heavens for signs or omens...The ancient Hindus turned also to the North for divining purposes, and so did the Iranians before the schism...so did the Greeks, and so did the Scandinavians before their conversion to Christianity.\" This northernism, meanwhile, must not be understood in a terrestrial sense, but, rather, in a celestial one. This is brought out by the fact that the circumpolar stars were alluded to as Kokkabe 'El (the \"stars of El\"). The throne of El was considered to be \"the pole of the universe.\" Given all of the above, El (Eloah/Elohim) could only have resided in the north celestial pole. As Warren observed: \"The Pole, the unmoving centre-point of the heavens directly overhead, would naturally have seemed to be the top of the world, the true heaven, the changeless seat of the supreme, all-ruling God. And if, accordingly, through all the long lifetime of the ante-diluvian world, the circumpolar sky was to human thought the true abode of God, the oldest post-diluvian peoples, though scattered down the sides of the globe half or two thirds the distance to the equator, could not easily have forgotten that at the centre and true top of the rotating sky was the throne of its great Creator, and that there, in the far North, was 'the sacred quarter' of the world.\" And: \"The religions of all ancient nations signally confirm and satisfy this antecedent expectation. With a marvelous unanimity they associate the abode of the supreme God with the North Pole, 'the centre of heaven,' or with the celestial space immediately surrounding it.\"",
