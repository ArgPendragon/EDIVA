        "content": "Shadow one might expect from illumination by the Sun.” At the same time, Thornhill was suggesting something quite similar. As Talbott reported: “I should mention here that, according to Wal Thornhill, it is possible that in the more electrically active phases the entire configuration may have moved within a [plasma] discharge sheath—something that would not preclude general illumination by the Sun, but could have kept the illumination diffuse.” In his own work, that same year, Thornhill described the “[Saturnian] planetary group” as having been “inside a gigantic cometary coma.” Three years later, Thornhill restated his conviction when he wrote that, in his opinion, Earth orbited in the anode dark space beneath the chromosphere of the brown dwarf that was proto-Saturn. “Earth situated inside the spherical envelope of such a star radiating according to the usual inverse square law, would find the energy influx almost equal over the entire planet. Such an arrangement is far more benign toward life than at present where the energy source, the Sun, subtends a small angle in the sky.” Brown dwarf stars, to which we had compared both Saturn and Jupiter in an earlier chapter, had by then been discovered in quantity. In our neighborhood alone, it has been stated, there may be more brown dwarfs than Sun-like stars. Some of these have been calculated to be one-tenth the size of the Sun with a temperature rising no more than 950° K. In answer to the question whether living entities, including man, would have been able to breathe the constituents of Saturn’s brown dwarf atmosphere, Thornhill replied with the words: “We are [presently] nestled in the Sun’s atmosphere without it causing us any problems. Proto-Saturn’s envelope would have been more dense but still a good approximate to a vacuum. The constituents of the atmosphere of brown dwarf stars, so far as they have been determined, seem to include water molecules and others helpful to life.” What did Thornhill mean by stating that we are presently nestled within the Sun’s atmosphere? As Gary Zank plainly puts it: “We’re surrounded by hot gas.” And whence this gas? Zank explains: “As our sun moves through extremely ‘empty’ or low-density interstellar space, the solar wind produces a protective bubble—the heliosphere around our solar system, which allows life to flourish on Earth...Without the heliosphere, neutral hydrogen would interact with our atmosphere, possibly producing catastrophic climate changes.",

        "content": "While our exposure to deadly cosmic radiation in the form of very high-energy cosmic rays would increase.” What, then, is the Sun’s heliosphere? As already noted, astrophysicists now believe that 99.9 percent of the Universe is made up of plasma. Cometary tails are also now known to be composed of plasma. But, more than that, the Solar System itself is encased in a magnetic bubble, known as the heliosphere, that contracts and expands “like a colossal jellyfish.” Although the existence of the heliosphere had already been known, Pioneer 10 revealed that the bubble is much larger than it had been predicted. Its edge is now believed to lie somewhere between 5 and 10 billion miles from the Sun. It is this heliosphere—this “breathing bubble” as it is now being called—that acts as a “cocoon” which “allows life to flourish on earth.” What all this amounts to is that Earth resides within the Sun’s heliosphere, just as Ashton and Thornhill suppose it once resided in proto-Saturn’s plasma sheath, a hypothesis that can no longer be dismissed as far-fetched. As Thornhill explained further: “The astronomer [William] Herschel believed that people inhabited the Sun beneath its shining clouds. We now know that is a crazy idea. But would it be so crazy if the Sun were a brown dwarf star? To a close observer, proto-Saturn would have looked like a dim red star. Red giants have immense, very low density envelopes. If Betelgeuse were to replace the Sun, it would encompass all of the planets out as far as Jupiter! Astronomers accept the idea that planets could orbit within the thin envelope of such stars.” “Another interesting consequence is that all objects orbiting in that region would receive the same energy per unit area of their surface. The spectrum of the light would have been much redder than at present...” True, as already noted, Earth’s primordial star would have been feebler than our present Sun, but this would have been compensated for by Earth’s proximity to proto-Saturn which would have involved a stretch that was much shorter than its present distance from the Sun, to say nothing of the redder spectrum of light in which it would have been bathed. But could Saturn’s plasmasphere have existed within the Sun’s heliosphere which is itself nothing but a plasmasphere? Can a plasmasphere exist within another? As already noted, our world itself is now being spoken of as being in a “near-Earth plasma environment.” What does this mean?",

        "content": "It was in 1962, due to Mariner 2, that the interplanetary medium was found not to be a near-vacuum as previously believed. Instead, this medium was found to consist of plasma. But, even then, the full implication of this discovery was not immediately understood. As Ralph Juergens, writing in 1972, noted: “One of the primary characteristics of a plasma has up to now received little or no attention from astronomers. This is its ability to shield itself from the electric field of any body in contact with it, or contained within it, and charged to an electric potential different from that of the plasma itself. The mechanism by which such shielding is accomplished was named the space-charge sheath by those who first studied the phenomenon.” And: “By the same sort of analysis, I would conclude that the earth has a potential not quite in keeping with its space environment, and that it therefore is surrounded by a space charge sheath. For the same reasons that a comet’s sheath is elongated away from the sun, I would suppose that the earth’s sheath has a tail; in other words, I would equate the terrestrial sheath with the earth’s so-called magnetosphere.” So, also, Wallace Thornhill who, during one of the question periods at the Society for Interdisciplinary Studies’ Silver Jubilee in September 1999, made reference to “Earth’s windsock-like envelope” usually referred to as its “magnetotail.” As he there pointed out: “In Juergens’ view it is a plasma sheath...” By the turn of the century, astrophysic
