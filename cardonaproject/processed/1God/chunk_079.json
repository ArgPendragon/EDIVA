        "content": "The Solar eclipse during which the shadow of the Moon (M) sweeps over the surface of Earth (E). The eclipse is total within the umbra (darkly shaded region), but partial within the penumbra (lightly shaded region). The conical shape of this lunar shadow, which we can show diagrammatically as seen from space, is not visible to terrestrial eyes. Besides, even had it been, it does not remain stationary. And it does not whirl. Moreover, the immediate body atop its cone is the Moon, concerning which the myth of the axis mundi has nothing to offer. Only a “sun” is sometimes mentioned as having been on top of it. To present this invisible shadow as the prototype of the axis mundi, a pillar which was believed to have supported a “sun” and/or heaven itself, is not only to impose “a law of physics” on the primitive mind, it also goes against the grain of everything that ancient man has stated about it. THE POLE OF THE ECLIPTIC In Hamilet’s Mill, de Santillana and von Dechend analyzed some of the most obscure motifs in all of mythology and came up with a cosmic interpretation even though they hamstrung themselves by disallowing any conclusion that threatened to trespass uniformitarian precepts. Although not the subject of the present volume, the mytho-historical record is full of allusions to cosmic catastrophes which caused terrestrial cataclysms on a colossal scale. We find there records of unprecedented floods, massive earthquakes, the shifting of entire mountains, in concert with the displacement of celestial bodies and a rain of fire from the sky. What de Santillana and von Dechend proposed in the above mentioned work is that ancient man derived these beliefs from the slow displacement of the pole star through the precession of the equinoxes over the millennia (refer back to page 102, this work). Cosmic catastrophism was explained as the dissolution of an order brought about by this slow change in the celestial sphere. Creation consisted in the establishment of a new celestial order.",

        "content": "era ended every time the reigning pole star was displaced; the “selection” of a new pole star through precession was the beginning of a new world age. It has, however, long been understood that most of mythology derives from primitive times, from those eras preceding the birth of writing. It is therefore difficult to accept that the primitive mind of ages past had already noted the extremely slow change of the pole, let alone that the change was understood. De Santillana and von Dechend were, of course, quite aware of this objection, so it is not surprising that they attempted to overrule it. As noted earlier, the discovery of the precession of the equinoxes has long been attributed to Hipparchus, one of the greatest astronomers and mathematicians of antiquity, who flourished sometime between 146 and 127 B.C. Yet—or so the authors of Hamlet’s Mill argued—this does not prove that the phenomenon had not been observed prior to his time. Unfortunately, other than that their theory demands it, this premise is not warranted by the record and the authors in question must therefore stand accused of reading into that record what is not really there. What is worse is that even were we to grant that the phenomenon had been known since primitive times, it remains difficult to accept that this extremely slow change, the perception of which requires thousands of years, could have given rise to a world-wide belief in the cataclysmic end of all things—with flood and fire and the shaking of the terrestrial globe itself—as these authors maintain. After all, when one pole star is displaced by another, no disaster ensues, either in heaven or here on Earth. More important is the fact—and the authors in question were well aware of this—that certain items of myth and ancient astronomical lore not only refuse to fit the precessional scheme of the equinoxes but, as we have seen, are notorious in not fitting anything else that we presently witness in our Solar System. With the vast amount of research that went into their work, they were bound to run headlong into the ancient notion that the planet Saturn had once played the role of pole star. Not knowing what to do with this datum, they ended up relegating it to the limbo of unacceptable data. All this has been brought up here because, needless to say, the authors in question were also bound to run headlong into what they themselves termed the polar axis. So how did they attempt to fit this entity into their precessional scheme? Somewhat ambiguously, they tell us that: “The rotation of the polar axis must not be disjointed from the great circles which shift along with it in heaven. The framework is thought of as all one with the axis.” As they explain on an earlier page, the axis mundi should be understood as “the equinoctial colure which ‘accompanies’ the slowly turning, wholly abstract and invisible axis along the surface of the sphere.” By this they meant the imaginary line running from Earth’s geographical pole to the pole of the ecliptic, the centre around which Earth’s axis revolves once every 26,000 years—in other words, the imaginary pole around which the precession of the equinoxes takes place. What is highly interesting is that even they found this somewhat hard to swallow. As they tell us: “The abstract idea of a simple earth axis, so natural today, was by no means so logical to the ancients...” That being so, why is it we find so many allusions to this pole in the mythologies of all races and in such varied dress? Why would a “wholly abstract and invisible axis,” like Suhr’s",

        "content": "invisible lunar shadow, have obsessed the minds of our primitive forefathers? Why would such an entity have been thought of as a pillar upholding the sky, visualized inter alia as the god’s single leg or his erect penis? Why, indeed, unless it was something that was actually seen? But what was it that our ancestors saw? What was it that could have looked like a pillar supporting the sky? THE WHIRLING RAY FROM ABOVE As we have seen, the Egyptian Shu was described as light personified, which light acted as a prop of the sky. Osiris/Saturn was lauded as having occupied a position above the leg of heaven, which leg was described as a “leg of fire.” The Christian Sibyllines called the pillar of the sky a “pillar of glory.” We have seen that the rendering of the Egyptian Khu and/or khut, the heaven-sustaining column, utilizes a hieroglyphic character which translates as “vertical streamers of light ascending the world axis.” Through Sanskrit, we have even ascertained that this imperishable pivot, or post, was thought of as a fiery axis. The message seems clear enough: Although the direction of the light was interpreted differently by different peoples—i.e., ascending or descending—what the ancients purport to have seen was exactly what Hippolytus described as “the downward flow of light from above” and as “a ray coming from above.” Even Plato had reason to describe it as “a straight light like a pillar” which has been understood as “stretching along the axis of the cosmos,” while others have presented it as “a cylinder of aetherial fire surrounding the axis.” In other words, the phenomenon can be stated to have been a ray of fiery light which stretched all the way from the proto-Saturnian planet to Earth’s geographical north pole, a pillar of light which appeared to support heaven and/or the proto-planetary orb of Saturn above it. But why a wind? What was there in this pillar of light that lent itself analogously to a wind, even a whirlwind no less? At this point one is bound to think of our posited circumstellar or placental cloud which, as we have seen in an earlier chapter, was inter alia described as a fog or foam which “moved round and round continually,” a whirling “primeval void,” a chaos which “heaved” and “turned” in darkness, the “eternally revolving” Tao of the Chinese, remembered by the Dogon as the spinning and dancing Amma, whirling around while organizing the “world” out of chaos, and/or the Norse Aesir who established their seat on the “whirl-field.” Does this not, in fact, accord well with Sanchoniathon’s “breeze of thick air,” to say nothing of Ehecatl’s identity as the “wheel of the winds,” illustrated so graphically by the interior design of a sliced conch shell which served as his symbol? Might it not therefore be that the analogous conception of the axis mundi as a whirlwind derived from its physical association with the whirling placental cloud in question? It is possible that the whirling placental cloud could have added to the analogy of the axis as a whirlwind but, for one thing, the circumstellar cloud would have appeared as a nebular disk around proto-Saturn, and not as a fiery pillar supporting that orb. For another, as we have also documented, ancient accounts seem to leave no doubt that the axis itself was seen to whirl—and so has it been understood by past mythologists regardless of their blundering attempts in interpreting it. We shall have much more to say concerning the axis mundi and its destructive whirling antics as it evolved through time in future volumes, but enough has been said here to make the point.",

        "content": "Chapter 22 Cosmic Genesis THE NATURE OF THE BEAST In the beginning, as I slowly reconstructed the Saturnian model and its attendant scenario, nothing perplexed me more than this effulgent ray of light stretching between our humble abode and Saturn’s glorious realm. Right from day one, David Talbott had understood it as a luminescent stream of falling debris. One reason I could not accept this interpretation came from the lack of recognizable cosmic material in Earth’s Arctic regions. Let’s face it, if the polar column was really composed of material ejected from a stationary planet located in Earth’s north celestial pole, and since the column is posited to have existed for possible millennia, such constant bombardment should have strewn Earth’s Arctic regions with cosmic detritus. Since then, however, such material has been found in Arctic regions. Thus, for instance, “a large fall of iron meteorites” is now believed to have occurred in northwestern Greenland and the adjacent east coast of Ellesmere Island “at some undetermined time in the past.” It is now apparent that this cosmic iron “was discovered by the late Dorset people during the few centuries immediately preceding A.D. 1000, and small pieces of meteoric iron are found on Dorset sites of this period.” The meteoric iron from northwestern Greenland “spread [through trade] at least as far west as Bathurst Island and Little Cornwallis Island and south to the northern part of Hudson’s Bay.” Even so, this is hardly the amount of cosmic material one expects to discover in Arctic regions, especially the area in and around the pole, if the debris had been raining down for millennia. Granted that no one has yet conducted a deliberate search for such material, not enough has yet come to light from this area to satisfy Talbott’s interpretation. Lynn Rose, on the other hand, compared the cosmic pillar to the flux tube which stretches between Jupiter and its satellite, Io. This is a stream of electrons—a 5 million amp, 400,000 volt current, which translates into 2 trillion watts of energy—that flows in a wide arc from both Jupiter’s poles to Io’s. And, to be sure, I had toyed with this idea myself. But I soon discarded it because, while instrumentally detectable, and even photographable through exotic light, Io’s flux tube is not optically visible. Meanwhile, Frederic Jueneman saw this axis as a colossal Rankine vortex, a cosmic tornado of planetary proportions, composed mainly of air and water vapor. Although his model",
