        "content": "since time immemorial, has never however been doubted. Unfortunately, the ancient tales were written down in their present form by early Christian monks who saw fit to turn the ancient gods into men of flesh and blood. Such was Balor, he of the single flaming eye, whose name is ultimately derived from bhel, and thus equivalent to Beli or Bel. He who once had been a celestial divinity was turned into a terrestrial king. Despite this metamorphosis, even though the idea has not been widely accepted, the characteristics of Balor have been compared to those of the Sun.” That Balor, however, had been a nocturnal sun is indicated by his title. He was known as the King of Night. ® THE GOD OF SATURDAY NIGHT As befitted his nocturnal station, Osiris was venerated in a festival which took place at night. “Herodotus tells us that the grave of Osiris was at Sais in Lower Egypt, and that there was a lake there upon which the sufferings of the god were displayed as a mystery by night. This commemoration of the divine passion was held once a year...and an image of a cow, made of gilt with a golden sun between its horns, was carried out of the chamber in which it stood the rest of the year...A great feature of the festival was the nocturnal illumination. People fastened rows of oil-lamps to the outside of their houses, and the lamps burned all night long. The custom was not confined to Sais, but was observed throughout the whole of Egypt.” Another celebration connected with Osiris was the Sed festival which has been claimed to be the oldest Egyptian feast of which we yet retain a trace. James Frazer has suggested that the ritual, which is known to have been celebrated until the end of the Roman period, was as old as Egypt itself. This particular event was held every thirty years—which makes it significant since thirty years is the period of Saturn’s revolution around the Sun. As Frazer himself states, this correlation of the Sed festival with the planet’s revolution has been noticed, and commented upon, by several scholars before him. Since then, the subject has been approached again by de Santillana and von Dechend, although here the authors present Ptah, rather than Osiris, as the “inventor” of the festival, even though they themselves identify Ptah as “the Egyptian Saturn.”* The Sed, of course, was a royal jubilee festival which the pharaoh held after having reigned thirty years. Lucky was the pharaoh who could celebrate two such jubilees. Nor was this custom unique to Egypt. The Persian Shahs, who traced their lineage from the towering figures of the mythical kings—Kai Kubad, Kai Ka’us, and Kai Khusrau—also celebrated their royal jubilee after having reigned thirty years—a fact that did not escape the attention of de Santillana and von Dechend.* Meanwhile, a curious tale comes our way through Apuleius who tells us that, when being initiated into the mysteries of Isis, wife of Osiris, a certain Lucius was given “to see the sun\"",

Another nocturnal feast, as brought to my attention by Roger Ashton, is also held in some parts of India when the thirteenth day of a lunar fortnight happens to fall on a Saturday. In Sanskrit, the day of Saturday is called Shanivar which, Shani being Saturn, translates as “Saturn’s Day.” Actually, Saturday was the day held sacred to Saturn among more than one ancient nation and, to this day, it continues to bear the planet’s name not only in Sanskrit. To the Jews, Saturday is Shabbath (the Sabbath), which word is sometimes said to derive from the closely related shabath, which means “to repose” or “to rest.” In fact, however, the Sabbath is named in honor of Saturn which, in Hebrew, is called Shabtai.” The word shabath—“to repose” —is then traceable to the same root, derived because Elohim was said to have rested from creation on that day.* In Italian, Saturday is rendered Sabato, derived from Hebrew through the Greek Sabbaton. In Maltese, Saturday is called Sibt, derived from the same Semitic root. The English name Saturday is itself a contraction of the Saxon Saterne’s Day (or Daeg) from the Latin Saturni Dies. Even in Indo-China, and more specifically Cambodia, Saturday is named in honor of Prah Sau, which is the planet Saturn.” Now while it is true that not every ceremony that is celebrated on a Saturday has to be Saturnian in character and/or origin, the Indian ceremony mentioned above is itself called Shani Pradosh.® Since pradosh means “night,” the festival in question is translatable as “Saturn’s Night.” A ceremony called Saturn’s Night held in the evening of Saturn’s Day is not just any ceremony conducted on a Saturday; it is obviously one conducted in honor of Saturn. Thus it was that, among other things, Saturn became known as the Lord of the Sabbath,” a belief which finds a curious echo in Persian cosmogony. As Al-Biruni, an Arabian scholar of the 11th century A.D., tells us: “On the 6th day of Farwardin, the day Khurdadh, is the great Nauroz, for the Persians a feast of great importance. On this day—they say—God finished the creation, for it is the last of the six days...On this day God created Saturn...”* The pre-Islamic feast of Nauroz—or Naw Ruz, as it is sometimes transliterated—continues to be celebrated unto this day on the eve of the Persian New Year which traditionally takes place on the first day of spring. It continues to be celebrated not only in Iran (i.e. ancient Persia) but everywhere that Iranians, Afghanis, Kashmiris, Kurds, and Zoroastrians (i.e. Parsis)",

And yet how many of these celebrants have an inkling that what they are really celebrating originated as a Saturnian festival? Of added interest is the fact that, like other festivals of its kind, the feast of Nauroz is celebrated at night; the festivities commence the minute the Sun goes down. Of course it will be pointed out that, being a New Year’s Eve festival, its celebration at night would be logical. In fact, whether celebrated as New Year festivals or not, there is really nothing strange about the fact that Saturnian festivals were conducted at night. After all, in today’s skies, it is at night that Saturn shines, as so it must have shone in ancient times. But, we ask, as a sun? If we are to believe our ancient forefathers, it seems that such was the case. Even if one should disregard all this and assume, against all logic, that such an astronomical fantasy would have, through diffusion, been dispersed around the ancient world and accepted as a truth, how can one explain the migration of this idea across the waters of the Atlantic? For, according to Eric Thompson, even in Mesoamerica do we encounter this persistent belief in a night sun. At this point we can add Hypothesis #2 to the effect that, still according to the ancients, the primeval Saturnian sun shone during that time we today call the night. The question that should now be asked is: Is it possible that the planet we know as Saturn could have once radiated as a sun? Or what does astronomy and/or astrophysics have to offer concerning such a possibility?",

        "content": "Chapter 5 DARK STARS As late as 1966, most theories still pictured the planet Jupiter as consisting of a large inner core of ice under enormous pressure. This core was believed to be surrounded by a voluminous ocean of compressed and liquefied gases which, in turn, merged into an atmosphere of hydrogen. It was “known” that the planet could not be emitting heat from its own internal source. With a core of ice, obviously, this would have been impossible. Thermocouple measurements had in fact detected a very low temperature in the region of -130 to -155°C!. As with Jupiter, so with Saturn. Temperatures on Saturn were estimated as being extremely low, approximately -150°C.2 What an embarrassing difference from the picture that emerged less than a year later! Of course, as usual, there was no consensus among astronomers and some were painting pictures of a Jupiter with a much hotter interior. F. R. Moulton, for example, was speaking of Jupiter’s internal heat as early as 1910.3 It will not be found stated in current scientific literature, but Immanuel Velikovsky was alluding to both Jupiter and Saturn as “dark stars” by 1950.4 This was not based on the scenario of his book, Worlds in Collision, in which the statement appeared, but on earlier events presented in a prequel to that work, which prequel remains unpublished to this day.5 It is not that I uphold either of Velikovsky’s scenarios; I do not. But I am not about to throw the baby out with the bath water. Credit should be given where due. In any case, Velikovsky was not alone. By 1962, E. J. Opik had calculated that Jupiter radiated from 1.2 to 2.0 times the energy it receives from the Sun.® As Ralph Juergens pointed out: “Indeed, speculation that Jupiter is a dying star, radiating away internal heat, goes back more than a century.”” POTTED STARS In 1967, Val Axel Firsoff brought to the attention of astronomers, of whom he was one, the reality of the deep convective atmosphere of these planets. He stressed the fact that, in such an environment, temperatures tend to decline upwards at a steady rate. With the known composition of such atmospheres, this steady rate could be determined. He thus calculated",

        "content": "that if Jupiter’s atmosphere was 300 miles deep, the temperature at its base should be in the region of 1800°C. This would be akin to the surface temperature of cool stars.8 “Indeed,” wrote Firsoff, “Jupiter does emit microwave radiations corresponding to such temperatures.” Allowing for some thermonuclear reactions to proceed at a slow rate in their central regions, and shielded as they are by their vast opaque and cold atmospheres, Firsoff assumed that stellar temperatures could easily obtain inside the Jovian planets. As he concluded: “They would thus be in the nature of ‘potted stars’.”9 By then, even the renowned Gerald Kuiper was referring to Jupiter as a star and the Sun-Jupiter system as a binary. !° FAILED STARS December 3, 1973 is a historical date in the annals of astronomy. On that day, Pioneer 10 passed within 81,000 miles of Jupiter. Exactly a year later, Pioneer 11 skimmed within 27,000 miles of the planet’s south polar region. The new data that these two space probes relayed to Earth sent astronomers and astrophysicists scurrying back to their slide rules and calculations. Observations in the infrared had already indicated that Jupiter was much brighter than would be the case had it merely been a planet reflecting light. D. A. Allen noted that, at 5 mu, Jupiter appeared so bright that it must be radiating more energy than it could absorb from the Sun.!! “When the long wavelength data are also included,” wrote Allen, “we find that Jupiter radiates nearly three times the energy it receives.” !2 As if he had been the only one or the first, D. McNally, who was then with the University of London Observatory, suggested the idea that Jupiter may be more like a star than a planet.!3 John A. Simpson, then professor of physics at the University of Chicago, described Jupiter as “nature’s best gift of what a poor man’s star is like.”!4 What the data from the Pioneer probes had disclosed was that Jupiter is a fast rotating mass of liquid hydrogen. Its convective weather seems to be driven by what physicists began to call its “primordial internal heat.” As time went by, more astronomers began to talk about Jupiter’s “starlike properties” and its similarities to a “mini-solar system.” 15 “But Jupiter is definitely not a star,” Henry Simmons stated and added that, although the planet’s core may reach as much as 30,000°C, its temperature is “hundreds of times too low to ignite the thermonuclear reactions that heat the stars.”® These giant planets, Arielle Emmet echoed him, “could not heat up enough to begin deuterium burning.” !7 Firsoff did not quite agree. He stated that even the lowest assumed temperature of Jupiter’s interior is adequate to initiate nuclear fusion. With deuterium, which has been discovered in the Jovian atmosphere, a reaction can start at 50,000°C. Lithium and beryllium burning would soon follow. “This could raise the central temperature to 1,000,000°C, required for the proton-proton reaction, which is the main source of power in the Sun.” !8",
