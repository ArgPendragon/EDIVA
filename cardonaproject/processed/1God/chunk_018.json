        "content": "of the equinoxes—which term, incidentally, was coined by Hipparchus himself—could not have been discovered without comparing the longitudes of stars at different epochs, sufficiently distant.” Hipparchus’ reliance on much older stellar longitudes is therefore beyond doubt. The prize for the cognition of what lies behind precession, however, remains his. This is not to say that others have not vied for the fame—even if in retrospect and through modern proxy. None of these attempts have, however, withstood the test of scrutiny. THE CRIME OF ANAXAGORAS Anaxagoras (500-428 B.C.) was the first to clearly state that the Moon shines with the reflected light from the Sun, from which he devised a theory concerning the phases of the Moon. At the time, as with Galileo much later, this doctrine, which was not in keeping with the prejudices of the day, was so dangerous that the manuscript in which Anaxagoras set out these theories had to be circulated in secrecy. A century later, Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), a great mind in some matters, not so in others, was to argue that the Moon exhibited phases and that eclipses occurred simply because that was the nature of Earth’s satellite—which, as Sagan succinctly put it, was “an explanation that explains nothing.” Anaxagoras also believed that the Sun and the stars were hot. While this was evident for the Sun, it was not, as it still is not, for the stars. When asked why we do not feel the heat of the stars, he replied correctly that it was because they were too far away. When he calculated the Sun to be larger than the Peloponnesus, which constitutes about a third of Greece, his estimate was thought to be “excessive and absurd.” He knew that the Moon harbored mountains (although he also believed it harbored life). In the end, again much like Galileo, Anaxagoras was charged, convicted, and imprisoned for impiety, mainly because he had taught that the Moon consisted of ordinary, and not divine, matter. It took Pericles, the great Athenian leader, to engineer Anaxagoras’ release from prison. SHADOWS THROUGH SPACE Thales, who lived toward the end of the 7th century B.C., has been lauded by his own ancient countrymen as having been the first astronomer. Diogenes Laertius stated that Thales was first to receive the name of sage; that he was first to study astronomy and predict eclipses of the Sun and fix the solstices; was first to make a number of specific observations relating to the Sun and the Moon; was said to have “discovered” the seasons and to have divided the year into 365 days." According to others, he was also the first, rather than the above mentioned Anaxagoras, to realize that the Moon was actually illuminated by the Sun. Thales is also said to have recognized and to have predicted the solstices; to have been the first to discover the passage of the Sun from one solstice to another; and to realize that this cycle was not always of equal length, but that, on the contrary, there were “slight variations in length of the solar seasons as divided by solstices and equinoxes.”",

        "content": "But, despite William Mullen’s noble attempt to uphold this lofty position for him, the best that can be claimed for Thales is the honor of having been the first Greek astronomer. That being the case, one should attempt to find out exactly how much Thales could have borrowed from the earlier Babylonians. There has been much debate on how much Thales owes his fame to those who later praised his name. D. R. Dicks, for one, has insisted that Thales' reputation in having been the first Greek astronomer comes from later, unreliable, sources, and that, therefore, no validity should be applied to these claims. * Those who have sought to devalue Thales’ reputation have also questioned his ability to predict eclipses. Both Plutarch and Pliny (A.D. 23-79) knew that lunar eclipses were caused by the projection of Earth’s shadow on the lunar surface. The passage of the Moon across the face of the Sun during a solar eclipse would have been more evident, so that it would also have been known that the Moon cast its shadow on earth during such an occurrence.” Even so, knowing what causes a lunar, or solar, eclipse is one thing; being able to predict either of them is quite another. Meanwhile, quite a number of ancient sources, including Herodotus, have claimed that Thales predicted an eclipse which took place during the battle between the Medes under Cyaxares and the Lydians under Alyattes.\"” This has led historians to set the date of that battle at 585 B.C. Benny Peiser, on the other hand, has claimed that “Thales could not have possessed the knowledge necessary to predict eclipses in general.”” In this, he might not have been entirely correct. As van der Waerden had earlier noted: “Such a feat requires the experience of more than forty years, no matter how one proceeds. It is not possible to accomplish it alone. But Thales had no Greek predecessors. The conclusion is inescapable that he must have drawn upon the experience of Oriental astronomers.” Besides, when it comes to the eclipse that is said to have occurred at the time of the battle between the Medes and the Lydians, a close look at what Herodotus reported tells us that, while Thales did predict the year of this eclipse, he said nothing concerning the actual date, the time of day, or the place from which it would have been visible. As various scholars have noted, knowledge and a correct understanding of eclipse cycles should have enabled Thales to predict the eclipse in question by the day, and not just the year.” In his attempt to retain, or regain, Thales’ reputation, Mullen has noted that none of the scholarly arguments denying Thales the capacity to predict eclipses and other celestial occurrences “is sufficient to prove that Thales did not begin an inquiry into each of these phenom-",

Thus I mention all this specifically to stem the possible accusation that I have taken every statement of the ancients as being necessarily true. THE METONIC CYCLE The reconciliation of the motions of the Sun with those of the Moon was required by ancient societies in an endeavor to pin-point their seasonal festivals. Most Greek festivals were held at full moon with certain ceremonies to be held in certain months. The months, therefore, needed to be reconciled with the year. But since twelve lunations fall somewhat short of the solar year, an extra month had to be added to the year every so often. According to Geminos of Rhodes, who wrote sometime in the first century B.C., such a system of intercalation was already in use “some time before the second half of the fifth century B.C.” The earliest such intercalation by the Greeks that has come down to us involved the supplementing of 96 lunar months through an 8-year period, a cycle they called octaeteris, with the addition of leap years every third, fifth, and eighth years by inserting an extra month into each of them.” By the fifth century B.C., however, it had been realized that this 8-year cycle was not all that accurate. The small difference between 99 months (the 96 plus the 3 of the leap years) and the 8 years into which they tried to fit them accumulated as the years went by so that the integration of the solar and lunar motions was thrown off balance. It was the Athenian astronomer Meton who then realized that the Moon returned to the same position in relation to the Sun every 19 years—or so Geminos had it stated, for which reason the system has, to this day, been called the Metonic cycle. This cycle works better than the 8-year one because 19 years equal 235 lunations almost exactly. In actual fact, however, there are indications that the Babylonians had been using this 19-year cycle some one hundred years earlier. The Chinese also seem to have known about it, although it cannot be ascertained just how early the relationship was discovered and/or borrowed. Known as the chang, dates separated by multiples of 19 years are known from inscriptions on Shang dynasty oracle bones. Diodorus Siculus also quoted a no-longer extant work by Hecateus of Abdera who also mentioned this 19-year return of the Moon and that it was known to the Hyperboreans who inhabited an island “not smaller than Sicily” which was located “opposite to the coast of Celtic Gaul,” which could only have been Britain.” In Tibet, the year is counted as 360 days with the addition of seven intercalary months over a 19-year interval set up to keep the phases of the Moon in step with the solar year and the seasons.” It is not known, however, how old this system is. A MATTER OF GRAVITY Isaac Newton owes his prestige in the world of science to his theory of gravity as propounded in his Principia. But, as Velikovsky was right in asking: “Did not Newton read in",
