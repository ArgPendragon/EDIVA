I will not comment on the validity, or otherwise, of Hall’s particular scenario. I merely note that, regardless of the mechanism proposed by Hall, what he described is precisely what later happened to Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. Enter Wallace Thornhill, who proposed just such an analogy. To begin with, like Hall and Talbott, Thornhill also believed that Earth originally orbited Saturn equatorially. And like Hall, he believed that this earlier system was stretched into its co-axial formation only upon entering the Sun’s domain of influence. Granted, as already noted, the Shoemaker-Levy 9 event was a transient one. But according to Thornhill, so too was the axial-coupled Saturnian system. To quote him: “We have seen graphically how an assemblage of orbiting bodies can become strung out in a line with the recent dismemberment of Comet Shoemaker-Levy [9] by the influence of Jupiter. That model takes care of the polar Saturn configuration (which I consider to have been short-lived but spectacular).” “The break-up of the components of [Shoemaker-Levy 9] under the influence of Jupiter may provide an object lesson for the formation of the Saturnian polar configuration, as compellingly reconstructed from ancient sources.” Unlike Hall, however, Thornhill did not see Jupiter as the cause of the Saturnian system’s dismemberment. Instead, he credited our present solar primary “as Saturn’s gravitational sphere of influence shrank on approach to the Sun.” As he explained: “The polar configuration seems to have been a spectacular transitory arrangement between the break-up of the original Saturnian stellar system” and its capture “by our current Sun.” “It therefore seems that the spectacular Saturnian polar configuration...was created when its planetary system was disrupted by the Sun in a manner similar to that when Jupiter disrupted comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 into a ‘string of pearls.’ Such an arrangement is unstable and, therefore, transitory.” “Once inside the heliosphere, proto-Saturn would have exchanged charge with the solar wind at an ever-increasing rate as the charge density increased radially toward the Sun. This, I think, would explain why the linear formation was maintained.",

                    "content": "Long journey to the inner Solar System. It was a dynamic equilibrium maintained by proto-Saturn’s linear acceleration. How short-lived was this transitory system? Thornhill would not vouch for “thousands of years,” but “maybe only a few centuries.” Accepting Talbott’s postulate that “Saturn seems to have wandered in the sky before assuming a fixed polar station,” he presented two possibilities for this errant motion. As he himself stated: “This could mean either that the pre-existing polar configuration was disturbed or that Saturn's [satellite was] dislodged from [its] phase-locked Saturnian equatorial [orbit] by the increasing influence of the Sun...and moved into the polar configuration.” Faced with that choice, Thornhill opted for “the second option” as being “more likely.” Four years later, however, Thornhill had reason to revise his valuation of the co-axial system’s time span. As he stated during an interview: “When it comes to estimating the duration of the polar configuration, the best that can be done is to look at the relative velocities of nearby stars. If we take, for the sake of argument, that the relative radial velocity between proto-Saturn and the Sun averaged 10 kilometers per second, it would have taken proto-Saturn about 45 years to cover the 15 billion kilometers to the inner Solar System.” However, he also added that this forty-five-year period was “merely an order-of-magnitude calculation.” As he said: “It could have taken much longer, but I don’t think it likely to have been much shorter.” Thornhill’s minimum forty-five-year period was better than Spedicato and Del Popolo’s maximum of three months for the duration of the Saturnian co-axial system but, when other parameters are taken into account, not by much. To begin with, Thornhill’s interviewer found reason to comment: “The one thing that bothers me in all this are those 45 years. Okay—so you say it could have been much longer. Unless I am mistaken, however, I doubt that you would be thinking in hundreds, let alone thousands, of years. And yet, Saturn’s linear formation left such an indelible wound on the human psyche—leading to the birth of religion, complete with human sacrifice, the scars of which remain with us till the present—that it is difficult to believe this was the result of a short transient event. Would 45 years—at best a person’s lifetime—or even a hundred, account for the universal mass of mythological material we have at our disposal concerning the event in question? Would it have been enough to scar humanity for the rest of its existence on Earth?",

                    "content": "The best I can do at present is make an estimate based on the best guess of the extent of the heliosphere and the relative speeds of nearby objects. Meanwhile, the celestial effects as viewed from Earth would have been so dramatic that it seems to have completely overshadowed even the growing appearance of the Sun as it loomed closer. I’m not able to say how long it would have taken for the Saturnian configuration to have had the lasting influence it has had on the human psyche. I have tried to visualize the apparition in the sky, and I think it would have been psychologically overwhelming and disturbing. I imagine that all it would have taken would have been one generation of exposure to that sky for it all to become imprinted on mankind. To say the least, this was not a satisfactory answer. As Jueneman, in agreement with Thornhill’s interviewer, noted, “the idea of a 45-year-long excursion into the inner Solar System wouldn’t begin to impress mythological engrams on the psyche of the human survivors.” In reply, Thornhill did hedge a little. “There are too many unknowns at present,” he wrote, “to pin down the duration of the polar configuration to 50 years, 100 years, or 200 years.” But would even 200 years have been enough for the permanent scarring of the human race? My main objection to such a short length of time during which the Saturnian system sustained itself in axial alignment, however, has more to do with the paleontological evidence than with the time required for such engraphic impressions. As detailed in a previous chapter of this work, this state of affairs stretched back into the remote past, possibly as far as the Cretaceous Period, definitely as far as the Paleocene Epoch of the Tertiary Period. And even if one were to grant a reduction in time of these geological ages, there is no way in which they could be reduced to a mere 200 years. Even Thornhill would balk at that. There is, however, one possible way in which Thornhill’s scenario could accommodate the paleontological data, so I present the last tentative scenario before driving home. I do this not to play the role of devil’s advocate, but in an endeavor to leave no possible solution unaccounted for. An original Saturnian system with Earth in a phase-locked equatorial orbit around it, as Hall and Thornhill hypothesize, would satisfy the message of the mytho-historical record as well as the paleontological data if the present terrestrial north polar region faced Saturn. Under this condition, Saturn would have still appeared stationary in Earth’s north celestial pole, providing Earth with the required north polar temperature demanded by the southward radiation of fauna and flora from the Arctic region. Earth’s original axis of rotation would thus have passed through points in the present equatorial latitude. At this point, one might even ask: Why not adopt this system—which is basically Rose’s model with some modifications—and leave it at that? Would this not be more believable than having Saturn and Earth sharing the same axis of rotation? The problem with this is that, in a change from a phase-locked system in equatorial orbit to a later co-axial formation, Earth would have had to undergo a series of drastic changes. Its gravitational lock would have had to be broken only to be re-installed in an entirely different mode; its orbital speed would have had to come to a halt; its axis of rotation would have had to shift by 90°; and its rotational speed would have had to increase. To all this must be added the acquisition of an equatorial bulge due to the increase in Earth’s rotational speed.",

                    "content": "One of these changes on its own would have entailed catastrophic destruction on Earth, regardless of the speed with which they occurred. Acting in concert, abrupt or otherwise, these changes would have resulted in an even more colossal upheaval, the gravity of which would boggle the mind. They even belittle Ashton’s previously mentioned gargantuan cataclysms, making it doubtful that life would have survived on Earth. It is not that catastrophic signs are absent from Earth’s geological strata somewhere near the Age of Saturn, but, regardless of their extension, these nowhere show signs of the dimensions demanded by the totality of the aforementioned terrestrial changes. And then, when all is said and done, why bother with this proposed change from one type of system to another when, as seen from Earth, nothing would have appeared to change in the celestial sphere? After all, as seen from Earth, Saturn would have ended up motionless in the north celestial sphere just as it would have been prior to the change from the earlier system to the later one. Besides, what is there in the mytho-historical record that can be interpreted in favor of such a change? Talbott is of the opinion that “the earliest remembered condition was that of phase lock.” What led him to this? As we have also indicated, still according to Talbott, a phase-locked Saturnian system is “the best explanation for the initial MOTIONLESSNESS or INACTIVITY of Atum-Ra,” and that this initial inactivity “seems to suggest the motionlessness you would get from a phase lock of a satellite to its primary.” But unless I have badly missed something, there is nothing in the mytho-historical record that differentiates between an earlier type of Saturnian inactivity or “motionlessness” and a later but different sort of “motionlessness” or inactivity. All that the record proclaims is that Saturn and/or its anthropomorphic deity was motionless and/or inactive in Earth’s north celestial pole. No change is indicated. In his own objections to Talbott’s postulate concerning the placement of Jupiter behind Saturn, Thornhill had declared: “The principle of parsimony of hypotheses suggests that we don’t introduce another massive body into the system if there are no reports of it during the transition of the proto-Saturn system from a primordial configuration into a polar configuration.” Would it not, then, be just as parsimonious in not introducing a different Saturnian system, since no indications of it can be inferred from the human record? Would not this be in harmony with the scientific principle of Occam’s razor, which specifies that entities and events must not be needlessly multiplied? What, then, of Talbott’s insistence concerning the previous wandering of Saturn prior to its eventual stationary establishment in Earth’s north celestial sphere? As Talbott himself well knows, this constituted a postulate which I had contested for long. In the end, however, due to continuing research, I finally ended up accepting it. Not only had I been looking in the wrong place, but due to some sort of blind spot, I had even misconstrued some of the clearest messages. As it turned out, and as it had been apparent to Talbott from the start, the message of the human record, in this case, turns out to be unequivocal. What, then, to make of this event? Actually, Thornhill had already supplied the answer himself—but he disregarded it. As already noted, when faced with the postulate of Saturn’s early wandering, he presented two possible scenarios to account for it. “This could mean either that the pre-existing polar configuration was disturbed,” he wrote, “or that Saturn’s [satellite was] dislodged from [its] phase-locked Saturnian equatorial [orbit] by the increasing influence of the Sun...and moved into the polar configuration.” While he opted for the second proposition as being the “more likely,” it is the first proposal that best fits the scheme.",

The Saturnian system’s entry into the Sun’s domain, however, was a prolonged development that unfolded in a series of awe-inspiring events. For a while of relative short duration, Earth teetered slightly off balance, and it was during this precarious episode that Saturn was seen to slowly circle around its former stationary spot. The god wandered for a time. But Saturn was soon to reassert its hold upon its satellite and the deity returned to his former motionless locale. There is, of course, much that went on before this temporary interlude, and even more that followed it—but the detailed account of all that, complete with the relative evidence, will have to wait for the proposed sequel to this work. Through all this we have not been able to lay down our dragon’s ugly head—because, if the mechanics behind the break-up of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 are not the ones we seek in explaining the manner in which the Saturnian system could have maintained its axial coupling, we are simply back to where we had started at the beginning of this chapter. What Shoemaker-Levy 9 taught us is that linear formations can exist, but only for a short period. That is not what we seek. What is required is a means to keep such a formation linearly aligned for a much longer period—longer than 3 months, longer than 45 years, 100 years, or 200 years. We need to discover a means to keep Saturn and Earth axially coupled for thousands of years, if not even longer. What, then, is the answer?",

As Eric Lerner explains: “In Alfvén’s theory, a galaxy spinning in the magnetic field of space acts as a huge generator, inducing electric currents in the interstellar plasma. The currents flow in great filamentary spirals toward the center of the galaxy, where they turn and flow upwards along the spin axis.” It is this model, according to Alfvén, which accounts for the violent jets that are observed erupting from the center of galaxies. “Every now and then [says Alfvén], the electric current in a galaxy short-circuits and dumps a vast amount of energy into the core. The galaxy ‘blows a fuse,’ and the blast propels a jet of plasma up the spin axis.” Most astrophysicists, on the other hand, claim that these jets are due to the intense gravity of a black hole harboring at the center of these galaxies, even though the existence of black holes themselves has recently raised some serious doubts. But when it comes to similar jets expelled by a breed of new stars, to say nothing of the remains of supernovae, the black hole explanation becomes untenable. The Crab Nebula is the remains of just such a star which went supernova in 1054 A.D. The explosion blazed so brightly that it was visible from Earth in broad daylight. Plasma jets similar to the ones seen ejecting from galaxies, to say nothing of a ring of hot plasma, have recently been revealed by X-ray photography around the “inner workings” of the Crab. The plasma ring itself has been calculated to be 200 times wider than the Solar System. This ring is believed to be “powered by particles shooting along the star’s magnetic poles,” which create the twin jets that are seen “firing out perpendicularly to the ring.” An identical situation has been found in the Vela supernova remnant. The same is true of young stars, which are now believed to form from gas and dust which “clump” at the center of “an envelope of material” surrounded by “a swirling disk.” Magnetic forces then “direct jets along the axis.” Actually, even our own Sun is now posited to have exhibited such bi-polar outflows, to say nothing of a so-called accretion disk, a remnant of which remains to this day as a circumsolar ring of asteroidal dust.",

At least visually, the item in question bore such an uncanny similarity to my proposed model of the proto-Saturnian brown dwarf star that I believed it important enough to share with the other attendees. Unfortunately, all those present who were interested in the co-axial Saturnian system brushed it aside as irrelevant. Worse still, Arp himself declared the item a mistaken interpretation. It was only during my following correspondence with Arp that I realized he had mistaken my new star for something entirely different. What I had passed around for consideration was a picture of the star designated as HD 163296. What Arp mistook it for was the controversial runaway planet—if that is what it is—that had been discovered streaming away from the double star system known as TMR-1 by Susan Terebey. Once this confusion was straightened out, Arp reminded me that he himself had included two photographs of a star emitting jets in his 1998 iconoclastic work on redshifts. Both photographs show the linear polar jet expelled by “a young stellar object.” What is of more importance, however, is that, very much like the jets from HD 163296, a number of globular clusters, sometimes referred to as “knots,” which are astronomical bodies in their own right, are embedded in the star’s jet. These jet formations are known as Herbig-Haro objects—thus designated HH—named after their discoverers, George Herbig and Guillermo Haro.

The photograph and graphic reconstruction of HD 163296 that I had initially offered for consideration included three of these globular clusters—labeled HH 409-A, B, and C—embedded in the star’s bipolar plasma jets. (The jet itself is labeled HH 409.) HH 34 has at least five of these globular clusters all lined up in a row along the star’s polar jet. The tell-tale “accretion disk” is also shown encircling HD 163296. Here, then, was incontestable evidence—nay, proof—that axially aligned linear formations were not only possible but actually existed in space. They line up along plasma jets ejected poleward, sharing the same axis of rotation as their parent star, exactly as has been posited for Earth and Saturn in this study. Nor can it be said that these configurations are in any way transitory, as in the case of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, since they are believed to exist for millions of years—and thus Arp’s caveat re the “very long time” needed for their formation. Moreover, rather than being uniquely rare cases, Herbig-Haro objects occur in profusion. As of 1994, as many as 250 of such objects had been discovered, and more keep being added to the list. Now if these stars can line up as much as five bodies in co-axial alignment, what is so impossible about proto-Saturn having had one such body—Earth—similarly aligned? Moreover, as those who are already familiar with the Saturn thesis know, and as I intend to show in future sequels, Proto-Saturn eventually ended up having at least three planetary bodies co-axially aligned. Thus, whatever keeps the bodies in Herbig-Haro jets axially aligned would also have kept Saturn and Earth (to say nothing of later planets) in similar alignment. What I must stress here is that all this is not to say that the Saturnian system was a Herbig-Haro object; the immense masses and distances of which alone would preclude such an identity. What is being hypothesized is that the Saturnian system can be visualized to have been a scaled-down version of such an “object,” concerning which more will be revealed in our final chapter.
