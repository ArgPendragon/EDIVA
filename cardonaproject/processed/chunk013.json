                    "content": "Relevant to astronomical science, even today every study on comets is based on a collation of the available historical data. In fact, specialists of the theory of comets give particular importance to the Chinese historical records, which began to be scrutinized for these purposes in the age of Newton. Edmund Halley owes his fame to his supposed discovery of the periodicity of comets. But had not Diodorus Siculus (1st century B.C.) and Pliny (A.D. 23-79) already written about comets returning on their orbits? More than that, according to Diodorus Siculus, the Chaldeans—by whom he meant the Assyro-Babylonians—had already learned to predict the return of comets, as so, also, had the Egyptians. Mary Proctor, however, was not convinced. As she wrote: “For my own part, I reject as altogether improbable the statement of Seneca that the ancient Chaldean astronomers could calculate the return of comets.” The same can be said of the Greeks. Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), however, noted that attention was paid to these phenomena and definite theories propounded concerning them in the Greek schools. It is curious to observe how favorably some of the early hypotheses contrast with the fantastic ideas advanced in later times. The Pythagorians held that comets were permanent bodies belonging to the solar system, revolving around the sun like the planets, but in orbits so extensive that they were visible only when near the earth. As Velikovsky revealed, one of these Greek scholars was Seneca (4 B.C.-A.D. 65): “Seneca [in his De Cometis]...knew the real nature of comets, the inertia of their motion, and their periodicity.

The dogma that comets are apparitions in the atmosphere, like rainbows, was also held by Copernicus. Plutarch even knew that comets whirled or rotated. It is, therefore, something of a pity that Pythagoras himself was of a different opinion, believing comets to be nothing more than mere terrestrial 'exhalations' which rose in the air and ignited the atmosphere. I say it is a pity because, for whatever reason one wishes to believe, Pythagoras turned out to be such a genius that he held the educated world enthralled for close to two thousand years. However, Pythagoras did not entirely obliterate earlier knowledge because, so many years after him, Pliny was still alluding to comets as permanent bodies moving in orbits like the planets and periodically returning on their orbits. And was it not through reading Pliny that Halley managed to gain his fame? Isaac Newton himself disbelieved that comets were physical entities. In an attempt to reconcile his gravitational theory with the precepts of Genesis, he attempted to demonstrate that the Solar System had been created in a single divine act and, obeying divine laws, must remain in stable equilibrium ever since. 11.

The existence of the erratic comets—erratic to the extent that they had not yet been allotted any specific regularity by the astronomers of his time—was very damaging to his thesis, and he therefore spent an awful lot of time and energy in an attempt to explain them. Very much like modern ones, ancient Greek thinkers did not only concern themselves with what they could see, measure, and calculate in the sky but also with what they dared deduce from what they could see, measure, and calculate. Democritus, who lived sometime during the fifth century B.C., one of the founders of the atomic theory, was probably the greatest of the Greek physical philosophers. According to Diogenes Laertius, his works, including treatises on geometry, optics, and astronomy, which unfortunately have not survived, numbered seventy-two. What we know of them comes from numerous quotations preserved in the works of other authors. His views on astronomical bodies were not that divergent from modern ones. Hippolytus thus paraphrased him: '...he [Democritus] maintained worlds to be infinite, varying in bulk; some have neither sun nor moon, while in others those bodies are larger than what we have, and in others more numerous...'",

Giordano Bruno was not as lucky as Anaxagoras. He had no Pericles to save him from those in authority. In A.D. 1600, Bruno was burned alive at the stake by the Catholic Inquisition for espousing the belief, among other things, that other worlds must necessarily harbor other life. The belief that life exists on other planets, however, did not originate with him. As far back as the fourth century B.C., Metrodorus of Chios had already written that: 'To consider the Earth the only populated world in infinite space is as absurd as to assert that in an entire field sown with seed, only one grain will grow.'",

Astronomers of the late Hellenistic and Roman periods were fully conscious that their science drew on earlier 'Chaldean' or 'Babylonian' astronomy; and this fact has never been wholly forgotten. Plato himself acknowledged this Greek debt to Babylonian astronomy, which is perhaps the first such confession to be encountered in Greek literature. Even when it came to such practical instruments as time-telling devices, it seems that the Babylonians long preceded the Greeks. Thus, Herodotus was able to write that: 'The sun-dial and the gnomon with the division of the day into twelve parts, were received by the Greeks from the Babylonians.'",

Epigenes, on the other hand, disagreed with him, stating that in fact, the Chaldeans knew nothing about comets and thought of them as filaments of twisted atmosphere. When it comes to the constellations, we still owe their present names and adopted shapes to the Greeks, but it seems the Greeks themselves had borrowed these from the Babylonians. For instance, the Greeks saw a scorpion in the constellation Scorpio and the Twins in Gemini, just as the Babylonians had before them. Peter James has even indicated 'some specific linguistic borrowing' in this context. For example, the constellation now known as Pegasus in Greek was known as Iku in the Sumerian and Akkadian languages, meaning 'field'. Why then did the Greeks see a horse in this constellation if they had borrowed their lore? This misnomer, according to James, probably stems from the fact that in Greek, 'igo', which sounds like 'iku', meant 'horse.' If this is true, it would suggest that Greek borrowing of Babylonian astronomical knowledge had begun in Mycenaean times.",

The German historian of science, Willy Hartner, has attempted to trace the symbols associated with these constellations farther back in time to the Neolithic people of Elam and Persia. As early as the fourth millennium B.C., these southern Iraqi people were already drawing bulls, lions, and scorpions marked with star symbols. To quote Edwin Krupp, 'Six thousand years ago, the stars of Taurus, Leo, and Scorpius rose heliacally at significant times of the year, as seen from latitude 30 degrees north. This is close to the latitude of Ur, the Sumerian city founded on the Euphrates River five thousand years ago.'",

As Diodorus stated, 'Each of the planets, according to them, has its own particular course, and its velocities and periods of time are subject to change and variation.' They also recognized that the Earth was a sphere and thus counted it among the planets. This is evidenced by Diodorus’ words that the Chaldeans claimed that the moon's light is reflected and its eclipses are due to the shadow of the Earth. Texts that deal strictly with astronomical, as opposed to astrological observations, developed around the middle of the seventh century B.C. during the reign of Nabonassar. From this time to the turn of the millennium, we have a collection of cuneiform tablets referred to as 'astronomical diaries'. These diaries contain records of lunar months, lunar and solar eclipses, and other significant celestial phenomena. The Babylonians were diligent observers and created a catalogue documenting celestial events observed at night, month by month, throughout the year. Many details in these records reflect a sophisticated approach to reconciling celestial motion with numerical measures.",
