                    "content": "THE REVISED HISTORY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nThe discovery of dominant massive planets in extra-solar systems forced astronomers to revise their theories concerning the formation of solar systems in general. Assigning the problem to computers, simulations conducted by Frederic Rasio and Eric Ford resulted in models that were catastrophic enough to warm the hearts of Velikovskians.\n“In a system containing two Jupiter-like planets, the possibility exists that a dynamical instability will develop. Computer simulations suggest that in many cases this instability leads to the ejection of one planet while the other is left in a smaller, eccentric orbit. In extreme cases, the eccentric orbit has a small enough periastron distance that it may circularize at an orbital period as short as a few days through tidal dissipation. This may explain the recently detected Jupiter-mass planets in very tight circular orbits and wider eccentric orbits around nearby stars.”\nIn turn, this led to new theories concerning the formation of our own Solar System. As Josie Glausiusz commented:\n“...the detection of extra-solar planets has forced astronomers to re-examine the theory concerning the formation of our Solar System because these planets present us with a paradox. Many are so monstrous in size, and hug their stars so closely, that they could not have formed in their present positions. The searingly hot stars around which they circle would have melted their rocky cores before they got started. Instead, it’s assumed that they coalesced some distance away, then barreled inward over millions of years. And if such chaos characterizes the birth of extra-solar planets, could not similar disorder have reigned closer to home?  \n“That’s exactly what astronomers are proposing. Instead of staid and steady motion from the start, they see turmoil. During the early years of our solar system, they say, giant planets were born, bounced about, swung past one another, and were flung apart before settling into their present orbits. It is now suggested that the massive icy planets Uranus and Neptune formed in close proximity to gassy Jupiter and Saturn, then barged past the behemoths into the far reaches of the solar system...\n“It is now suggested that the emergence of a Jupiter-sized planet during the early years of a solar system can trigger chaos, birthing punier planets, then ejecting them in all directions.”\nEven newer theories suggest that an alien star could easily pass by the Solar System and that this could alter Jupiter’s orbit, which could then pass so close to Earth that our world could easily be ejected into space or crash into the Sun.\nIn fact, other theorists are now proposing that the early Solar System might have contained up to twenty planets in irregular orbits “where they were eventually bound to collide.”",

G. Hills in 1969 in which it was suggested that the three outermost planets, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, were displaced into their present orbit by encounters with other planets. Described by C. J. Ransom as a consequence of Hill’s analysis of the solar nebula, this theory concluded that Saturn was initially the outermost planet to form in the nebula.\n\nOnce unheard of, it is no longer possible to maintain that our Solar System has remained unchanged since its formation. Granted that astronomers are still keeping such events at arm’s length by insisting that orbital changes within our System could only have transpired millions of years ago, we have reason to believe that some of these changes took place during the era of mankind.",

As Geoffrey Marcy has been reported to have stated: “The claim by David Black is completely incorrect.” Having risen to fame as one of the most successful of extra-solar planet-hunters, Marcy had something to lose if Black was correct. On the other hand, Marcy had a good argument. As he and others have pointed out, four of the companions which Black and his team had investigated are said to orbit their primaries “within one degree of perfect alignment with the line of sight.”\n“Yet the chance of any single partner of a given mass having that orientation is about 1 in 5,000. Conversely, for every partner with that orientation, there should be 5,000 or so with less extreme orientation. No such bodies are seen. Marcy is so convinced that he says Scientific American ‘will be doing science a bum steer’ simply by mentioning Black’s work.”\nBut then, Tsevi Mazeh and Shay Zucker weighed in from Tel Aviv University with the suggestion that “the truth lies somewhere in the middle.” Concerning the four companions investigated by Black, they claim that two of them do indeed “have the heft of a star.” The other two, according to them, do not. Others suspect that the analyses “have fallen prey to subtle computational biases,” and that “it is quite plausible that searchers have unwittingly skewed their sample,” and that higher precision astrometry as well as other methods are needed to resolve the debate.\nEventually, even Marcy was forced to give an inch when the then newly discovered outer companion to yet another star was estimated to be “between 17 and 40 times” the mass of Jupiter. As Marcy was reported to have admitted, “[this one] seems too large for a conventional planet.”\n“*We frankly don’t know what name to give it!’ Marcy said. ‘Is it a planet or brown dwarf...? We simply don’t know’.”\nAs Lemonick phrased it:\n“...maybe astronomers will have to rethink their definition of ‘planet.’ Just because we put heavenly objects into categories doesn’t mean the distinctions are necessarily valid.”",

By then, they were not even sure what a planet really was, let alone red and brown dwarf stars. Alan Stern and Harold Levison attempted to come up with a new criteria, but this did not help much since it was still reliant on mass. Thus, according to them, a planet has to be a body “low enough in mass that at no time, past or present, can it generate energy in its interior due to any self-sustaining fusion reaction.” But, as Adam Burrows pointed out:\n“There is an unfounded prejudice that a planet should not have a thermonuclear phase,” and that this was merely a preconception that might not be verified by observable facts. As far as our thesis is concerned, it does not much matter whether these so-called extra-solar planets are really planets, brown dwarf stars, or some of each, since our scenario accounts for both a planet (Earth) and a brown dwarf star (Saturn) as having been partners outside the Solar System.\n\nTHE RUNAWAY PLANET\nExtra-solar planets were not only found orbiting stars, but even escaping from them. At least one such planet was said to have been discovered streaming away from the double star system known as TMR-1, 450 light-years from Earth, with a separation between them of 3.7 billion miles. Moreover, this one was actually visible through the Hubble Space telescope and has been photographed. Discovered by Susan Terebey, the planet was calculated to be “two to three times Jupiter’s mass, flung off in a gravitational tug-of-war between the [two] stars.” The planet was said to be racing away at a speed of 20,000 miles an hour.\nUnfortunately, this discovery was eventually questioned. The pertinent planet was later explained as nothing more than a background star. This was “deduced” from the spectrum of the object in question which showed no signs of water vapor and appeared to be too hot, at 2,700° Kelvin (4,400° F), to be a protoplanet—even though, personally, I am not quite sure why these parameters should rule out a protoplanet.\nEven so, Terebey herself has not entirely ruled out her original assumption. As a report by her reads: “At this time there is no strong evidence that TMR-1C itself is a protoplanet.” But she added:\n“The models are not yet reliable at such young ages, so this test by itself is not conclusive. The idea remains alive and well that there may be runaway planets and brown dwarfs...which formed via ejection from multiple star systems.”",

LONE TRAVELERS THROUGH SPACE There were other surprises in store. By July of 2000, thirteen extra-solar planets traveling alone through the coldness of space without an accompanying primary—that is without a sun to sustain them—had been spotted by Phil Lucas and Patrick Roche. Their masses have been estimated to be eight times that of Jupiter. Lucas and Roche suspected that “these planets grew directly out of a cloud of cold gas and dust—not from a disk surrounding an infant star, the way normal planets do.” As Lucas himself stated: “We can’t rule out the possibility that some might have been flung out of a solar system, but it looks like they have always been free-floating.”\nAs it happens, the existence of such bodies traveling alone through space had also been predicted by Firsoff thirty-three years earlier when he wrote that: “Although proof is lacking, it seems virtually certain that sunless planets, unattached to stars, do exist.” Proof, it seems, is no longer lacking.",

Using spectrometers, which measure visible and invisible energy alike, Zapatero-Osorio’s team “actually saw the objects they describe.” As with Phil Lucas, and despite her belief that these bodies would have had to have been formed independently, Zapatero-Osorio did not rule out the possibility that they may have been ejected from other systems containing stars around which they would have originally orbited.

THE ABSENT SUN The myths we have so far enumerated may therefore be seen as constituting man’s collective memory of that ancient time when Earth, in the company of its celestial primary, was traveling through the blackness of outer space, far from the Sun, illuminated feebly by Saturn’s meager glow, but basking in the warmth of that primeval giant which was, from time immemorial, the first—and for a while the only—god man knew. Can the mytho-historical record further support this wild contention? Primitive man would not have known that he was living outside our Solar System.

What is of additional interest is that, in a strange sort of way, the absence of the Sun, and its eventual “birth,” continues to be commemorated to the present day in an ancient Peruvian ritual which, in time, gained Catholic overtones. The ritual in question takes place in June high in the Andes where thousands of celebrants congregate from highland villages and towns to participate.
