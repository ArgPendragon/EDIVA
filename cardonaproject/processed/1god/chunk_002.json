            "content": "Chapter 1\nMYTH\nMyths and Legends\nThe first criticism that will be leveled at this work is that it is based on nothing but myths and legends. I agree: it is. It is also based on recent discoveries in astronomy, geology, and palaeontology. Even so, what are myths and legends? Strictly speaking, legends are traditional tales popularly regarded as historical myths. Then what are myths? Myths are usually defined as primitive or ancient tales involving supernatural beings, often embodying once-popular ideas concerning natural and historical phenomena. What, then, is the difference between myths and legends? Some may claim that there is no difference. Others may distinguish between mythic tales told about historical persons (legends) and those told about divine and semi-divine beings (mythology). Personally, I would make a further distinction: mythology deals mostly with cosmogonical origins. In this work, I shall be concentrating on tales dealing with divine and semi-divine beings. I shall claim that these tales are not mythic in the usually understood sense of the word. In other words, I shall argue that the tales I treat are not to be considered untrue. On the contrary, I hope to show beyond a reasonable doubt that these tales truly reflect events that, bizarre though they might seem, actually transpired in ages past. Franz Xavier Kugler, one of the foremost authorities on Babylonian and Biblical astronomy, chronology, and mythology, warned that: \"The first criticism that will be leveled at this work is that it is based on nothing but ancient traditions, even when they are dressed as myth and saga, cannot be dismissed lightly as fantastic, or worse, meaningless fabrications. It is particularly proper to avoid this pitfall when dealing with serious reports, especially those of a religious nature such as those that occur in large numbers in the Old Testament.\" In this work, the word “mythology” is used in its original Greek meaning—mythologia, from muthos or mythos, as pronounced by the Athenians, meaning “tale,” and logia, derived from legein (to speak): that is, the telling of tales. There is nothing in the Greek term itself which specifies that these tales were considered fictional. More than that, it was these very tales that formed the basis of Greek and other religions of the ancient world. True, it might be countered that these ancient religions were based on false premises, but what I aim to indicate is that these premises were anything but false.",

            "content": "One may now ask: What actually constitutes mythos? As Roger Wescott explained, linguistic comparison suggests that the Greek word muthos is derived from a Proto-Indo-European stem which means “to remember nostalgically,” and/or “to pine for.” As I shall also endeavor to show, the contents of the world’s mythology indicate a sorrowful longing for the conditions of a past age. Thus Wescott was inclined to state that he viewed myth “as more wistful than wishful,” besides being “more commemorative than imaginative.” Those familiar with the contents of myth will at once point out that myths can be convoluted in their bewildering messages, when not perplexingly contradictory, to be taken seriously today. But, as Claude Lévi-Strauss admonished, “this apparent arbitrariness is belied by the astounding similarity among myths collected in widely different regions.” Or, as Wescott succinctly phrased it: “Myths are at once startlingly bizarre and oppressively repetitious.” For Alan Watts, the prime paradox was that myth conceals while it simultaneously reveals. RITUAL\nThe systematic study of myth could be said to have been inaugurated no earlier than the 6th century B.C., but it has continued unabated ever since. Myth, in its turn, is inexorably bound to ritual, so much so that a particular school of thought has long argued that myth is derived from ritual. This view holds that myths originated as textual commentaries meant to explain and justify the rites. As James Frazer noted: “No people ever observed a custom because a mythical being was said to have once acted in a certain way.” And as long as the stress is on “mythical being,” I heartily agree. I cannot, however, agree with him when he maintains that “all peoples have invented myths to explain why they observed certain customs”—especially since this begs the question as to why customs arose in the first place. A particular myth, according to Frazer, “is never so graphic and precise in its details as when it is a simple transcript of a ceremony which the author of the myth witnessed with his eyes.” For while many cases can be shown in which a myth has been invented to explain a rite, it would be hard to point to a single case in which a myth has given rise to a rite. Ritual may be the parent of myth, but it can never be its child.",

            "content": "Some may view this as a case of placing the cart before the horse, claiming that the contrary is true: that, in actual fact, ceremonial rituals arose as an attempt to graphically illustrate the events narrated by myth. Wescott, citing Edward Tylor and Lévi-Strauss, definitely saw this reverse as being just as possible—that rites could have arisen as mere dramatizations of preexisting myths. Frazer himself knew this and referred his readers to H. Usener, whose views were in direct opposition to his own. But, as Clyde Kluckhohn was forced to conclude, the problem of which came first, ritual or myth, is one that is not likely to be solved. Thus, while I cannot agree with Frazer’s view, neither can I agree that the opposite is true. I do not believe that myths owe their existence to an author—at least not if we are speaking of the origin of any one particular myth. Myths arose as eye-witness accounts of what was actually seen and, in that sense, no author need be invoked. Likewise, custom, ritual, and religious ceremonies owed their inspiration to actual events which the participants attempted to recreate for more sublime purposes than Frazer ever imagined. My own position is that myth and ritual rose together hand-in-hand in a united effort to perpetuate, rather than explain, what had once taken place in the ancient sky, and to commemorate those events. DRAMA\nIn ancient Greece, myth was not only associated with ritual but also with that form of entertainment that has come down to us as drama. What is interesting about Greek drama, and not widely known, is that the art originated in the rituals dedicated to one particular deity, namely Dionysus. As Gilbert Murray observed, according to the testimony of the Greeks themselves, tragedy was explicitly concerned with the “sufferings of Dionysus.” In fact, when dissatisfied with any particular play, the Athenians were wont to exclaim that “it has nothing to do with Dionysus.” Greek tragedy, strictly speaking, was a peculiar form of art with narrow limits, both local and temporary. It was, in literal meaning, a ‘goat-song,’ i.e., a molpe (dance and song combined), performed at the altar of Dionysus over the sacrifice of a dismembered goat, which, by a form of symbolism common in ancient religion, represented the god himself. Hardly acted outside one small district of Greece, lasting as a living form not much beyond the limits of the fifth century B.C., performed only at one particular type of religious festival, the Dionysia at Athens. True, a certain amount of criticism can be leveled at the above. After all, Dionysus was not himself the usual subject of Greek drama—at least not as we can tell from the various Greek plays that have come down to us—since he only appears in a couple of plays. Various tragic figures, as well as comic ones, served as the basis for Greek theatrical productions.",

            "content": "Greek drama drew on religious, legendary, and historical themes—these formed the moral backbone of Greek society, from which the great dramas were created. This does not mean that Greek drama somehow 'evolved' from religious ritual, though this is commonly supposed. As Peter James pointed out, the real subject of all Greek plays was “good drama—the same criterion used by Shakespeare and the rest.” Of course, the ancient Greeks of the 5th century were much like us—they liked a good drink, a laugh, and good drama. One can argue, as James has, against Murray’s statements concerning the acting out of Greek drama as having taken place hardly “outside one small district of Greece” or that Greek drama lasted as a living form “not much beyond the limits of the fifth century B.C.” since the available evidence seems to contradict him. Thespis, for instance, was renowned for his traveling shows which were usually performed on the back of a wagon. Even so, I cannot agree with James when he claims that Greek drama did not evolve from religious ritual. Murray himself also stated: “We must remember that the subject of Greek tragedy is always the heroic saga. It is never an invented story, and it is never the history of ordinary human beings. I should doubt if there was any named character in an Attic tragedy who was not actually in some way an object of worship: a god or hero or at least the possessor of some taboo, tomb, or oracle, or ritual.” Aeschylus, the Greek poet and playwright, is renowned as the founder of Greek drama. He is one of the three Attic tragedians whose works survive. “The first thing that strikes a student of Aeschylus,” according to Murray, “is the strong Bacchic or Dionysiac element.” Moreover, “the ancient critics seem always to recognize that, while Dionysus was, of course, the patron of all drama, there was something specifically Dionysiac about Aeschylus.” The Greek biographer, Plutarch, noted that all plays written by Aeschylus were “brimming with Dionysus.” Here, an incident in the life of Aeschylus may be pertinent. Apparently, the playwright acted a part in one of his own plays, referencing the goddess Demeter. The audience, who suspected him of revealing the inviolable secrets of one of Demeter’s rites, rose in anger against him. Aeschylus fled, seeking sanctuary at the altar of Dionysus which was erected in the orchestra and thus, at least temporarily, saved himself.",

Murray, of course, is not the only modern authority who holds the view that Greek drama had its origin in Dionysian rituals. According to Karl Kerenyi, “[Friedrich] Nietzsche [also] believed that in line with an unassailable tradition, the oldest forms of Greek tragedy dealt exclusively with the sufferings of Dionysus. For a long time, the sole hero of tragedy was Dionysus.” Like James, Kerenyi did not entirely agree, going as far as labeling Nietzsche’s assertion as false. “The oldest stage hero,” according to Kerenyi, “was an enemy of Dionysus.” But I will not quibble here as to whether it was Dionysus or his enemy who was considered to have been the hero of early Greek tragic drama since this does not alter the fact that such tragedies were originally concerned with the life and downfall of Dionysus himself. Thus, according to Jane Harrison: “The plays were performed in the Theatre of Dionysus, in the precinct of the god; his image was present in the theatre; the chorus danced around his altar; his priest sat in the front and central seat among the spectators. In the face of facts so plain, it seems to me impossible that the drama had its roots elsewhere than in the worship of Dionysus.” Let us, however, temporarily set aside the opinions of modern scholars. What should really concern us is what the ancient Greeks themselves had to say.",
