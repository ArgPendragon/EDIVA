It is also based on recent discoveries in astronomy, geology, and\npalaeontology. Even so, what are myths and legends?\nStrictly speaking, legends are traditional tales popularly regarded as historical myths. But\nthen what are myths? Myths are usually defined as primitive, or ancient, tales involving su-\npernatural beings, often embodying once-popular ideas concerning natural and historical\nphenomena.\nWhat, then, is the difference between myths and legends? There will be some who will\nclaim that there is no difference. Others may make a distinction between mythic tales told\nabout historical persons (legends) and mythic tales told about divine and semi-divine beings\n(mythology). Personally, I would make a further distinction in that mythology deals mostly\nwith cosmogonical origins. But let us not get caught up in semantics. Let me simply say that,\nin this work, I shall be concentrating on those tales dealing with divine and semi-divine\nbeings. One claim I shall, however, be making is that these tales are not mythic in the usually\nunderstood sense of the word. In other words, what I shall be claiming is that the tales I shall\nbe treating of are not to be considered untrue. On the contrary, I hope to show beyond a reas-\nonable doubt that these tales truly reflect events that, bizarre though they might seem, actu-\nally transpired in ages past.\nFranz Xavier Kugler, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on Babylonian and Biblical\nastronomy, chronology, and mythology, who died in 1929, warned that:\nT= first criticism that will be leveled at this work is that it is based on nothing but\n\u201c...ancient traditions, even when they are dressed as myth and saga, cannot be\ndismissed lightly as fantastic, or worse, meaningless fabrications. It is particularly\nproper to avoid this pitfall when dealing with serious reports, especially those of a\nreligious nature such as those that occur in large number in the Old Testament.\u201d'\nIn this work, the word \u201cmythology\u201d is used in its original Greek meaning\u2014 mytholo-\ngia, from muthos or mythos, as pronounced by the Athenians, meaning \u201ctale,\u201d and logia, de-\nrived from legein (to speak): that is, the telling of tales. There is nothing in the Greek term it-\nself which specifies that these tales were considered fictional. More than that, it were these\nvery tales that formed the basis of Greek and other religions of the ancient world. True, it\nshall be countered that these ancient religions were based on false premises. What I aim to\nindicate, on the other hand, is that these premises were anything but false.",

As Roger Wescott explained, lin-\nguistic comparison suggests that the Greek word muthos is derived from a Proto-Indo-Euro-\npean stem which means \u201cto remember nostalgically,\u201d and/or \u201cto pine for.\u201d* And, as I shall\nalso endeavor to show, the contents of the world\u2019s mythology indicates exactly that\u2014a\nsorrowful longing for the conditions of a past age. Thus Wescott was inclined to state that he\nviewed myth \u201cas more wistful than wishful\u201d besides being \u201cmore commemorative than\nimaginative.\u201d?\nThose who are familiar with the contents of myth, even if only cursorily, will at once\npoint out that myths are too convoluted in their bewildering messages, when not perplexingly\ncontradictory, to be taken seriously in this day and age. But, as Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss admon-\nished, \u201cthis apparent arbitrariness is belied by the astounding similarity among myths col-\nlected in widely different regions.\u201d* Or, as Wescott succinctly phrased it: \u201cMyths are at once\nstartlingly bizarre and oppressively repetitious.\u201d* For Alan Watts, the prime paradox was that\nmyth conceals while it simultaneously reveals.\u00b0\nRITUAL\nThe systematic study of myth could be said to have been inaugurated no earlier than the\n6th century B.C.,\u2019 but it has continued unabated ever since. Myth, in its turn, is inexorably\nbound to ritual, so much so that a particular school of thought has long argued that myth is\nderived from ritual.* This view holds that myths originated as textual commentaries meant to\nexplain and justify the rites. As James Frazer noted: \u201cNo people ever observed a custom be-\ncause a mythical being was said to have once acted in a certain way.\u201d\u00b0 And as long as the\nstress is on \u201cmythical being,\u201d | heartily agree. 1 cannot, however, agree with him when he\nmaintains that \u201call peoples have invented myths to explain why they observed certain cus-\ntoms\u201d \u00b0\u2014especially since this begs the question as to why customs arose in the first place. A\nparticular myth, according to Frazer, \u201cis never so graphic and precise in its details as when it\nis a simple transcript of a ceremony which the author of the myth witnessed with his eyes.\u201d\"\n\u201cFor while many cases can be shown in which a myth has been invented to explain a\nrite [Frazer had it stated], it would be hard to point to a single case in which a myth\nhas given rise to a rite. Ritual may be the parent of myth, but can never be its child.\u201d\u201d",

Wescott, citing Edward Tylor\nand L\u00e9vi-Strauss, definitely saw this reverse as being Just as possible\u2014that rites could have\narisen \u201cas mere dramatizations of preexisting myths.\u201d \u201d Frazer himself not only knew this but\nreferred his readers to H. Usener whose views were in direct opposition to his own.\" But, as\nClyde Kluckhohn was forced to conclude, the problem as to which came first, ritual or myth,\nis one that is not likely to be solved.\"\nThus, while I cannot agree with Frazer\u2019s view, neither can I agree that the opposite is\ntrue. To begin with, I do not believe that myths owe their existence to an author\u2014at least not\nif we are speaking of the origin of any one particular myth. Myths, as I intend to illustrate,\narose as eye-witness accounts of what was actually seen and, in that sense, no author need be\ninvoked. Likewise also with custom, ritual, and religious ceremonies: They all owed their in-\nspiration to actual events which the participants attempted to recreate for purposes much\nmore sublime than Frazer ever imagined.\"\nMy own position is that myth and ritual rose together hand-in-hand in a united effort to\nperpetuate, rather than explain, what had once taken place in the ancient sky, and to com-\nmemorate those events.\nDRAMA\nIn ancient Greece, myth was not only associated with ritual but also with that form of\nentertainment that has come down to us as drama. What is interesting about Greek drama,\nand not widely known, is that the art originated in the rituals dedicated to one particular de-\nity, namely Dionysus. As Gilbert Murray observed, according to the testimony of the Greeks\nthemselves, tragedy was explicitly concerned with the \u201csufferings of Dionysus.\u201d In fact,\nwhen dissatisfied with any particular play, the Athenians were wont to exclaim that \u201cit has\nnothing to do with Dionysus.\u201d *\n\u201cGreek tragedy, strictly speaking, was a peculiar form of art with narrow limits, both\nlocal and temporary. It was, in literal meaning, a \u2018goat-song,\u2019 i.e., a molpe (dance and\nsong combined), performed at the altar of Dionysus over the sacrifice of a dismem-\nbered goat, which, by a form of symbolism common in ancient religion, represented\nthe god himself. Hardly acted outside one small district of Greece, lasting as a living\nform not much beyond the limits of the fifth century B.C., performed only at one par-\nticular type of religious festival, the Dionysia at Athens.\u201d\u201d\u201d\nTrue, a certain amount of criticism can be leveled at the above. After all, Dionysus was\nnot himself the usual subject of Greek drama\u2014at least not that we can tell from the various\nGreek plays that have come down to us\u2014since he only appears in a couple of plays.

Thespis, for instance, was\nrenowned for his traveling shows which were usually performed on the back of a wagon.\nEven so, I cannot agree with James when he claims that Greek drama did not evolve from\nreligious ritual.\u201d Murray himself also stated that:\n\u201cWe must remember that the subject of Greek tragedy is always the heroic saga. It is\nnever an invented story, and it is never the history of ordinary human beings. I should\ndoubt if there was any named character in an Attic tragedy who was not actually in\nsome way an object of worship: a god or hero or at least the possessor of some taboo,\ntomb, or oracle, or ritual.\u201d\u201d\nAeschylus, the Greek poet and playwright, is renowned as the founder of Greek drama.\nHe is the first of the only three Attic tragedians of whose work entire plays survive. \u201cThe first\nthing that strikes a student of Aeschylus,\u201d according to Murray, \u201cis the strong Bacchic or\nDionysiac element ... \u201d* More than that: \u201cThe ancient critics seem always to recognize that,\nwhile Dionysus was, of course, the patron of all drama, there was something specifically\nDionysiac about Aeschylus.\u201d\u201d Nor is this merely Murray\u2019s contention. The Greek biogra-\npher, Plutarch, himself had had it stated that all of the plays written by Aeschylus were\n\u201cbrimming with Dionysus.\u201d*\nHere, an incident in the life of Aeschylus may be pertinent. Apparently, the playwright\nhimself once acted a part in one of his own plays in which there was a reference to the god-\ndess Demeter. The audience, who suspected him of revealing the inviolable secrets of one of\nDemeter\u2019s rites, rose in anger against him. Aeschylus fled, seeking sanctuary, to the alter of\nDionysus which was erected in the orchestra and thus, at least temporarily, saved himself",

What should\nreally concern us is what the ancient Greeks themselves had to say, because, after all, it was\nthey who were in the best position to illuminate us on the subject.
