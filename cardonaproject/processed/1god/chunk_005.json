            "content": "This event did not happen long ago; it occurred when the recording of history had reached perfection, allowing events to be immortalized on film. As Greenberg noted, \"The last two choices are definitely in error. Film footage of the great swastika being blown up (as seen in the film The Enigma of the Swastika) leaves no doubt that it was the Zeppelinfeld swastika.\" If memory can be so confused for recent events, why question our memory of more remote events? Without film documentation, how can we be sure of what transpired?\n\nTwo lessons can be gleaned from the above example: Despite differing versions regarding which swastika was destroyed by the invading army, all reports agree that a colossal swastika in Germany was blown up. This core aspect of a historical event must be held onto, much like in the myths that may have been embellished over time. For example, whether Noah took one pair or seven of each animal into his ark, the core remains that he took male and female specimens.\n\nThe second lesson is that various versions of an event can often be compared and, with logic, the truth can usually be ascertained. In the study of mythology, comparative methods can be very effective.\n\nHermann Collitz highlighted that \"Comparative mythology, in cooperation with the study of popular traditions (folklore), has been thoroughly explored. Mythological science does not primarily focus on cultural development, but instead seeks to identify similar ideas across different cultures and attempt to determine types that recur over time.\" In essence, this branch of mythology compares myths from different nations and races, sometimes even comparing divergent myths within the same race or nation.",

            "content": "A tale from Hindu lore concerns Kali, whose thirst for blood developed after she had slain the demon Raktavira (also known as Raktabija). From every drop of blood that fell to the ground, another demon arose, possessing his courage, strength, and valor. To prevent Raktavira's blood from reaching the ground and generating more demons, Kali was forced to drink it as it gushed out. This insatiable thirst for violence eventually led to her needing intervention from Shiva, who had to mingle among the demons she was slaughtering to bring her to her senses.\n\nSimilarly, the goddess Anath in a Ugaritic myth came to Baal’s aid against his enemies, going on a rampage against mankind. In both stories, intervention was required by a male figure to restrain the goddess from annihilating humanity.\n\nWilliam Albright pointed out that Marvin Pope noted many traits that Anath shares with Kali or Durga, suggesting a deeper connection between the respective myths. Additionally, a similar myth when Egypt's Sekhmet, colored with anger by Ra, slaughtered and flooded the world in blood, showcases the commonalities across cultures.",

Furthermore, the Persian work called Bundahish refers to the planet Venus as Anahid, confirming this identification. Anath has been identified as the Babylonian Ishtar, whose identity has never been contested. Michael Astour noted that Anath, the Queen of Heaven, was worshipped as the Morning Star. Therefore, it can be concluded that if Anath is associated with Venus, Kali and Sekhmet may also be seen as personifications of Venus, leading to significant interconnections in comparative mythology.",

He posited that ancient civilizations derived their structures from a common base. The similarity among the myths of Anath, Kali, and Sekhmet may suggest a continuum of knowledge shared through contact between cultures. However, the different names and depictions of these goddesses suggest distinct origins rather than direct borrowing, despite shared themes of destruction.",
