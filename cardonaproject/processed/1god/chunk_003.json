                    "content": "The construction was within the sacred precinct of the god. It should also be noted that the rites of Dionysus so closely resembled those of the Egyptian god Osiris that Herodotus thought it impossible for the Greek rites to have risen independently of the Egyptian ones. He therefore supposed that the Greeks must have borrowed their rites from the Egyptians and, with slight alterations, passed them on as their own. Plutarch also insisted upon the detailed resemblances between the rites of Osiris and those of Dionysus, indicating that comparative mythology is not merely a modern tool as some critics have maintained. In this case, no borrowing need be called for; what is fundamentally present is that whatever Dionysus originally stood for was essentially the same as what Osiris originally represented. In simpler terms, Osiris and Dionysus are representations of the same original phenomenon—simply different national guises of the same god. Others have maintained that the similarity of Greek rituals to those of the Egyptians stems from the Greeks' ignorance of Egyptian practices. Thus, for instance, Gwyn Griffiths argued that Greek observers were 'not usually in a position' to understand Egyptian religion, particularly because of their ignorance of the Egyptian language.",

According to Griffiths, each deviation caused by misunderstanding, whether radical or slight, would have contributed to one more 'remove' from the original version. Ancient Egyptian religion, often denigrated, was respected and understood by individuals such as Eudoxos, who lived with priests and studied Egyptian, fostering a great respect for their culture. Despite criticism of Bernal from mainstream scholars, his assertion that modern mythologists believe they understand the ancients better than the ancients themselves may still hold truth. The main point is not whether tragedy was originally concerned with Dionysiac ritual but whether it truly originated as a direct response to it. Historical reflection suggests that Greek opinion converged on the point that tragedy, derived from the Greek word 'tragodia,' or 'goat song,' evokes the violent death of a god, particularly in its homage to Dionysus.",

Alfred de Grazia noted the potential for trained speakers to memorize extensive works such as Homer's epics over time. The retention and recall of epic narratives, demonstrated through systematic learning methods characteristic of childhood education, confirm the power of oral tradition. Though the hexameter form of Homer's poetry may have roots in oral traditions that aid memorability, it is essential to understand its broader implications on the integrity of oral narratives.",
