Stars are suns.\nIs it not possible that Jupiter and Saturn had once burned as relatively miniature suns and\nthat, through evolutionary or catastrophic processes, they became permanently dimmed?\nThat, at least, seems to have been the final consensus as Jupiter won its place in popular\nbooks on astronomy as a body that was once much hotter. According to Roy Gallant, it\nwould even have glowed:\n“Jupiter, two and a half times as massive as all the other planets combined, began as\nan enormous gas ball that contracted and heated up... But, unlike the Sun, Jupiter had\nfar too little mass to send its core temperature high enough to start fusion reactions.\nInstead of reaching the millions of degrees needed, the core heated up only a few\nthousands of degrees. So Jupiter became only hot enough to glow cherry-red, like a\nred dwarf star, and for a while it bathed its inner moons in light and heat that faded as\nJupiter slowly cooled.”\nMINIATURE SUN\nRichard Hoagland, in his usual recklessness, was more direct. “Jupiter was once a miniature\nsun according to our current concepts of solar system formation,” he was reported as\nsaying. True, he then added: “It only lasted a short time—a few million years at most,”33\nwhich would also mean that it had stopped radiating millions of years ago.\nBy 1981, Saturn was known to radiate from two to three times the energy it receives from\nthe Sun.33 Its estimated internal temperature had by now risen to 20,000 K.34 By then there\nwas no doubt that both Jupiter and Saturn were in possession of internal sources of heat.\nEven so, as Andrew Ingersoll repeated what had been preached ever since the discoveries by\nthe Pioneer and Voyager probes, and in complete disregard of Firsoff’s hypothesis, “neither\nplanet is massive enough for gravitational self-compression to have initiated nuclear fusion.”\nThe final verdict was that “neither planet is a star.”33\nAnd yet, as Ingersoll informed his readers, “James B. Pollack and his colleagues at the\nAmes Research Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have developed models\nof the history of the giant planets and conclude that the interior of Jupiter and\nSaturn is still hot today.”34\nBut then the extra heat was explained away: “Models of the cooling of Jupiter over the\nhistory of the Solar System account for all the power that Jupiter is radiating today in excess\nof the amount it absorbs.”35 When it came to Saturn, however, the models in question fell\nshort.\nFAILED MODEL\nIngersoll himself had to admit that:\n“Similar models fail, however, to account for about a third of the excess that Saturn\ndradiates. Apparently Saturn has a source of internal heat not included in the",

Is it not simply because Sat-\nurn’s total heat emission turned out to be significantly higher than had been predicted from\nmodels of the planet’s cooling history?38 Should not this model, then, have been discarded?\nAfter all, Jupiter’s excess ratio of internal heat over solar input is just about identical to that\nof Saturn.39 One is therefore led to believe that the internal heat of both planets must be due\nto near-identical causes. Or was the source of the internal heat of the two planets variously\ngiven for each of them because no single model could be found to account for both of them?\nAs it turned out, for its size, Saturn was found to be more star-like than Jupiter, emitting\nmore heat than Jupiter, overall being much more active than Jupiter.\nWriting in 1985, Leroy Ellenberger did not quite agree. As he summed the situation up:\n“All of the handwaving about Jupiter and Saturn being ‘failed’ or ‘dark’ stars\nnotwithstanding, the great preponderance of present astronomical thinking, which is\nsupported by detailed computations, indicates that planets are planets and stars are\nstars. That Jupiter and Saturn are failed stars is an obsolete idea.”\nThat was Ellenberger’s scholarly opinion. We, on the other hand, beg to differ.\nBROWN DWARFS\nBy 1983, Jupiter had received a new tag; it was now pigeon-holed as a brown dwarf, the\nnature of which was best explained in layman’s terms by Rick Gore:\n“When a gas cloud along a galaxy’s spiral arm is compressed, it will collapse under\nits own gravity and ignite as a star if the clump has sufficient mass; if less than one-\ntenth the mass of our sun, it may become a ‘brown dwarf.’ Jupiter is such an object,\ntoo small to ‘turn on’ by nuclear fusion but still shedding heat from its collapse.\nBrown dwarfs cannot be seen at great distances but may well account for a large part\nof a galaxy’s mass.”42\nMuch more recently, the touted discovery of extra-solar planets have been given astrophysicists enough headaches. One such headache is that, if their theorizing is all that correct,\nsome of these planets, with masses equal or greater than that of Jupiter, orbit much too close",

As Sam Flamsteed reported:\n“One possible explanation would be that these are not planets at all but brown dwarf\nstars. A brown dwarf is about as close as a star can get to being a planet without actually being one. For one thing, it is small enough to be mistaken for a very large\nplanet, at least from a distance. And since, being small, its core is not put under\nenough pressure for nuclear reactions to take hold, it emits only a dim glow at first\nand then gradually goes dark.”43\n“Theorists have always assumed that brown dwarfs must be at least ten times more\nmassive than Jupiter and probably more. But perhaps they’ve overestimated. Maybe a\nbrown dwarf can be six times as massive as Jupiter or even less.”\nBut, as Flamsteed was shrewd enough to notice:\n“To assume that the theorists are baffled, is to underestimate them badly. A good astronomical theorist never lets the complete absence of information stand in the way of\na nice theory and, conversely, never gets thrown when an actual observation arrives\nto spoil it. Lack of data can actually be an advantage. Unhindered by facts, some\ntheorist is bound to have come up with a model that explains even the strangest\ndiscovery.”45\nIn their attempt to explain the anomalous behaviour of the extra-solar planets that everyone started discovering all over the place, it was even conjectured that there was enough material in these systems “to make planets ten times bigger than Earth.” Objects of such size, it has been theorized, would be in possession of such gravitational fields powerful enough “to act like a gigantic vacuum cleaner.” Such objects tend to suck in “whatever nearby gas is left over.” And the result? “In a mere 10,000 years or so you have Jupiter—a rocky core ten times the size of Earth surrounded by an immense atmosphere 35,000 miles thick.”4”\nApart from Jupiter-sized planets, this hypothesis was later applied to both Jupiter and\nSaturn themselves. “All of which might make one ask: If a Jupiter-sized planet can form in\nan extra-solar system in 10,000 years or so, how can anyone be positively certain that Jupiter\nitself, or for that matter Saturn, did not take a similarly short time to form? And if that is allowed as a possibility, then how can one be positively certain that Jupiter and Saturn are billions of years old?\nEven more was yet to come. After having been so sure they knew just about everything they needed to know about Jupiter, astronomers were in for yet more surprises when Comet\nShoemaker-Levy 9 impacted the planet in July of 1994. In analyzing the aftermath of the\nimpact, they discovered that the planet has far less water than had been expected; the three\npredicted layers of the atmosphere were not detected; strong winds were found to be present\nat all levels of the atmosphere; and the amount of helium turned out to be only half of what\nhad been theorized.",

            "content": "One factor, however, remained unchanged: Excess heat was still found to be escaping\nfrom Jupiter’s deep interior; the planet was still emitting at least twice the amount of energy\nit receives from the Sun.\n\nFinally — one more surprise; but not from any new discovery. This one came from the astrophysicists themselves. While Saturn’s excess heat has been relegated to kinetic energy released by the circulation of dissolved helium, the lack of helium was now being blamed for\nJupiter’s internal warmth.*9\n\nGo figure.\n\nSECOND INTERLUDE\n\nThe last thing I wish to be accused of is that I apply the above information to improper\nuse. So first let me state that, as the references themselves indicate, the information in question comes untampered from purely scientific sources. Nor am I here advocating that either\nJupiter or Saturn could sustain nuclear reactions in their cores. Not even Firsoff dared go that\nfar. But such reactions as Firsoff claimed possible were never specified as having to be, or\nhaving been, sustained. The very nature of the mytho-historical evidence I presented in the\npreceding chapters itself negates this possibility. Obviously, so does the present state of these\ntwo planets. Had such reactions been sustained, Jupiter and Saturn would still be flooding the\nnight with their radiated light. To an extent, even Ellenberger is correct. Jupiter and Saturn do\nfail as stars, but only in their present condition.\n\nAlthough it is my belief, and that of a few others, that Saturn was a true sun—which\nmeans that it radiated its own light rather than having reflected that of the Sun as it does\nnow—it must not be understood that it shone with a continuous blinding light. Ancient\nsources impel us to believe that, although brighter than the Moon at night, Saturn was not as\nbright as the Sun. In fact, as will be indicated in a future work, additional evidence indicates\nthat, during the day, Saturn paled in comparison to the Sun.\n\nIt should also be kept in mind that I am not here attempting to make a case for Saturn\nhaving been highly luminous in historical times, despite the fact that I have cited historical\nsources as evidence. It must be stressed that these sources allude to past events—that is, even\nthough themselves ancient, their allusion is to an even older system. In actual fact, my contention is that Saturn shone as a nocturnal sun in prehistoric times—that is before the age of\nwriting.\n\nThe stretch from prehistoric to historic times is measurable in only a few thousand years\nso that a critic would be absolutely correct in arguing that this does not change the fact that,\nfor both planets in question, their luminous phase is believed to have terminated billions of\nyears ago. While this is the generally accepted view, it can actually be safely stated that\nJupiter is still slightly luminous.%° At Jupiter’s size—and mass—has it not occurred to anyone that something might be wrong with this implied rate of decreasing luminosity had\ndegeneration really commenced billions of years ago? And, by the same token, could not the\nsame be said for its implied rate of cooling?\n\nWhere the presently accepted scientific tenets and the hypothesis presented in this work\ndiffer is precisely in this time factor. And here, as long as one accepts current theory, the hypothesis must falter.\n\nBut is currently accepted theory necessarily correct? How often have we been cocksure of\nmatters which turned out not to be so? Were astrophysicists not, until a few years ago, pitching Jupiter as a cold planet with an icy core? Were they not, at the same time, estimating Saturn’s temperature to be as low as -130°C? Need I burden the reader with a long list of astronomical certainties which have only yesterday, so it seems, turned into myth?!\n\nI am not raking mud as an exercise in scientific embarrassment. I do realize that this is the\nway science is meant to progress—by replacing old “truths” with new and, where possible,\ntheory with fact.\n\nLet not what I am about to state next be misconstrued into a fundamentalist stance. Nothing could be further from the truth. But, in the past, geologists and astronomers have steadily\nincreased the age of Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe surrounding them. Is it accepted that not a single new discovery can ever make them reverse the process?\n\nPersonally, I have no recourse but to admit that the entire hypothesis presented in this\nwork hinges on historical and mytho-historical sources. But before anyone raises the objection that historical sources have no validity where astronomy is concerned, allow me to remind them that the history of astronomical discoveries, as already indicated in a previous\nchapter, rightly commences with such sources.\n\nThe hypothesis that Saturn was once a sun that shone at night did not originate with me.\nOthers have preceded me—and they stretch all the way back to Sumerian times. Lewis\nGreenberg and Warner Sizemore were the first to bring the matter to my attention.*? As we\nhave already seen, Morris Jastrow and R. C. Thompson preceded them. But way back of us\nall there stretches a long line of writers who have left a record of this astronomical belief\nregistered on vellum, papyrus, bark, and clay.\n\nMoreover, the combined evidence that led me and my immediate predecessors to this rediscovery was not culled from mythic sources; it was not based on mythic interpretation.\nGranted that volumes could literally be filled with such complimentary evidence, the fact\nmust be stressed that the original impetus behind this assumption came from what can best be\ndescribed as ancient astronomical assertions.\n\nIn his 1910 paper on the subject, Jastrow attempted to rationalize what to him appeared as\nan impossibility. He could not see what there was in that small pin-point of light we call Saturn that could impel the ancients to allude to it as a sun. As indicated in a previous chapter,\nhis rationalization was a lame one. To repeat what I have already stated—because it does\nbear repetition—anyone could look up and see that Saturn was anything but a sun. Most\npeople, then as now, would not even have been capable of locating Saturn in the night sky.\nBesides, anyone could see that, Saturn or not, there was no such thing as a night sun. That is\nunless it either was so or once had been.\n\nEven so, it would be amiss for me not to point out that ancient astronomical knowledge\ncan be, as will be, complemented by mythology as long as mythic interpretation retains the\nancients’ own original belief. This is something that has not always been adhered to by modern mythologists.\n\nModern mythologists, on the other hand, should not be faulted for their misconceptions\nfor they, too, looked up and the only sun they saw was the one that shines upon us now. Nor\nis this a uniquely modern misconception. The ancient Greeks, who appeared relatively late\non the historical scene, among others, suffered the same confusion. To them, Saturn was the\nsame pin-point of light we see in our own night sky. They could not therefore understand\nwhy some of their ancestors called this planet Helios since, to them, Helios was the Sun.
