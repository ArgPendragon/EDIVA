The phenomena recorded in them are precisely those that are predicted by the mathematical astronomical cuneiform texts of the Hellenistic period [that is, later Greek]. During Seleucid times, when Babylon was ruled by the Hellenistic dynasty founded by Seleucus I after the death of Alexander, a period which is calculated to have lasted from 312 to 64 B.C., lunar and planetary theory had developed along Greek classical lines. Abstract numerical tables, or ephemerides, representing the motions of the heavenly bodies, were much in vogue at the time. These continued to record the recurrence of astronomical phenomena, year by year, “with an accuracy comparable with that of contemporary observations.” Judging by the contents of the astronomical diaries, this accuracy can be stretched to 747 B.C. There is no great wonder in all of this, but it does prove one point, banal as it may seem, and that is this: Beginning from at least the middle of the seventh century B.C., Babylonian astronomers knew very well what these pin-points of light called planets looked like and could easily distinguish one from the other; they knew where every planet belonged in the sky and what track each one of them invariably followed—an easy matter for anyone with a keen eye-sight plus the patience and the motivation to learn. Yes, I know, it is hardly even worth mentioning. Why, then, contrary to what we see above us in the night sky at present, did these same Babylonian astronomers insist that the planet we call Saturn had been the most prominent body in the sky? That is a question the answer to which, beginning in the very next chapter of this work, will carry us into some very strange and deep waters.",

            "content": "Chapter 3\nThe Sun Star\nTHE MOST PROMINENT OF THE PLANETS\nIt was Diodorus Siculus, sometime in the first century B.C., who first reported to the Hellenistic world that the Chaldeans regarded Saturn as the most prominent of the planets:\n“But above all in importance, they [the Chaldeans] say, is the study of the influence of the five stars known as planets...the one named Cronus [the same as Kronos] by the Greeks [i.e., Saturn]...is the most conspicuous...”\nAs viewed from Earth, this is simply not so. Venus is much more prominent. It is easily the brightest of the planets, bright enough at night to cast shadows and, when meteorological conditions permit, bright enough to be seen during the day. In contradistinction, Saturn is a very difficult object to observe. Even Bob Forrest, one of the strongest opponents of cosmic catastrophism, was moved to display his bewilderment at this datum:\n“The only puzzling thing about this passage [of Diodorus] is the way Saturn is said to be the most conspicuous of the planets. All else is fairly routine.”\nAs we shall see, this statement is not the “only puzzling thing” in this passage of Diodorus; nor is all else in it “fairly routine.” But one thing at a time.\nThe term “Chaldean,” meanwhile, has long been misunderstood and misapplied by ancient historians and moderns alike. As used by Diodorus and other classical authors, the term simply meant “astrologers” and/or “astronomers,” but always in relation to the Babylonians.* These, then, were the same Babylonians whose astronomical achievements we have enumerated in the previous section. But how, then, with all of their sophisticated knowledge of the heavens, could they have committed such an error? Or, if an error it was not, why would they have perpetuated such a falsity?\nOf course, one could also ask: Why take the word of Diodorus, a Greek historian, who could easily have been mistaken on matters Babylonian? But was Diodorus the only writer of antiquity who ever reported this strange belief concerning the planet Saturn? And, in fact, were the Babylonians the only ones who were supposed to have asserted this oddity?\nTo give but one other example—and later we shall give others—we note here one of the Sanskrit names of the planet Saturn, that is Grahanayakah.* The name is composed of the words graha(h)—“planet” —and nayakah—“chief or leader.”* Thus, according to this name, Saturn is, or at least was, considered the leader of the planets—in fact, the chief planet.®\n\nAs we shall soon see, this belief was widespread among the ancient nations and it is difficult to believe that such a persistent assertion could have been the result of mere fancy. But if the astronomers of the time could see, as they must have, that Saturn was not the most prominent, or conspicuous, of the planets, on what was the belief based?\n\nSTELLA SOLIS\n\nSo what was it that made the Babylonians allude to Saturn as the most prominent of the planets—prominent enough for them to refer to it, inter alia, as En-Me Sar-ra, that is “Lord of the Law of the Universe”? One must admit, that is quite a lofty title to bestow on what appears to be a mere pin-point of light in the present night sky.\n\nThe clue to Saturn’s prominence—even loftiness—was supplied by Diodorus in the very same passage we have already partly quoted. There, this writer continues to report that “the [planet] named Cronus [i.e. Saturn] by the Greeks...they [the Chaldeans] call the star of Helios...”\n\nIt is somewhat odd that Forrest did not find this statement as “puzzling” as the one which proclaims Saturn to be the most prominent of the planets. Odder still is that he relegated it to the unimportance of “fairly routine” reporting because, to the Greeks of Diodorus’ time, Helios was the Sun. From it are derived such Sun-oriented English words as “heliacal,” “heliocentric,” and “heliograph.” Why would the Babylonians have referred to the planet Saturn as the star of the Sun?\n\nBut what of the Babylonians themselves? Do we not hear from them directly? With so many cuneiform tablets having been lost through the vagaries of nature and the hand of man, and with so many undeciphered others falling apart in museum basements, it would not have been remarkable had this datum not survived in the original. But it has, and in more than one text.\n\nR. C. Thompson might have been the first to discover, even if not entirely understand, this Babylonian verity. Thus, another Babylonian name for the planet Saturn was (Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-US,’ and we find it stated in an astrological report from that nation that “(Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-US Mul (il) Sama Su-u,” which Thompson translated as “[the planet] Saturn is the star of the sun.””\n\nActually, Diodorus should have known that this belief was already common among the scholars of his own nation. Eratosthenes of Alexandria, who thrived somewhere between 276 and 194 B.C., and whose astronomical, mathematical, and geographical knowledge enabled him, as we have already seen, to measure Earth’s circumference, identified the planet Saturn as the star of the Sun, as did several other Greek writers.'' Among the Greeks, this belief continued down to the 6th century A.D. as is known through the neo-Platonic philosopher Simplicius who also called Saturn the star of the Sun.”\n\nWhether they obtained this particular information from the Greeks or not, we find that the Romans were of a similar mind. In his enumeration of the planets, the Latin writer Gaius Tulius Hyginus who, as the superintendent of the Palatine Library, must have had access to much older material, referred to the planet in question as the star of Sol.\" As just about any dictionary will verify, Sol was not only the Roman Sun personified, it was, as it still is, the very Latin word for “Sun.” From it are derived such English words as “solar,” “solarium,” and “solstice.” The scholiast on Germanicus also lists Saturn as Stella Solis'°—Star of the Sun—a name which apparently was a common designation for the planet in Roman times.'°\n\nBut whence the belief? Better still, what does the designation “star of the Sun” really mean? To what does it allude?\n\nA telling clue comes from Sanskrit. In this language, Surya is the common name for the Sun. Suryaputrah, which means “son of the Sun,” is however one of the names for the planet Saturn.” Another Sanskrit name for the Sun is Ravi and, again, we find the planet Saturn designated as Raviputra which also means “son of the Sun.”” As the son of the Sun, Saturn could be termed the star of the Sun. But this only raises another question. Why would Saturn, among the planets, have been thought of as the son of the Sun?\n\nLet us go one step farther. Yet another Sanskrit name for the planet Saturn is Saurah. But saurah also means “solar day” and/or “solar month.” This seems to indicate that the connection between Saturn and the Sun was more intimate than we have so far deduced. In fact, this last datum is enough to make one believe that, at least to the Hindus, Saturn and the Sun were close to being synonymous.\n\n(MUL) LU-BAT SAG-US\n\nA common entry in a collection of astrological reports from Nineveh and Babylon which, in variant forms, is many times repeated, uses the formula “When Shamash [the same as Sama] stands in the halo of Sin” such and such a thing will come to pass.” Now open up just about any work on Assyro-Babylonian mythology and you will find it stated that Shamash and Sin were the deified Sun and Moon. According to this belief, the omen mentioned above would then translate as “when the Sun stands in the halo of the Moon” such and such a thing will come to pass.\n\nNow while the Sun and Moon can be seen together, the Sun can never appear in the halo of the Moon. For one thing, the Sun does not appear small enough to fit between the Moon and its surrounding halo—when it has one; for another, the Moon can only appear within a halo during the night when the Sun, needless to say, is absent. What, then, could the Babylonian astrologers have been alluding to?\n\nBibliography:",

            "content": "NINGIRSU\n\nOther than earlier readings of the name Ninurta as Nin, Ninib, Ninip, etc., the deity in question possessed some bona fide aliases, one of which was Ningirsu*—the Lord of Girsu (in Lagash).© This is ascertained by the Gula Hymn of Bullutsa-rabi in which the consort of the goddess Gula (also known as Bau and/or Nin-Karrak)® is called by various names among other aliases. As a text reveals, Ningirsu was also revered as the war god and planet Saturn. This dual identity underscores the close association between the god and the planet, further emphasizing Saturn's prominent role in ancient astronomy and mythology.\n\nThere is no point in claiming that this was astrological nonsense. Babylonian astrologers, like those of ancient China, were required to acquaint their rulers with the mandates of heaven, to warn them of impending disasters or to soothe their fears with reports of divine satisfaction. The foretold events might not always have come to pass. Fallacious predictions, however, were one thing; impossible ones were quite another. There would have been no point in predicting an event based on an astronomical occurrence that could never have come to pass. A prognostication based on the appearance of the Sun within the halo of the Moon would not only have been useless, it would have been considered utterly insane. No Babylonian astrologer would have risked ridicule, not to mention royal displeasure, by sending such a prediction to his king. Why, then, did they even bother writing down such a formula?\n\nAs Morris Jastrow, even without knowing the full implication of these formulae, concluded: “Since this phenomenon can only occur at night, Sama cannot of course be the sun.”\n\nThis brings us back to the Babylonian statement mentioned earlier which reads “(Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-U8 (il) SamaS Su-u,” and which, as we have seen, Thompson translated as “Saturn is the star of the sun.” Jastrow, however, has noted that while this reading is possible, a more accurate translation would be “Saturn is the sun-star.”” We note here the difference between calling Saturn the star of the Sun—the star belonging to the Sun—and naming it as the Sun-star since the latter seems to connote the Sun itself. In fact, another translation given by Jastrow is “[the] planet Saturn (as a) star is Shamash.” Stated more clearly, what this datum is really telling us is that “the planet Saturn is Shamash”TM or “Shamash is the planet Saturn.”\n\nWhat is also of interest is that this statement appears as a gloss in one of those omens which uses the formula “when Shamash stands in the halo of Sin.”* This not only makes better observational sense, it compliments—nay, validates—the formula which uses Shamash as a name for Saturn.

            "content": "NINGIRSU\n\nOther than earlier readings of the name Ninurta as Nin, Ninib, Ninip, etc., the deity in question possessed some bona fide aliases, one of which was Ningirsu*—the Lord of Girsu (in Lagash).© This is ascertained by the Gula Hymn of Bullutsa-rabi in which the consort of the goddess Gula (also known as Bau and/or Nin-Karrak)® is called by various names among other aliases. As a text reveals, Ningirsu was also revered as the war god and planet Saturn. This dual identity underscores the close association between the god and the planet, further emphasizing Saturn's prominent role in ancient astronomy and mythology.\n\nThere is no point in claiming that this was astrological nonsense. Babylonian astrologers, like those of ancient China, were required to acquaint their rulers with the mandates of heaven, to warn them of impending disasters or to soothe their fears with reports of divine satisfaction. The foretold events might not always have come to pass. Fallacious predictions, however, were one thing; impossible ones were quite another. There would have been no point in predicting an event based on an astronomical occurrence that could never have come to pass. A prognostication based on the appearance of the Sun within the halo of the Moon would not only have been useless, it would have been considered utterly insane. No Babylonian astrologer would have risked ridicule, not to mention royal displeasure, by sending such a prediction to his king. Why, then, did they even bother writing down such a formula?\n\nAs Morris Jastrow, even without knowing the full implication of these formulae, concluded: “Since this phenomenon can only occur at night, Sama cannot of course be the sun.”\n\nThis brings us back to the Babylonian statement mentioned earlier which reads “(Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-U8 (il) SamaS Su-u,” and which, as we have seen, Thompson translated as “Saturn is the star of the sun.” Jastrow, however, has noted that while this reading is possible, a more accurate translation would be “Saturn is the sun-star.”” We note here the difference between calling Saturn the star of the Sun—the star belonging to the Sun—and naming it as the Sun-star since the latter seems to connote the Sun itself. In fact, another translation given by Jastrow is “[the] planet Saturn (as a) star is Shamash.” Stated more clearly, what this datum is really telling us is that “the planet Saturn is Shamash”TM or “Shamash is the planet Saturn.”\n\nWhat is also of interest is that this statement appears as a gloss in one of those omens which uses the formula “when Shamash stands in the halo of Sin.”* This not only makes better observational sense, it compliments—nay, validates—the formula which uses Shamash as a name for Saturn. If conditions permit, the pin-point of light in the night sky that is Saturn can be discerned within the halo of the Moon. (Actually, this argument, which I myself have had reason to repeat in the past,” is not even called for because, as I will indicate in a future work, Sin did not always stand for the Moon.”)\n\nThompson, of course, was aware before Jastrow that the Babylonians called Saturn by the name of Shamash.” Since this verity came to light at least as early as 1900, it is a sin of omission—worse still, a scholarly deception—not to have it so stated in current works dealing with Assyro-Babylonian mythology.
