            "content": "Fragments of a cuneiform tablet, one of various items constituting the Babylonian astronomical diaries (illustration after A. Sachs). The phenomena recorded in them are precisely those that are predicted by the mathematical astronomical cuneiform texts of the Hellenistic period. During Seleucid times, when Babylon was ruled by the Hellenistic dynasty founded by Seleucus I after the death of Alexander, a period calculated to have lasted from 312 to 64 B.C., lunar and planetary theory developed along Greek classical lines. Abstract numerical tables, or ephemerides, representing the motions of the heavenly bodies were much in vogue at the time. These continued to record the recurrence of astronomical phenomena, year by year, with an accuracy comparable to that of contemporary observations. Judging by the contents of the astronomical diaries, this accuracy can be stretched to 747 B.C. There is no great wonder in all this, but it proves one point: Beginning from at least the middle of the seventh century B.C., Babylonian astronomers knew very well what these pin-points of light called planets looked like and could easily distinguish one from the other. They knew where every planet belonged in the sky and what track each one of them invariably followed—an easy matter for anyone with keen eyesight and the motivation to learn. Yes, I know, it is hardly even worth mentioning. Why then, contrary to what we see above us in the night sky at present, did these Babylonian astronomers insist that the planet we call Saturn had been the most prominent body in the sky? That is a question to which the answer will carry us into some very strange and deep waters in the very next chapter of this work.",

            "content": "Chapter 3\nThe Sun Star\nTHE MOST PROMINENT OF THE PLANETS\nIt was Diodorus Siculus, sometime in the first century B.C., who first reported to the Hellenistic world that the Chaldeans regarded Saturn as the most prominent of the planets: \"But above all in importance, they [the Chaldeans] say, is the study of the influence of the five stars known as planets...the one named Cronus [the same as Kronos] by the Greeks [i.e. Saturn]...is the most conspicuous.” As viewed from Earth, this is simply not so. Venus is much more prominent. It is easily the brightest of the planets, bright enough at night to cast shadows and, when meteorological conditions permit, bright enough to be seen during the day. In contradistinction, Saturn is a very difficult object to observe. Even Bob Forrest, one of the strongest opponents of cosmic catastrophism, was moved to display his bewilderment at this datum: “The only puzzling thing about this passage [of Diodorus] is the way Saturn is said to be the most conspicuous of the planets. All else is fairly routine.” As we shall see, this statement is not the “only puzzling thing” in this passage of Diodorus; nor is all else in it “fairly routine.” But one thing at a time. The term “Chaldean,” meanwhile, has long been misunderstood and misapplied by ancient historians and moderns alike. As used by Diodorus and other classical authors, the term simply meant “astrologers” and/or “astronomers,” but always in relation to the Babylonians. These were the same Babylonians whose astronomical achievements we have enumerated in the previous section. But how, then, with all of their sophisticated knowledge of the heavens, could they have committed such an error? Of course, one could also ask: Why take the word of Diodorus, a Greek historian, who could easily have been mistaken on matters Babylonian? But was Diodorus the only writer of antiquity who ever reported this strange belief concerning the planet Saturn? And, in fact, were the Babylonians the only ones who were supposed to have asserted this oddity? To give but one other example—and later we shall give others—we note here one of the Sanskrit names of the planet Saturn—that is Grahanayakah. The name is composed of the words graha(h)—“planet”—and nayakah—“chief or leader.” Thus, according to this name, Saturn is, or at least was, considered the leader of the planets.",

            "content": "So what was it that made the Babylonians allude to Saturn as the most prominent of the planets—prominent enough for them to refer to it, inter alia, as En-Me Sar-ra, that is “Lord of the Law of the Universe”? One must admit, that is quite a lofty title to bestow on what appears to be a mere pin-point of light in the present night sky. The clue to Saturn’s prominence—even loftiness—was supplied by Diodorus in the very same passage we have already partly quoted. There, this writer continues to report that \"the [planet] named Cronus [i.e. Saturn] by the Greeks...they [the Chaldeans] call the star of Helios.” It is somewhat odd that Forrest did not find this statement as “puzzling” as the one which proclaims Saturn to be the most prominent of the planets. Odder still is that he relegated it to the unimportance of “fairly routine” reporting because, to the Greeks of Diodorus’ time, Helios was the Sun. From it are derived such Sun-oriented English words as “heliacal,” “heliocentric,” and “heliograph.” Why would the Babylonians have referred to the planet Saturn as the star of the Sun? But what of the Babylonians themselves? Do we not hear from them directly? With so many cuneiform tablets having been lost through the vagaries of nature and the hand of man, and with so many undeciphered others falling apart in museum basements, it would not have been remarkable had this datum not survived in the original. But it has, and in more than one text. R. C. Thompson might have been the first to discover, even if not entirely understand, this Babylonian verity. Thus, another Babylonian name for the planet Saturn was (Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-US, and we find it stated in an astrological report from that nation that “(Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-US Mul (il) Sama Su-u,” which Thompson translated as “[the planet] Saturn is the star of the sun.” Actually, Diodorus should have known that this belief was already common among the scholars of his own nation. Eratosthenes of Alexandria, who thrived somewhere between 276 and 194 B.C., and whose astronomical, mathematical, and geographical knowledge enabled him, as we have already seen, to measure Earth’s circumference, identified the planet Saturn as the star of the Sun, as did several other Greek writers.",

            "content": "continued down to the 6th century A.D., as is known through the neo-Platonic philosopher Simplicius, who also called Saturn the star of the Sun. Whether they obtained this particular information from the Greeks or not, we find that the Romans were of a similar mind. In his enumeration of the planets, the Latin writer Gaius Tulius Hyginus, who, as the superintendent of the Palatine Library, must have had access to much older material, referred to the planet in question as the star of Sol. As just about any dictionary will verify, Sol was not only the Roman Sun personified, it was, as it still is, the very Latin word for “Sun.” From it are derived such English words as “solar,” “solarium,” and “solstice.” The scholiast on Germanicus also lists Saturn as Stella Solis—Star of the Sun—a name which apparently was a common designation for the planet in Roman times. But whence the belief? Better still, what does the designation “star of the Sun” really mean? To what does it allude? A telling clue comes from Sanskrit. In this language, Surya is the common name for the Sun. Suryaputrah, which means “son of the Sun,” is however one of the names for the planet Saturn. Another Sanskrit name for the Sun is Ravi and, again, we find the planet Saturn designated as Raviputra which also means “son of the Sun.” As the son of the Sun, Saturn could be termed the star of the Sun. But this only raises another question. Why would Saturn, among the planets, have been thought of as the son of the Sun?",

            "content": "There is no point in claiming that this was astrological nonsense. Babylonian astrologers, like those of ancient China, were required to acquaint their rulers with the mandates of heaven, to warn them of impending disasters or to soothe their fears with reports of divine satisfaction. The foretold events might not always have come to pass. Fallacious predictions, however, were one thing; impossible ones were quite another. There would have been no point in predicting an event based on an astronomical occurrence that could never have come to pass. A prognostication based on the appearance of the Sun within the halo of the Moon would not only have been useless, it would have been considered utterly insane. No Babylonian astrologer would have risked ridicule, not to mention royal displeasure, by sending such a prediction to his king. Why then, did they even bother writing down such a formula? As Morris Jastrow, even without knowing the full implications of these formulas, concluded: “Since this phenomenon can only occur at night, Sama cannot of course be the sun.” This brings us back to the Babylonian statement mentioned earlier which reads “(Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-US (il) Sama Su-u,” and which, as we have seen, Thompson translated as “Saturn is the star of the sun.” Jastrow, however, has noted that while this reading is possible, a more accurate translation would be “Saturn is the sun-star.” We note here the difference between calling Saturn the star of the Sun—the star belonging to the Sun—and naming it as the Sun-star since the latter seems to connote the Sun itself. In fact, another translation given by Jastrow is “[the] planet Saturn (as a) star is Shamash.” Stated more clearly, what this datum is really telling us is that “the planet Saturn is Shamash” or “Shamash is the planet Saturn.” What is also of interest is that this statement appears as a gloss in one of those omens which uses the formula “when Shamash stands in the halo of Sin.” This, then, was the astrologers’ way of informing whoever read this particular report that by Shamash the planet Saturn, and not the Sun, was meant. The formula in question should therefore read “when Saturn stands in the halo of Sin” and such and such a thing will come to pass. This is further clarified by another gloss which appears in a number of similar cases which unambiguously declares that (Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-US ina tarbas Sin izzaz—i.e. “Saturn stands in the halo of Sin.” This not only makes better observational sense, it compliments—nay, validates—the formula which uses Shamash as a name for Saturn.",

            "content": "emphasize the role of the Sun, in lieu of Saturn, when the opposite was true. In this case, the gloss was made to indicate “Same u-mi”—i.e. “Sama of the day.” Variants of the name Shamash still mean “sun” in many modern Semitic languages. Thus, in Hebrew, the common word for “sun” is shemesh. Among the Aramaeans, the word was also rendered SemeS (shemesh) or SimSa (shimsha). In pre-Islamic times, the Arabic word was SamSu (Shamshu). Even in Maltese, the only European language with a distinctive Semitic root-base, the Sun is called xemx, where the “x” is phonetically equivalent to “sh”—thus shemsh. All of this raises some very interesting questions. Why, for instance, was the planet Saturn called by the same name as the Sun? It is not as if the Babylonians had no other names for Saturn—we have already encountered two: En-Me Sar-ra and (Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-US. Ancient names, unlike some modern ones, carried their own meanings. No one in those days would have thought of naming a person or an object by using lexical abstraction. Shemesh, and therefore Shamash, means “to be brilliant,” and while this may be an apt name for the Sun, one would hardly think of alluding to the pin-point of light that is Saturn by the same appellation. And yet this is precisely what the Babylonians did. As Jastrow was forced to conclude, “the fact that Saturn was also called the ‘sun’ is vouched for, both by explanatory notes attached to astrological connotations, and by notices in classical writings to that effect.” Thus, while we understand that Shamash was the name of the planet Saturn as well as the Sun, is it also to be understood that Saturn was once believed to have been as brilliant as the Sun?",

It is strange that this consensus was reached, and maintained, in spite of Virolleaud’s contention that ud (and, by extension Akkadian u), actually stands for “sun” or “sun light.” More recently, this subject has again been taken up by Sjoberg and Bergmann who have indicated that “originally u [and, by extension, Sumerian ud] did not mean ‘storm’ but ‘light.’” Thus even “sun” and “sun light” are not entirely correct. The epithets quoted above should therefore read “the most furious light” and “King, Light whose brilliance surpassed (all others—i.e. all other gods).” Thus, originally, Ninurta seems to have had nothing to do with storms and everything to do with light—which is much in keeping with his sun-like qualities. Nimrod has also, and often, been identified as the planet Saturn, even if the reason for the identification has seldom been clarified. When a reason is given, it usually runs something like the following: Nimrod, sometimes called Nebrod, the traditional founder of Babylon, was “the first to become king on earth...and took as title the name of the planet Kronos [which was Saturn].” Nimrod, however, did not have to take the name of the planet Saturn because his name was already that of Saturn. Thus, for instance, Nimrod has also, and often, been claimed to be an alias of Ninurta. The actual truth, however, is that the two names are really one and the same. The cuneiform characters which spell nin, ur, and ta can also be read nim, ru, and ud respectively —which can be said to be the same syllables in reverse and which, of course, spell “nimru-ud,” a name that has been popularized as “Nimrod.” Of course, it is not only in legendary tales, such as those dealing with Nimrod, that Saturn was lauded as king—often the very first king the world had ever known. As we have already seen above, in the original, that is older, sources, Ninurta/Saturn is himself proclaimed lugal—that is “king.” And this, again, is in keeping with the mytho-historical record since all of the Saturnian deities were revered as kings, the first of their line.",

As we noted in Chapter 1 of this work, the cuneiform sign for “god” and “planet” was one and the same. However, the same cuneiform sign also stood for “king.” But, more than that, the very same ideogram was also used to “spell” the name of the great Sumerian god An (or Anu) who—as the father of all the gods, the “Head of the older generation of gods,” standing at the beginning of every theological list from all periods—can also be understood as a personification of the Saturnian deity. More in keeping with our subject, we also find Ninib lauded as “the light of heaven and earth” and, quite explicitly, as “he who, like the sun, the light of the gods, irradiates the nations.” There is, again, no point in claiming that these were metaphorical epithets meant to be applied to the god and not the planet he represented because, to the ancients who venerated him, the god and the planet were one and the same.",
