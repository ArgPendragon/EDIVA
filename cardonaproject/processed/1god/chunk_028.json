                "THE ASTRONOMICAL DILEMMA. Needless to say, our theory also demands an astronomical solution to the problem inherent in Saturn’s polar placement. As already noted, there are no bodies in the present Solar System which are linearly aligned. Worse than that, present Solar System theories, based on purely gravitational forces, do not seem to allow for celestial bodies so aligned. In the past, various authorities have attempted to scientifically account for, or discount, this polar alignment, but, as of this writing, none of them have been able to encompass the totality of the model and/or the entire events dictated by the Saturnian scenario. This is not to be wondered at because the events in question have so far been scattered over an ever-growing array of piece-meal publications without much regard for their chronological order. Worse than that, not all of the events, with all their celestial interactions, and their consequential outcomes, have so far received treatment. Nor can the present work alleviate that particular problem. See here especially, R. Ashton, “The Unworkable Polar Saturn,” AEON 1:3 (May 1988), pp. 39 ff.; F. Hall, “Solar System Studies,” Part 2, AEON 1:4 (July 1988), pp. 25 ff.; R. Driscoll, “The Saturn Myth: A Tentative Physical Model,” in ibid., pp. 50 ff.; R. Grubaugh, “A Proposed Model for the Polar Configuration,” AEON III:3 (October 1993), pp. 39 ff.; V. Slabinski, “A Dynamical Objection to Grubaugh’s Model,” AEON III:6 (December 1994), pp. 1 ff.; B. Grubaugh, “Grubaugh responds,” in ibid., pp. 11 ff.; R. Driscoll, “Magnetic Models of the Polar Configuration,” AEON IV:2 (August 1995), pp. 5 ff.; idem, “Stability and Dimensions of the Polar Configuration,” AEON IV:5 (November 1996), pp. 11 ff.; E. Spedicato, “Numerical Analysis of Planetary Distances in a Polar Model,” AEON V:4 (July 1999), pp. 23 ff.; W. Thornhill, “Stars in an Electric Universe,” AEON V:5 (January 2000), pp. 47 ff.; E.

Actually, the implication derived from the mytho-historical record is that there was a time when not even Saturn was yet quite visible. The record, for instance, hints at a time when the unseen god was still to emerge from an all-encompassing darkness. Mankind continued to remember this as the time of beginnings, a time before Creation commenced. Thus the later compilers of the Rig Veda could philosophically state that, before there were any gods, there was neither “existent” nor “non-existent.” And yet there was something which was described in the same source as “that One Thing” and “this All.” As it is stated: “That One Thing, breathless, breathed by its own nature: apart from it was nothing whatsoever.”\n\n“And: ‘Darkness there was: at first concealed in darkness this All was indiscriminated chaos. All that existed then was void and formless.’”\n\nAs we shall soon see, this all-encompassing darkness is spoken of by the mythologies of almost all races. In fact, this milieu is stressed so often that one cannot help but assume that few situations impressed early man as much as this prolonged environmental state. And yet, in this darkness, up in the sky, there seems to have been something indistinct, the “void and formless” substance of the Rig Veda.\n\nTOHU WA BOHU\n\nAs David Talbott noted from the very inception of his Saturnian studies, man described the creation of what has been termed “the earth” as if he had been an actual witness to it all. He was there when it happened and saw it all unveil with his very own eyes. Some will counter that this was the natural outcome of man’s budding philosophical yearning. Looking around him, we are told, man would eventually have fallen upon the question of how everything had come to be. But, apart from the fact that the doctrine of beginnings was not universally adhered to, why would all those races who believed in Creation have described it in",
