And, in that respect, as much knowledge was lost as was\nrecorded. This we have to keep in mind as we continue with our study, and, while I shall\nnever use it as a crutch, I will have recourse to remind the reader of it from time to time in\nthe pages that follow. As Sharon Begley et al. noted:\n“Before there is knowledge, there must be memory. Yet few subjects remain so\nunknown, so obscured in metaphor and myth. According to the ancient Greeks, life is\nthe act of recollecting knowledge the soul forgot at the moment of its birth in a\nbody... Later thinkers noted the perversity of memories—how nothing imprints them\nmore strongly than the desire to forget.”\nPERPLEXITY\nRoger Wescott recently wrote: “Ever since Greek philosophers first initiated critical\nexamination of Homeric and Hesiodic myth, some mythologists have characterized myths in\ngeneral as mad.”\nAs Wallis Budge stated of Egyptian texts, the perplexity of ancient beliefs confounded\neven those very ancients who professed adherence to them. Speaking especially of the\nantiquity of the so-called Book of the Dead, Budge informed his readers that there is no\ndoubt that “the greater part” of these texts “are far older than the period of...the first\nhistorical king of Egypt.”” According to him: “Certain sections indeed appear to belong to\nan indefinitely remote and primeval time.” Those who came later, however, did not always\nseem to have understood what the originals had alluded to—which is exactly the situation\nthat Thamus, in reproaching Thoth, had meant to emphasize.\n“Theearliest texts bear within themselves proofs, not only of having been composed,\nbut also of having been revised, or edited, long before the days of king Mena [or\nMenes], and judging from many passages in the copies inscribed in hieroglyphics\nupon the pyramids of Unas [and other early kings], it would seem that, even at that\nremote date, the scribes were perplexed and hardly understood the texts which they\nhad before them.”\nConcerning a particular, and very important, “chapter” of the Book of the Dead—a\n“chapter” that has been considered “an abridgment of the whole Book of the Dead” —and\nbasing his opinion on that of Chabas, Budge affirms that it was not only “very ancient” and\n“very mysterious,” but “very difficult to understand” even “fourteen centuries before our\nera.” Can we, millennia later, fare any better in our attempt to understand these texts? And\nis it merely Egyptian texts that will pose this problem for us?\nIn speaking of the great epics of the Germans, the Indians, Finns and other ancient\npeoples, Sigmund Freud claimed that the original cause behind these epics had already fallen",

Will we, so many centuries later, be able to ferret out “the cause behind these epics”?\nOf course, as anyone who has ever read anything about him knows, Freud had his\nown psychoanalytic beliefs in mind when he referred to ancient myths. As Richard Heinberg noted, “proponents of the non-historical approach to myth interpretations are more or less forced not so much to explain...myths as to explain them away.” And, despite myth in general is starting to lose ground.\nWhat good can still be said of Freud’s psychoanalytic methods, in the end, that is exactly what he did in his attempts to analyze the messages he believed to be contained in ancient myth—he ended up by explaining\nthem away. Fortunately, as Heinberg also noted, “the ‘collective fantasy’ approach to\nevents or situations.”\nThus, despite his own calling as a psycho-\nanalyst, Theodore Reik had to admit that:\n“[Myths] appeared to us at first as\ncollective daydreams, as wish fulfillment of the masses. Such a char-\nacterization is still psychologically valid, but we apply today the inter-\npretation of myths in the hope of dis-\ncovering at their depths precipita-\ntions or sediments of real historical\ncovering at their depths precipitated.\n",

As the “lord of the\ncrown,” the deity can be understood as the crowned god. Thus he can say that his seat is on\nhis throne. There is nothing enigmatic about a crowned god sitting on his throne. But what\ndoes it mean that the deity is, or resides, “in the Eye” or that he sits “in the pupil of the Eye”?\nWhat is this “Eye” in which the god resides? And why is the eye equated with his egg? What\nhas an eye to do with an egg? What is this egg anyway?\nAnd yet, enigmatic as these words are, together with others pertaining to different themes,\nan in-depth study will reveal their coherence and even logic once the key to the symbolism\nbehind them is understood.\nMISTRANSLATIONS\nOnce myths were put into writing, mistranslations were bound to occur. Here, an illustration offered by Bob Forrest comes immediately to mind.\n“I can imagine how odd anomalies could arise in transmission, and this point was\nbrought home to me by a curious example I came across just recently: Cinderella’s\nglass slipper. I had always found it peculiar that the slipper should be said to be made\nof glass, but according to Brewer’s ‘Dictionary of Phrase and Fable’ this came about\nvia a mistranslation of the phrase ‘pantoufle en vair’ (a fur slipper) as ‘a glass slipper’\n(pantoufle en verre). I do not suppose, though, that the vagaries of oral transmission\ncan account for more than the odd ‘peculiarity’ of a myth, legend or story.”\nAnother example concerns one of the most famous sayings attributed to Jesus: “It is easier\nfor a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom\nof God.” As Vitaliano indicated, this is more than probably a mistranslation of the\ngreek, in which the Gospels were originally written, where the Greek word for\n“rope” — kameylos — was mistranslated as “camel” — kamelos. ” This is because the sound of\nthe Greek letter phi sounds very similar to that of epsilon to a foreign ear. Thus the words of\nJesus should be translated as: “It is easier for a rope to go through the eye of a needle, than\nfor a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God”—which, let’s face it, makes for a better\nsimile.\nWhen it comes to Hebrew, in which the books of the Old Testament were originally set\ndown, we encounter even greater difficulties because, for one thing, Biblical Hebrew was\nwritten without vowels, thus making for confusion between words containing the same consonants but different vowel sounds, and, for another, there are over a thousand Hebrew words\nwhich appear only in the Old Testament, and, in some cases, appear there only once. How,\nthen, without comparison, can the meaning of such words be verified with certainty?\nAs will be seen in forthcoming pages, such mistranslations, which owe more to the written word than they do to oral tradition, permeate the mythological sources of most ancient\nnations. But, rather than proving detrimental to our cause, such mistranslations, where found,\nshall actually help us ferret out the truth.",

            "content": "MISINTERPRETATIONS\nThe casual reader of popular mythology may not realize to what extent the subject is infused with astronomical content. This is partly due to the aversion displayed by most modern mythologists to anything in their studies that smacks of astronomical connections. This is so true that when Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend dared to go against the common trend in their monumental work, Hamlet’s Mill, they found the doors of academia closed shut in their face. As Martin Bernal found reason to state:\n“Having written a major book on Galileo, de Santillana [whom Bernal qualifies as\npossibly the greatest historian of Renaissance science] became interested in the Hermetic Egyptian tradition; then, late in life, he read Dupuis’s Origine de tous les cultes, and was convinced by its argument that much of ancient mythology was indeed allegory for scientific astronomy.\n“Despite de Santillana’s enormous reputation, Hamlet’s Mill—the book in which he and a younger German colleague [Hertha von Dechend] set out [such a mytho-astronomical] scheme—was not accepted by any university press and was published commercially. This means that respectable scholars are not obliged to take such work into account. In addition, de Santillana’s having stuck his neck out so far lessened his effectiveness as a [historian]. Furthermore, his work ... could be lumped together with a more or less ‘lunatic fringe’; this allowed or even compelled orthodox scholars to ignore it.”\nEarlier in this century, mythologists were quite aware of the astronomical nature of ancient myths, but, of lately, the general assumption has been that these astral connections are of late derivation, having been foisted on an already existing mythology. So much can be said against this that volumes, of which this is one, can be written.\nThe problem, however, goes deeper than that because even those earlier mythologists who had accepted the astronomical nature of the myths were themselves often guilty of tampering with their sources so that, today, it is not easy to discern what these ancient sources really had to say about the cosmic powers our ancestors venerated. This is not to be wondered at because, if one had to pursue the astronomical motifs inherent in most of mythology, one would be forced to assume that the ancients’ perception of the celestial sphere was entirely different from that of modern man. Thus, when modern mythologists pursue these astral myths, they tend to look up at the sky, if only figuratively, and realize that what the ancient records state about the planets, and even the Sun and Moon, bears absolutely no resemblance to the present Solar System. And yet one must keep in mind that these self-same ancients, as we shall see in the next chapter, were quite sophisticated when it came to observational astronomy. Thus something of a dilemma faces the mythologist as was poignantly demonstrated, a few decades ago, by Irene Nicholson.\nIn a Mayan scheme purported to describe the celestial sphere, Nicholson discovered that the planet Venus was positioned above the Sun, below which was the Milky Way and, below that, the Moon.” Knowing full well that the Maya had been better astronomers than that, she attempted to circumvent the problem by blaming these disparities on a faulty record.",
