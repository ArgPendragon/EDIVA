            "content": "All times’... yet it seems advisable to emphasize, on the one hand, that technical terminology has its own laws and is not subject to the jurisdiction of linguists, and to point, on the other hand, to one of the Sanskrit names of Saturn, i.e., 'Kala,' meaning 'time.' Thus, in Sanskrit, one of the names for the planet Saturn and the word for 'time' are one and the same, both rendered 'Kala.' But also:\n\n'It should be stressed that the disinclination of philologists to allow for the essential connection of Chronos and Kronos rests upon the stern belief that the god Saturn has nothing to do with the planet Saturn, and upon the supposition that an expert in classical philology has nothing whatever to learn from Indian texts. Were it not so, they might have stumbled over Kala, i.e., Chronos, as a name of Yama, i.e., Kronos, alias the planet Saturn.'\n\nThat Time (Kala) was a name of Yama can also be learned from E. Burgess; that the Hindu Yama, the same as the Persian Yima, was Saturn can be learned from Hermann Collitz. So that this, also, is the same as saying that Time was another name for Saturn.\n\nBesides, leaving Chronos aside, Kronos was himself lauded as 'the originator of times.'\n\nKALA\n\nTo the Hindus, the 'Wheel of Time' is known as the Kala-cakra (or 'chakra'). Of importance to our thesis is the fact that it was Brahma, i.e., Saturn, who is said to turn this wheel of time. In the Svetasvatara Upanishad, it is stated that: 'Some wise men, deluded, speak of Nature, and others of Time as the cause of everything, but it is the greatness of God by which this Brahma-wheel is made to turn.' Thus the same source alludes to Brahma as 'the time of time.' The Mundaka Upanishad proclaims that the year, indeed, came from Brahma. What has also significant meaning is the added fact that the waters of chaos, which we have previously had reason to connect with Saturn, were said to have arisen from Kala."

            "content": "In the Atharva Veda it is stated that: 'Time is the lord of all, who was the father of Prajapati' but also that 'time in the beginning [is or was] Prajapati.' That Prajapati is to be identified as Saturn need not be repeated. The Satapatha Brahmana tells us that 'Vaishvanara... truly is the year, and Prajapati is the year.' In fact, Prajapati is alluded to as 'the year' in numerous passages of the same work. There, Varuna, whom we have also identified as Saturn, is also referred to as 'the year.' Meanwhile, we have already seen Vishnu, whom we have also equated with Saturn, being lauded as Mahakala, which name we have translated as 'Great Saturn.' But, seeing as Kala also means Time, the same epithet can be translated as 'Great Time.' The result is the same because, as all the above should have indicated by now, as far as the ancients were concerned, the god and planet Saturn was synonymous with time. Thus Iranian Time was also personified as Zurvan, whose Saturnian identity, as we have already seen, is well attested.\n\nAccording to the Atharva Veda, Kala, who was both Time and the planet Saturn, was considered the very first god, which is in keeping with our thesis. As we had also seen in an earlier chapter, Dhruva, the Pole star, had also been an earlier name of Saturn and, as such, the word dhruva came to have the meanings of 'time,' 'epoch,' and/or 'era.'\n\nTHE SLOW-MOVING PLANET\n\nThe association of time with the planet Saturn could not, of course, have eluded mythologists and, in seeking an explanation, they naturally appealed to logic. Back in 1875, Gustave Schlegel, citing Dupuis, justified the phenomenon by referring to the planet’s present lagging orbital pace:\n\n'“The planet, with its slow and heavy walk, imitating age, drags itself along its path, in a manner of speaking; before finishing its revolution, it would have seen a great number of men die whom it had seen born, so slow was its pace... He [i.e., Saturn] was the father of the years and the centuries... his was the longest measure of time which nature seemed to give for a single revolution of one of the celestial bodies or one of the moving stars. Is it not, therefore, natural to believe that the Ancients, who had attributed to each star its domain and its function in Nature, should have given to the planet Saturn the supervision of the celestial movements which regulate the length of the years and the centuries?”'\n\n2 Ibid., XIX:53:8-10 (emphasis added).\n8 Satapatha Brahmana V:2:5:14.\n2 Ibid., I:1:4:10.\n3 VS.

            "content": "Stecchini, on the other hand, reversed the process by assuming that it was 'because of Kronos’s association with time that his name was given to the most distant of the seven heavenly bodies... because it concludes its orbit in 30 years, so that a day in its year corresponds to a month in the earth’s year.'\n\nSaturn’s slow motion along its orbit, however, does not explain why the planet was also chosen to represent the year. If any celestial body can presently claim the right to represent the year, it surely would have to be the Sun. As an indicator of the passage of time, it remains supreme. Even the Moon would have been a better indicator with which to gauge the progress of time. Moreover, our ancient forebears, living in this primeval era, would hardly have even noticed the planet Saturn if it then appeared, like now, as nothing but a pinpoint of light in the night sky. More importantly, Dupuis’s, or Schlegel’s, as also Stecchini’s, expositions do not explain what Saturn, even as Time personified, had to do with Creation. Besides, why would the slowness of the planet Saturn have led ancient man to believe in an era when time was not?\n\nAs we have indicated in earlier pages, and as we shall show more fully in a sequel volume, it was the Saturnian deity who was held responsible for the Creation. But, in an Iranian Rivayat, this role is bestowed on Time. 'Time is both Creator and the Lord of Creation which it created,' it is there stated. This is paralleled by the Atharva Veda which states that 'Time created the earth.' A curious passage concerning Creation in a Hindu Brahmana brings various elements together:\n\n'“Then the seed [of Creation] became a year. Before that time there was no year.”'\n\nThus, despite the fact that the waters of chaos were said to have been born of Time, as we have seen above, the reverse was just as true. As it was said, the waters of chaos themselves produced the year, 'the ordainer of the days and nights.' We also have it from the Maitri Upanishad that 'the year, verily, is Prajapati [that is Saturn, who] is Time.'\n\nWhat all this intimates is that what Hindu sources term as 'the year' is a synonym for 'time.' This synonymy is also apparent in Hebrew where yom (or yowm), which is normally taken to mean 'day,' has the additional meaning of 'year' but also 'time.' Similarly, in Egyptian, the word thera, which means 'year,' also means 'time.' Thus, Ptah, whom we have already seen identified as Saturn, was called 'the Lord of the Year,' whereas Atum, his alter-ego, was called 'the Lord of Time.' The two epithets are synonymous.",

            "content": "Dionysus\n\nIn our first chapter, we saw Dionysus as the original impetus behind Greek drama. But who was this god?\n\nThe mythology of Dionysus presents him as a rambunctious conqueror who spread terror, as well as civilization, to the known world. Wherever he went, he introduced the grapevine and, with it, the fermentation of wine. In this respect, he was similar to the Egyptian Osiris/Saturn who also traveled the known world, bringing civilization to the countries he visited, as did other Saturnian deities.\n\nEusebius Pamphili (c. 260-340 A.D.) already knew that the Greek Dionysus was the equivalent of the Egyptian Osiris. He knew about this equation from Plutarch (c. 46-120 A.D.) and the even earlier Herodotus who lived in the 5th century B.C.* The similarity between Dionysus and Osiris, moreover, did not merely concern their histories as civilizers, but even their rites. This was so much so that Herodotus was driven to claim that the rites of Dionysus could only have been borrowed by the Greeks from the Egyptians. These similarities, however, are not restricted to Dionysus and Osiris, but are common to various other Saturnian deities. (There is also some indication that, in some quarters, Dionysus was identified as an alter-ego of Helios®, who, as we have already seen, was the original Greek name of the planet Saturn.)\n\nThe association of time with Saturn explains why the much later festivals of the New Year, touched upon briefly in preceding pages, were devoted to Saturn in his many guises. We should therefore not be surprised to find that among these festivals were those held in honor of Dionysus, who is not only identifiable as the Saturnalian king but also directly as the Saturnian deity. It was not spurious of William Heidel to note the obvious connection of Dionysus with Aion®. As Marija Gimbutas informed her readers: 'In these festivals, which have assimilated elements of deep antiquity, Dionysus appears as a year-god.'",
