            "content": "“In spite of his accomplishments in plasma waves, the electromagnetic nature of comets, the critical ionization velocity prediction, the father of magnetohydrodynamics, Hannes Alfvén spent most of his career developing a plasma cosmology [which] is complete and consistent and modern in-situ solar system measurements continue to support it.”[5]\n\nAs we have seen above, it was Alfvén’s belief that the “vast magnetic vortices, operating through the pinch effect” can draw plasma together in space, which then itself forms not only galaxies and galaxy clusters, but also stars and planets.[5] But what is this pinch effect?\n\nAn experiment conducted with an empty can of diet Coke, as explained by Thornhill, illustrates the phenomenon quite clearly. The can was placed in the centre of an electric coil through which a strong jolt of current was passed. The can instantly collapsed, catapulted into the air, and came down too hot to touch. The manner in which the can collapsed was through a pinching effect around its middle, thus forming an hour-glass shape. As Thornhill explains:\n\n“The response to the magnetic field [generated by the coil] occurred because the can is a metal and can conduct electricity. In space, plasma is a conductor and behaves in the same way. It is this response to the magnetic force, created by a universal or galactic discharge, that efficiently coalesces and heats diffuse dust and gas embedded in plasma to form galaxies and stars, or constrains the narrow jets of active galaxies. It is this mechanism also which squeezes, heats, and jets material upwards against gravity in a powerful lightning discharge.”[8]\n\nOr, in Peratt’s words:\n\n“[Cosmic bodies] are formed out of the original intersolar or intergalactic plasma through which the currents are flowing that causes the pinching of the plasma down to a dense state. Then, at least according to my book, or rather Alfvén and the Department of Physics at the Royal Institute of Technology, matter accretes inwards to form ‘planetisimals’ and eventually planets.”\n\nStill based on laboratory plasma experiments, this led Peratt to claim that Earth would have formed at the same time that proto-Saturn itself did. As deduced “from laboratory framing pictures progressing in time” and “scaled to planetary dimensions,” Peratt could add that:\n\n“Originally the plasmoids were all about the same size...But some accreted more efficiently and then cascaded to smaller terrestrials from the Giant Plasmoids [or Gas giants] they had been...This configuration could have been recorded anytime over the course of the development of man.”",

            "content": "As Peratt, however, clarified, there is no reason for a particular plasmoid to condense at the same rate as the others. In fact, in keeping with scaled-down experiments, it is found that “all of the plasmoids or planetisimals accrete matter at different rates, some finally having captured enough material to condense in size gravitationally.”\n\nMoreover, Peratt is of the opinion that our Sun itself developed “out of a cosmic pinch.” As he explained: “The planets, also created out of a cosmic pinch, presumably from a current running parallel to the Sun’s, produced a polar column of plasmoids that retained their magnetic fields, even as they contracted to planetisimals [and eventually] to planets.”\n\nThis would then explain his insistence that brown dwarfs do not emit jets, since the planetary column would not have formed out of proto-Saturn but, on the contrary, proto-Saturn would have formed out of the jet. This would also explain his insistence concerning the pre-existence of proto-Saturn’s polar column.\n\nHaving spent his entire life immersed in plasma physics, it is not easy to counteract Peratt’s claims. Even so, at this point, with so much yet to learn, a final verdict concerning the origin of the proto-Saturnian system would be premature. Whether cosmic bodies emit jets, or jets form cosmic bodies, remains temporarily unresolved. Whether the sub-brown dwarf that was proto-Saturn was ejected from a star, or whether it was formed independent of any star, remains outside the scope of the present work. Whether proto-Saturn ejected the plasmoid that was to become Earth, to say nothing of the possibility of other planets, poleward or otherwise, or whether proto-Saturn and its attendants all formed at the same time, will be discussed more fully in the proposed sequel to this work.\n\nEND OF ACT ONE\n\nIn order to simplify the theory propounded in this work, our theses must now be expanded and reshuffled into a more appropriate chronological order.\n\nHypothesis #1: That the present gas giant planet we know by the name of Saturn had previously been a sub-brown dwarf star free floating in space outside the demarcation of the present Solar System.\n\nHypothesis #2: That, from what can be deduced from ancient as well as primitive astronomical lore, Earth had once been a satellite of this proto-Saturnian sub-star, which, because of its proximity, loomed large in the sky as a distinct disc larger than the apparent size of the full Moon.\n\nHypothesis #3: That, during this period, a nebulous entity, which our ancestors had difficulty in describing clearly, surrounded the Saturnian primary. We have conjectured this entity to have been a placental cloud, or circumstellar disk, surrounding the Saturnian orb in its equatorial plane. This entity seems to have been that to which the ancients alluded to as Chaos.\n\nHypothesis #4: During this same unspecified period, the Saturnian orb was seen to float over an apparition which, to ancient man, looked like a sheet of celestial water, a cosmic ocean. Whether this “water” was the same conjectural circumstellar disk, which would have had the appearance of a celestial whirlpool, an auroral manifestation, or a combination of both phenomena, is not now easily determined.\n\nHypothesis #5: That, still according to ancient astronomical lore, during this indeterminate period, Saturn was the only visible celestial body in Earth’s primordial sky.",

            "content": "Hypothesis #6: That, as seen from Earth, the Saturnian primary did not rise and/or set, but remained visibly immobile at all times.\n\nHypothesis #7: That Saturn’s immobility was due to the fact that Earth was stationed directly “beneath” Saturn’s south pole and that, from Earth, Saturn therefore appeared to be permanently fixed in the north celestial sphere, the very place now occupied by the Pole Star. What this also means is that Saturn and Earth were linearly aligned with both of them sharing the same axis of rotation.\n\nHypothesis #8: That what appeared as a slow-twirling, relatively narrow beam of tapering light connected the proto-Saturnian orb to Earth’s north polar region. This ray from above is interpreted as a sustained plasma discharge in the form of Birkeland current, a scaled down version, or the slowly deteriorating remnant, of a so-called plasma “jet” such as can be seen emanating from stellar, and even galactic, objects.\n\nHypothesis #9: That, according to some of man’s earliest memories, Earth was originally engulfed in what our ancestors persistently referred to as darkness. This was an age which, despite its remoteness in time, ended up etching itself indelibly in human consciousness. It was a time during which the Sun, the Moon, and the stars were not yet visible in the sky. Saturn ruled alone.\n\nHypothesis #10: This age, we have also found out, could not have been one of total darkness, and that, in fact, mankind itself remembers that the Saturnian deity actually shed a feeble light. The terrestrial environment during this age was bathed in a perpetual twilight or, rather, a protracted dawn, which man remembered as the dawn of Creation.\n\nHypothesis #11: That both Earth and Saturn were embedded in a plasmasphere centered on proto-Saturn, the opacity of which enabled proto-Saturn’s radiation to be reflected toward all terrestrial latitudes.\n\nHypothesis #12: Proto-Saturn’s illumination, feeble as it might have been, together with the plasmasphere’s opacity are recognized as the means by which the stars were kept from visibility. The Sun, needless to say, was still too far to be seen, while the Moon had not yet been captured by Earth.\n\nHypothesis #13: There is also the possibility that, due to Saturn’s former greater mass and rate of dimming, it might have been even warmer and slightly brighter in ages previous to the advent of mankind.\n\nHypothesis #14: That, under the scheme described above, Earth would have received enough heat to sustain life. This heat would have radiated directly from proto-Saturn’s close proximity about Earth’s northern hemisphere. The southern latitude would also have received sufficient warmth, even if a feebler light, from the radiation that would have been reflected off the inner surface of proto-Saturn’s plasmasphere with which Earth would have been enveloped. In the northern hemisphere, this indirect radiation would have added to the direct heat and light received from above Earth’s northern pole. Thus, during this time, Earth’s climatic environment would have been one without seasonal change, luxuriating in one single season of eternal spring. (It should, however, be noted that Earth would also have been subjected to slightly different latitudinal temperatures.) Tropical and/or sub-tropical flora and fauna were thus able to thrive in Earth’s northern region, even within the present Arctic circle, and the possibility exists that this flora and fauna originated in these regions before migrating to more southerly latitudes. Judging by paleontological remains in Earth’s geologic strata, this environment stretched back into the remote past, possibly as far as the Cretaceous Period, definitely as far as the Paleocene Epoch of the Tertiary Period. Exactly what situation prevailed before that remains to be examined, but since Earth is postulated to have been a satellite of proto-Saturn from its very onset, it becomes evident that all past ages prior to the Pleistocene, including the origin of life, must be reconsidered under this hypothesized scheme.",

            "content": "Hypothesis #15: That, due to Saturn’s immobility, and the absence of the Sun, ancient man had nothing at his disposal by which he could calculate the passage of time.\n\nHypothesis #16: That, at a later time, Saturn shone much brighter than it had previously done, bright enough for ancient man to allude to it consistently as a sun.\n\nHypothesis #17: That this primordial Saturnian sun shone during that time we today call the night.\n\nHypothesis #18: That, at some point in time, as the Saturnian system drew closer to the Sun, the Saturnian plasmasphere changed its wavelength, thus robbing it of its former near-opacity. It was at this time that ancient man was able to catch a glimpse of the slowly approaching Sun, at first appearing no bigger than a star, but growing ever larger and brighter.\n\nOne question that pops up at this point, and one that I have often been asked, is: What was man doing during this time of free wandering through space? And my answer has always been: Nothing much. Men, women, and children went about their business, whatever that might have been, entirely indifferent to the Saturnian apparition towering above them. And why should they have paid it any heed?\n\nIn our present situation, the Sun rises, traverses the sky, and sets. It appears red on rising, a blinding yellow throughout most of the day, and dims back to red on setting. The Moon also rises and sets, appears of an orange color and illusively larger when nearer the horizon, turning to yellow and then white as it gains height in the sky. Unlike the Sun, it can be seen, when seen at all, during both day and night. More importantly, it grows and diminishes as an expanding and contracting crescent, appearing as a full circular orb in between, and does so once every month. At times the Moon is seen passing in front of the Sun, causing a partial, annular, or total eclipse. At other times, Earth itself comes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow across the face of our lunar neighbor, thus causing a partial or total lunar eclipse. These are events that would have mesmerized our primitive ancestors, as in fact, in later times, they did.\n\nPrior to its actual shining as a sun of night, proto-Saturn would have been bereft of any such changes. Until that time, it did not even brighten and dim. It just hung there, doing nothing. True, had it to suddenly re-appear in this modern age, its towering apparition would awe us, but only because we are now used to a different sky. Those who were born, brought up, and lived beneath its splendor would have simply taken it for granted for the simple reason that it had always been there.\n\nAs mentioned before, those who might have dared approach the shining ray from above would have first felt the wind that would have enveloped the far outer fringes of the plasma discharge; they would have heard the electrical hum emanating from it; and they would have experienced the prickling of their scalp and the hairs on their body due to electrical excitation. Both man and beast alike would have known better than to approach nearer.\n\nOne could also ask: Did man even inhabit such northern regions in those far off times? Why not—especially since the Arctic was the warmest place on Earth? Stone tools, similar to those retrieved in East Africa, obviously worked by man, have been unearthed in fifteen different sites beneath the permafrost in present Siberia. Traces of Stone Age settlements, containing “bone implements and arrowheads, as well as needles and axes skillfully fashioned from mammoth tusks,” have been found in the New Siberian Islands. Prehistoric petroglyphs depicting the “well-preserved incised outlines of whales and deer” are still to be seen on the cliffs of Spitzbergen. Primitive stone tools, as well as the remains of a prehistoric camp, dated as early as 2300 B.C., have been discovered on Ellesmere Island. Petroglyphs depicting reindeer, bears, elk, whales, and even humans fishing from a boat, dated from 4000 to 6000 B.C., have been found on an Arctic island off the coast of Norway. Only heaven knows what might still lie buried beneath the permafrost of these and other Arctic lands.\n\nJudging by what man has left us from those far off times, it becomes evident that he was not originally concerned with recording his past achievements or the events which shaped his life. But man did not completely forget what his condition had been like before the heavens changed. Among those who remembered were the descendants of the Peruvian Incas. As they eventually had it recorded:\n\n“Where we live now we see villages and cities; we see streams flowing down from the mountains, and being led this way and that to water our crops and our trees; we see flocks of llamas feeding on good grass with their lambs—countless flocks. But in those days we lived where there were thickets and barren rocks; we had no llamas; we had no crops; we knew not how to make the waters flow this way and that way; we had no villages, no cities, no temples. We lived in clefts of the rocks and holes in the ground. The covering of our bodies was of bark or of leaves, or else we went naked in the day and without covering to put over us at night. We ate roots that we pulled up out of the ground, or else we fought with the foxes for the dead things they were carrying away. No one bore rule amongst us, and we knew nothing of duty or kindness of one to another.”\n\nThis was the state of man’s being as his world free-floated through space. But then came a time when man’s environment drastically changed. There came a time when heaven brewed a new production. And it happened without warning. Coming ever nearer to our present Solar System, proto-Saturn finally came within the attractive clutches of the Sun. After aeons of uniform celestial sameness, an event finally transpired that was so stupendous, so unnerving, that it went down in history as Day One.\n\nThe story of that glorious event, as also of what followed, will be told in the planned sequel to this work.\n\nStay tuned.",
