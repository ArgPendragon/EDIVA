            "content": "Revolve around it! Like the priests of other nations, we learn that, when officiating before the Altar of Heaven, the Chinese Emperor always faced north.\nTHE EUROPEAN EVIDENCE\nIt was no different in ancient Greece. In neo-Platonist philosophy, for instance, Kronos/Saturn was associated with the pole. Orphic thought also identified Chronos who, as we shall see, was the same as Kronos, as the power behind the turning of the heavens around the polar axis. It is therefore no surprise that, when praying, the ancient Greeks too faced to the north.\nIn time, the sacredness of the north was bound to touch terrestrial realms which, in European thought, remained philologically bound to Saturn through Kronos. The Greeks themselves referred to the North Sea as Kronios Okeanos, or the Saturnian Sea. The adjective “Cronian,” derived from “Kronos,” has even survived in the English language as descriptive of the Arctic Ocean.\nAs Warren discovered, the same idea persisted in Etruria, before Rome:\n“Varro and other Latin writers confirm this general representation, so that all modern expounders of the old Etruscan religion unite in locating the abode of the gods of Etruria in the Centre of Heaven, the northern circumpolar sky. Niebuhr and other authorities of the highest rank assure us that the Romans shared the same faith.”\nThus, Ovid, in his Fasti, offers a description of Creation, at the conclusion of which Janus is made to state: “The guardianship of this vast universe is in my hands alone, and none but me may rule the wheeling pole.” As Roger Ashton indicated:\n“The centre of the wheeling pole is motionless to the terrestrial observer. Janus, ruler of the motionless celestial pole, must thus be located at the Celestial Pole.”^1^\nWhen Saturnus was flung down from his celestial seat, he was said to have continued ruling from “the opposite end of the world axis,”^2^ which presupposes a former position corresponding to the northern polar station. But even here, we do not really require such a circuitous route to the Latin Saturn’s former polar placement since Saturnus himself was remembered as the god of “the steadfast star,”” which star is understood as the Pole Star.",

            "content": "THE SUN OF THE CENTRE AND OTHER ECHOES\nThe Aztec god Xiuhtecuhtli was also known as Huehueteotl, that is “the old god,” and/or “the old god of the centre,” as well as Ixcozauhqui, that is revered as “the sun of the centre” and “he of the yellow face.” He was revered as “the sun of the centre” and “he of the yellow face.” He was revered as “the central fire,” thus bringing to mind the central fire of Philolaos. He was described as the pivot of the turning heavens and identified with the celestial pole. Although Xiuhtecuhtli is nowhere in Mesoamerican mythology specifically identified as the planet Saturn, we can see that he was a very old god who personified a yellow-faced sun which stood at the centre of the celestial pole. The description is apt and, to be sure, Brundage was astute enough to recognize Xiuhtecuhtli as “the Aztec Xiuhtecuhtli—the yellow-faced sun which stood at the centre of the celestial pole.” Cronus [the same as Kronos/Saturn], the first king and Lord of Time.”^3^\nIt should perhaps be noted here that, as the god of fire, and very much like the Mesopotamian Ninurta—if not for similar reasons—Xiuhtecuhtli also bore some non-Saturnian traits which we shall endeavor to resolve in a future work. In the meantime, there is yet one more motif which ties the deity in question inextricably to Saturn that we shall have reason to explore in a following page of this work.\nMeanwhile, in a previous chapter we met the Yuki creator Taiké-mol, whose name translates as “Solitude Walker,” and who we had reason to identify as the solitary Saturnian sun. It is, therefore, worth noting that Taiké-mol was also said to have resided in the north. Thus, when the Damaras of Africa claim that their “highest deity,” Omakuru, “dwells in the far North,” we can be certain that the reference is to their own version of the Saturnian deity.",

            "content": "SINTERKLAAS\nThe belief in the northern placement of the Saturnian sun perpetuated itself down through the ages in various mystic societies and other traditions in which Saturn continued to be remembered as “the old man who lives at the north pole.” If this has a familiar ring to it, the reader is not mistaken. In fact, as Manly Hall observed:\n“Saturn, the old man who lives at the north pole, and brings with him to the children of men a sprig of evergreen (the Christmas tree), is familiar to the little folks under the name Santa Claus.”\nTo be sure, Santa Claus can be said to have had an entirely different origin, one that stemmed from the life of Nicholas of Myra. While the history of Nicholas is somewhat obscure, his cult became a very popular one in Christian circles. What is known of him is that he was the bishop of Myra, in Lycia, a region in present-day Turkey, during the time of the Roman emperor Diocletian (A.D. 245-313). Persecuted and tortured for his Christian faith, Nicholas was then imprisoned until released during the tolerant reign of Constantine. Sanctified by the Christian Church, he was honored by Latins as well as Greeks by an annual feast held on December 6th.\nNicholas’ connection with the myth of Santa Claus arose out of the legend which claims that he was once responsible for clandestinely bestowing dowries to three daughters of a poor citizen who, not having been able to procure decent marriages for them, was about to give them up to a house of prostitution. This event inaugurated the tradition of giving presents in secret on the eve of his feast day, that is on December 6th.\nThe name Santa Claus itself is merely the English corruption of the Dutch form of Saint Nicholas—that is Sinterklaas—which transpired when the tradition was introduced to America by early Dutch colonists.\nThere is, of course, no direct connection between Saint Nicholas and the north pole in which Santa Claus is said to reside. So how did the belief originate?\nThe date of Jesus’ birth has never been ascertained (and it never will be). The Christian feast commemorating the event had originally shifted to and fro all over the calendar. Somewhere around 354 A.D., Latin Christians decided on December 25th since this had been the date on which the feast of Mithra, whose religion had become the main competitor of the Christian one, and which had been amalgamated with that of Sol Invictus, was held. This raised dissent among the Christian community of other countries, especially among the Syrians and Armenians, who continued to celebrate the birth of Jesus on whatever day their own tradition had dictated. In A.D. 440, however, the Fathers of the Christian Church decided to revert to December 25th as the official date since this was also the day of the winter solstice which had for long been a day of celebration. This was also the time during which the feast of Saturn, known as the Saturnalia, was celebrated. Originating as a New Year festival, the Saturnalia was held on December 17th, but was gradually extended to seven days up to December 23rd. The Greek, and original, version of the Roman Saturnalia, however, was the Greek Kronia, likewise dedicated to Kronos/Saturn, and this used to be held on December.",

            "content": "FIFTH INTERLUDE\nAs we have seen, the mytho-historical record consistently bombards one with allusions from every mythological quarter that persistently associate the ancient Saturnian sun god with the north and, more specifically, the north celestial sphere. And it is the collective strength of such traditions, ranging all the way from Sumero/Babylonian times to the present, that impels one to believe that, as far as our ancient forefathers were concerned, the primeval sun god had once inhabited that place in Earth’s northern sky that is presently occupied by the Pole Star. Although all this might be new to the public-at-large, I am not revealing any esoteric secrets. Mythologists have known it all for quite some time. Gerald Massey, William Warren, Zelia Nuttal, Uno Holmberg, René Guenon, and others we have already had occasion to mention as well as those mentioned below—they all wrote extensive works bearing on the subject. As David Talbott noted:\n“...the tradition of a former polar god or polar sun has been chronicled by a host of scholars; together they have succeeded in demonstrating a universal tradition. In the late nineteenth century John J. O’Neil even recognized the god as Saturn and had to contrive a distinction between the god and the planet to account for the identity. Later, the specific connection of the planet [Saturn] with the Pole was noted by Léopold de Saussure. But not one of these innovative researchers ever wondered if their polar suns or polar gods might have actually been there!\"\nGiorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend are prime among those who have researched the subject, but have objected to a literal interpretation of what these ancient messages portray. Since their own research took them far and wide across the entire world in digging through the mytho-historical record, they had no option but to accept that, as far as the ancients were concerned, Saturn had once resided in the place now occupied by the Pole Star. “This is puzzling at first,” they state. “What has Saturn, the far-out planet, to do with the pole?” they ask. They even admit that “the reader is not the first to be perplexed by an imagery which allows for the presence of planets at the pole...””* And then comes the objection: “It is not in the line of modern astronomy to establish any link connecting the planets with Polaris, or with any star, indeed, out of reach of the members of the zodiacal system.” TM\nSo how do they explain the ancient belief in Saturn’s former polar placement? Their answer is that “such figures of speech were an essential part of the technical idiom of archaic astrology...” Nowhere, however, do they tell us what it was that gave rise to these “figures of speech.” Nowhere do they tell us why “such figures of speech” were thought to be essential. Furthermore, would such “figures of speech” have been incorporated throughout the entire world? Would all the ancient races have chosen the same “figures of speech”? Would they all have decided to place Saturn in a locality it never occupied? And would they all have chosen the north celestial pole as that locality? What purpose would it have served?\nDespite the fact that, in this Saturnian scenario, Lynn Rose opted for an Earth phase-locked with Saturn to account for the latter’s apparent immobility, even he had to admit that, as far as the ancients were concerned, Saturn’s stated celestial station was at the north celestial pole. So how, then, did he get around the mytho-historical record’s obvious message? Taking a different, and more plausible, tack than de Santillana and von Dechend, he offered the following:\n“The traditions about an immovable Saturn atop some special pole made little sense after the Age of Kronos had come to an end. Those traditions were later revised and were attributed to the only ‘immovable’ point...that could be found in the newer sky. To people in the northern hemisphere...this was the north celestial pole...”^4^\nAnd:\n“As long as Saturn was atop its pole, the Age of Kronos endured. The immobility of that body was a sign of the stability of the cosmic order. Later...the stability of the north star was seen as an indication that the world or the world age was not yet coming to an end. The Age of Kronos had ended when the only immobile body in the sky had left its position atop the axis of the world; that was the main reason that the later ancients looked to the north star: it was now the body that lay atop the axis of the world, and, as long as it remained there, the world was stable. Thus there was a transfer from Saturn to the north star, with much attendant garbling. Traditions that emphasize the north, and especially those traditions that associate Saturn with the north, need to be interpreted very carefully. After Saturn left us, or we left Saturn, there was only one fixed point in the sky: the celestial pole of rotation...Much that has been said about Saturn would, in the absence of Saturn, have been transferred to the only thing in the new sky that displayed the sort of stability that Saturn had once displayed.”^5^\nThus, Rose believes that Saturn’s polar placement was the result of later revisions by those who could not otherwise make sense of the original accounts pertaining to Saturn’s immobility. But, as I had stated once before, this rationalization is not supported by the mytho-historical record. Rose does not even hazard a guess as to when this revision might have taken place or by whom. All he leaves us with is the statement that it happened “after the Age of Kronos had come to an end.”\nNow, while possible, is it probable that “these traditions” would have later been “revised” just about all over the world? And would they all have been revised in the same manner? Besides, had such revisions occurred, the revisionists would have been bound to overlook some data that would contradict the modified scheme. Yet nowhere in the mytho-historical record can one find such overlooked clues. Could the ancients have been that diligent in expurgating their received traditions? Is it believable that such expurgation would have taken place all over the world with such completeness?",

Yet nowhere in the mytho-historical record can one find such overlooked clues. Could the ancients have been that diligent in expurgating their received traditions? Is it believable that such expurgation would have taken place all over the world with such completeness?\nRose correctly informs us that, during the Saturnian age, the planet’s immobility was tantamount to cosmic stability. When Saturn’s immobile placement was catastrophically displaced, the stability of the cosmic order was impaired. Following this event, the only immobile object in the sky was the North or Pole Star. The immobility of this star became a sign of the stability of the new celestial order. It was because of this, according to Rose, that Saturn’s former phase-locked immobility was transferred to the North Star’s polar station. Yet, as we have seen through the parable of Vishnu and Dhruva, the record dictates exactly the opposite—that the polar station had been Saturn’s before it became the Pole Star’s. After all, what is the point in attempting to reconstruct a cosmic history based on the mytho-historical record if one ends up tampering with that record in order to make the data fit a different model than the one dictated by the record? As Frederic Jueneman once admonished, “the tapestry of myth is intricately woven, and each thread must be followed to wherever it leads, however improbable the initial appearance.” Despite the fact that Jueneman himself ended up by ignoring his own dictum, the point should be well taken. In Rose’s case, his Saturnian model was supposedly constructed on a system said to have been laid out by Philolaos. But, as I had indicated in an earlier work, Rose’s model bears but little resemblance to that system. When he, therefore, calls his scheme “Variations on a Theme of Philolaos,” the emphasis has to be on “Variations.” Rose himself indicated his awareness of this when he wrote:\n“We have supposedly been composing variations on a theme of Philolaos, but if there is truth in these variations, it will emerge that Philolaos or someone else was composing variations on another theme, and that what we know as the system of Philolaos is a garbled and misapplied version of or variations on what was once fact.”\nAll of which explains the changes, assumptions, deductions, arguments, stipulations, suggestions, ifs, and buts, that Rose was forced to lead his readers through in his effort to make sense of this “garbled” system and force-fit it into one of his own making. As I have pointed out once before, Rose will be the first to argue that this juggling was necessary to rid the system of its unrealistic aspects and supplanting them with something more defensible. Through similar procedures, however, the Philolaos system could be turned into any scheme of one’s own liking.\nIn our own scheme, as presented in this work, we make no changes to the mytho-historical record. We do not assume anything that is not there spelled out. Our deductions are based on what we find recorded. In other words, heeding Jueneman’s admonition, we have taken, as we will continue to take, the mytho-historical record at face value, no matter how improbable its initial appearance may be. There really would be no point in doing otherwise.\nIt may now be objected that had Saturn really occupied a position in Earth’s north celestial sphere, those people inhabiting Earth’s southern hemisphere would not have been able to see it. It therefore becomes obvious that any beliefs concerning these early cosmic events that emerge from the southern sector of our globe will have had to have migrated with the people who brought them there from areas farther north.\nNeedless to say, the only way in which Saturn could have appeared immobile in Earth’s north celestial sphere is if Earth had been stationed directly “beneath” Saturn’s south pole, a situation which would also mean that both planets had been sharing the same axis of rotation. We can therefore add Saturn’s immobility and its polar placement to our growing list of hypotheses which would now read as follows:\n\nHypothesis #1: That, from what can be deduced from ancient as well as primitive astronomical lore, Earth had once been a satellite of the planet Saturn which, because of its proximity, loomed large in the sky as a distinct disc larger than the apparent size of the full Moon.\n\nHypothesis #2: That, still according to ancient astronomical lore, during this indeterminate period, Saturn was the only visible celestial body in Earth’s primordial sky.\n\nHypothesis #3: That, still according to the ancients, during this same period, Saturn shone as a sun.\n\nHypothesis #4: That this primordial Saturnian sun shone during that time we today call the night.\n\nHypothesis #5: That, as seen from Earth, the Saturnian sun did not rise and/or set, but remained visibly immobile at all times.\n\nHypothesis #6: That Saturn’s immobility was due to the fact that Earth was stationed directly “below” Saturn’s south pole and that, from Earth, Saturn therefore appeared to be permanently fixed in the north celestial sphere, the very same place now occupied by the Pole Star. What this also means is that Saturn and Earth were linearly aligned with the both of them sharing the same axis of rotation.\n\nSeeing as there are no planets, or other celestial bodies, similarly aligned in the present order of our Solar System, the next logical question to ask is whether such an alignment of planets is physically possible.",

Presents had also been freely exchanged during the festivities of the Saturnalia, which custom then coincided with that held in honor of Saint Nicholas.\nWe can then see how the two traditions were merged into one—the giving of presents by Saint Nicholas on the eve of December 6th and the giving of presents by, or in honor of, Saturn anywhere from December 17th to December 25th. In the minds of the common people, Saint Nicholas was thus merged with Saturn, “the old man who lives at the north pole,” and the myth of Santa Claus was inadvertently born.",

            "content": "CHAPTER 11\nTesting the Model\nTHE DEMANDS OF A THEORY\nMake no apologies for the fact that the theory presented in this work was constructed on the basis of the mytho-historical record rather than through astrophysical considerations. I will only say in passing that, other than its mythological content, as we have seen, the mytho-historical record also incorporates the world-wide astronomical beliefs of our ancient forefathers, and that these beliefs coincide with their mytho-religious convictions. Ancient astronomical beliefs are therefore here being considered together with mythology as a unified whole regardless of the fact that what is thus coming to light tends to describe a Solar System that was entirely alien to the one we now inhabit.\nLater in this work we will attempt a validation of the physical feasibility of the model we have so far delineated, even though not all of the players in this unfolding cosmic scheme are yet in place. What I will add here is a reminder to the effect that many were the things once thought impossible which were eventually found to be possible, and that many of these ended up becoming dogmas of science. Easily coming to mind in this respect are the occurrence of meteoric falls, the non-illusory nature of comets, and continental drift. But let us put all that aside for the time being. Allow me instead to concentrate on the demands which our model itself raises, and whether or not these demands can be met.\nWhat do I mean by “demands”? Theories do not stand, if they are to stand at all, in isolation. They raise certain demands. For instance, the theory concerning the nuclear fueling of the Sun demands that the Sun shed a vast amount of subatomic particles known as neutrinos. But, despite large sums of money spent in constructing complex instruments to register them, not enough neutrinos, if any, have so far been detected. Raymond Davis, who has been “trapping” neutrinos for decades, “has consistently detected about one-third fewer neutrinos than predicted by theories of the solar interior,” which means only two-thirds the amount predicted. Most other experimenters, however, can only vouch for about one-third the predicted amount. As John Bahcall...",

            "content": "While the history of Nicholas is somewhat obscure, his cult became a very popular one in Christian circles. What is known of him is that he was the bishop of Myra, in Lycia, a region in present-day Turkey, during the time of the Roman emperor Diocletian (A.D. 245-313). Persecuted and tortured for his Christian faith, Nicholas was then imprisoned until released during the tolerant reign of Constantine. Sanctified by the Christian Church, he was honored by Latins as well as Greeks by an annual feast held on December 6th.\nNicholas’ connection with the myth of Santa Claus arose out of the legend which claims that he was once responsible for clandestinely bestowing dowries to three daughters of a poor citizen who, not having been able to procure decent marriages for them, was about to give them up to a house of prostitution. This event inaugurated the tradition of giving presents in secret on the eve of his feast day, that is on December 6th.\nThe name Santa Claus itself is merely the English corruption of the Dutch form of Saint Nicholas—that is Sinterklaas—which transpired when the tradition was introduced to America by early Dutch colonists.\nThere is, of course, no direct connection between Saint Nicholas and the north pole in which Santa Claus is said to reside. So how did the belief originate?\nThe date of Jesus’ birth has never been ascertained (and it never will be). The Christian feast commemorating the event had originally shifted to and fro all over the calendar. Somewhere around 354 A.D., Latin Christians decided on December 25th since this had been the date on which the feast of Mithra, whose religion had become the main competitor of the Christian one, and which had been amalgamated with that of Sol Invictus, was held. This raised dissent among the Christian community of other countries, especially among the Syrians and Armenians, who continued to celebrate the birth of Jesus on whatever day their own tradition had dictated. In A.D. 440, however, the Fathers of the Christian Church decided to revert to December 25th as the official date since this was also the day of the winter solstice which had for long been a day of celebration. This was also the time during which the feast of Saturn, known as the Saturnalia, was celebrated. Originating as a New Year festival, the Saturnalia was held on December 17th, but was gradually extended to seven days up to December 23rd. The Greek, and original, version of the Roman Saturnalia, however, was the Greek Kronia, likewise dedicated to Kronos/Saturn, and this used to be held on December.",

The author emphasizes that the theory is built upon mytho-historical records rather than purely astrophysical data, highlighting the integration of ancient astronomical beliefs with mythological narratives. The chapter outlines six hypotheses that form the foundation of the proposed model, questioning the physical feasibility of such an alignment between Earth and Saturn. The discussion raises critical points about the improbability of global revisions to ancient traditions and the lack of supporting evidence in the mytho-historical record for such drastic shifts in celestial interpretations. The author stresses the importance of adhering to the recorded myths without altering their original meanings to fit new models, arguing against the rationalizations presented by other scholars like Lynn Rose.",
