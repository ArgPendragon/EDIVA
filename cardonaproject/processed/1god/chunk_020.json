And here another objection may be raised because such shuffling around would be seen by some as violating Bode’s Law, to say nothing of the stability of the Solar System. References concerning the belief in the immutability of the Solar System as a whole, and of its planets in particular, are not required since this one-time verity has been vouched for by many an astronomer and astrophysicist since the dawn of modern astronomical observation. It will be pointed out, for instance, that Simon Laplace (1749-1827) mathematically proved the near-eternal stability of the planets of the Solar System, a work that was carried forward and supposedly improved upon by Joseph Lagrange and Siméon Poisson. In studying the work of Laplace, however, we find that what he presented was turned into a uniformitarian dogma against his intentions. Regardless of what historians of science have made of his so-called proofs, he himself was not averse to celestial disorder. “The sky itself, despite the orderliness of its movements,” he wrote, “is not unalterable.” As far as he was concerned, the stability of the present system is itself “disturbed by various causes that can be ascertained by careful analysis, but which are impossible to frame within a calculation.” More than that, he found himself wondering whether the heavenly bodies of the Solar System might be affected by forces other than gravitation, that is whether electric and magnetic energies might also play a role. As Peter Warlow described the matter: “...the first thing we must say here is that, contrary to an often-repeated statement, no one has ever proved that the Solar System has been, or will be, stable for any significant length of time. The statement has its beginnings about two hundred years ago, and stems from the work of the Marquis de Laplace, who spent much of his life working out a mathematical model for the Solar System. The model was based on the assumption that Newton was right in attributing all of the motions to the effect of gravity alone, and it was limited to a consideration of the major bodies alone—the main planetary bodies plus the Sun. The thirty or so other major bodies [since then many more], in the form of the main satellites of the planets, were ignored.” And: “Laplace, himself, fully appreciated the limitations of his model, and he recognized that it was quite possible for the system to become disturbed, either as a result of the appearance of a new body into the system, or by some change of the bodies already within the system. Indeed, it would probably be appropriate to class him as a catastrophist, and it is rather ironic that his name has been taken so much in vain by uniformitarians.",

            "content": "This, however, is not the place to review the impetus that Laplace’s mathematics had on those astronomers who came later and the extent to which they saw fit to reinterpret his work in order to force-fit it into their uniformitarian, and even religious, prejudices. As we will soon see, belief in this matter has changed considerably since the days of Laplace. V. Szebehely and R. McKenzie have contested G. Hills’ much earlier postulate of a stable Sun-Earth-Moon system, and have themselves reached the conclusion that the Moon may someday escape from Earth to become itself a planet. Thus, if the Moon can yet escape Earth’s attraction to become an independent planet, what is so bizarre about another satellite, in this instance Earth itself, escaping the clutches of Saturn to become the autonomous planet it now is? The Moon, however, is not the only celestial body in our system that has recently been calculated to be capable of an orbital change. Computer simulations by Gerald Sussman have indicated that the orbits of the inner four planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are unstable and liable to future orbital changes. Doug Lin had also suggested as far back as 1982 “that planets like Jupiter could migrate from the outer solar system in toward their parent stars.” While these are processes thought to take millions of years, the important thing to remember, for the time being, is that the new Science of Chaos shows beyond a reasonable doubt that the Solar System is not the “paragon of predictability that was once imagined,” and that Laplace’s deterministic world view no longer holds. What now turns up is that resonance pervades the Solar System and that it probably acts through tidal effects. As further computer retrocalculations conducted by Archie Roy and his team have shown, the orbits of the smaller bodies of the Solar System are actually chaotic and unpredictable. In a study of planetary perturbations performed by John Bagby, it was found that such computer simulations as the ones described above are not, of themselves, reliable beyond a certain length of time. As he stated: “I found that every outer planet all the way in to at least Mars was so perturbed by some as yet unmodeled cause that their orbits needed to be recalculated every ten years.”",

            "content": "Bagby himself reached the conclusion that a tenth planet, dubbed “X,” or a stellar companion, orbited the Sun beyond the orbit of Uranus, and that it was this massive object that was causing the perturbations of the outer planets. But while Bagby’s Planet “X” has yet to materialize, the perturbations of the outer planets remain real.\n\nTHE TITIUS-BODE LAW\nBut what, one might ask, of the spacing between the planetary orbits dictated by Bode’s Law? Would this law not be violated had Earth once been a satellite of Saturn?\n\nBode’s Law was actually discovered by Johann Daniel Titius of Wittenberg, Germany, in 1772. But because it was brought to prominence by Johann Elert Bode, another German astronomer—some say actually stolen by him—it has become known by his name.\n\nWhat is this law?\nIn order of distances, the planets of the Solar System moving outward from the Sun are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. What Titius discovered was that if we take the number 3, double it, then double the result, and keep on doubling in that manner, we end up with the series 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, etc. Adding 4 to each of these numbers results in the series 7, 10, 16, 28, 52, 100, etc. If we then divide each of these numbers by 10, we finally end up with -7, 1, 1-6, 2-8, 5-2, 10, and so on. What is extraordinary about this final series is that it turns out to be in fair agreement with the actual mean distances of each planet from the Sun, still moving outward, when measured in astronomical units. Where this law was at first thought to fail was in its fourth placement, since there is no planet to be found at 2-8 astronomical units from the Sun. But then, when the asteroid belt was discovered between Mars and Jupiter close enough to this position, Bode’s Law became engraved in granite—never mind that the law breaks completely down when it comes to Neptune and Pluto. It was then “established” that the effects of this law had manifested themselves early in the history of the Solar System. But, in 1960, Robert Bass demonstrated mathematically that planets tend to space themselves in a Bode’s Law type series of orbits, by what he termed the Principle of Least Mean Potential Energy, even if initially disturbed. Thus the Bode formula—for that is all it really is—reveals absolutely nothing about the original spacing of the Solar System planets. This was validated in 1968 by the then Soviet theoretician A. M. Molchanov, who claimed that Bode’s Law is actually the result of orbital resonances and that it could not be of primeval origin. This was again stressed seven years later by Michael Ovenden, who renamed Bass’ earlier axiom as the Principle of Least Interaction Action, when he reached a conclusion identical to Molchanov’s—“that the present distribution of the planetary and satellite orbits is the result of mutual perturbations.",

            "content": "What can be determined from all this is that “the present distribution gives no information concerning the origin of the solar system.” In 1970, J. G. Hills computed simulations of the N-body problem and discovered that “arbitrary planetary configurations, started with purely random initial positions and velocities, tend, during a few thousand to a few hundred thousand subsequent years, to ‘relax’ into a Bode’s-law type of resonant configuration.” So much, then, for “millions of years.” Now it is true that the planetary system that relaxed the fastest in Hills’ simulations, at something like 2000 years, consisted of the Sun with four planets, each of which contained ten times the mass of the Jovian planets—hardly a portrait of our Solar System. However, the actual planetary composition of this simulation is not the central issue being discussed here. What is important to keep in mind is that Hills showed that, under certain conditions, planets can relax into a Bode’s Law type of configuration within a comparatively short time. And this is important because, up to then, this had generally been thought to be impossible—which, if nothing else, proves that what is thought to be impossible in astronomy today may be thought of as being quite possible tomorrow. Actually, as Bass informed his readers in 1974, the phenomenon discovered by Hills was foreseen by Emest Brown as early as 1931 but no one seems to have paid him any heed. What all this implies is that Bode’s Law is an empiricism based on the present spacing of the planets. Lynn Rose explained it best: “It is usually not the case that mathematical gimmickry comes first, and that an inventory of the heavens is taken later. Usually the heavenly body count comes first, and the tissue of mathematical rationalization is developed later. Thus Kepler first considered that there were six bodies orbiting the Sun—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn [since the rest had not yet been discovered]—and then invented his scheme involving the five regular solids to explain why there could be only those six bodies. And in the eighteenth century, when Titius was working on his law and Bode was stealing it, the properties of the known bodies were examined first, and then the artificial mathematical formula—now known as ‘Bode’s Law’—was developed in an effort to rationalize what was already known. In fact, one of the most reputable encyclopedias of astronomy has it stated that “the Titius-Bode Law...is most probably a mere coincidence.” Be that as it may, when it comes to the actual Solar System, Hills’ above-described model suggested to him that a reasonable estimate for the relaxation of the Jovian planets into their present orbits would be between 100,000 and a million years. Thus, while it may be pointed out that Bass himself was more concerned with the orbital crossings of an erratic Venus as proposed by Immanuel Velikovsky, which does not concern us here, than he was with the Jovian giants, Hills’ conclusion may be said to bode disaster for the Saturnian scenario being proposed here. After all, a hundred thousand to a million years would hardly place our posited event within human memory.",

            "content": "What must not be lost track of, however, is that these computer simulations, as well as Ovenden’s calculations, involve point-particle (or point-mass) motions and not those of semi-rigid solid bodies. This, also, is important because, according to point-particle Newtonian mechanics, the relaxation of planets into resonant orbits would be reversible. It was for this reason that, despite Ovenden’s own disclaimer, Bass suggested the inclusion of tidal friction as this would be one way of breaking this reversing tendency. Hills, as later Ovenden, saw no reason to take this drag into consideration. Had they done so, their results would have been entirely different. As Bass indicated, the addition of tidal friction “could put the planets onto vastly different orbits.” Personally, I will not claim that tidal friction, or tidal friction alone, would resolve the Saturnian problem. In the meantime, however, it should be kept in mind that Bass was not relying on Hills’ discovery as much as he was on an adaptation of it. Eventually, Ovenden’s Principle of Least Interaction Action failed in predicting the present orbits of the Jovian planets. Ovenden could only save his Principle by postulating the one-time existence of an additional massive object and then getting rid of it at some point in time. According to this postulate—which, at first glance, should seem wilder than the one being proposed in this work—the Solar System has still not reached equilibrium, which reminds us very much of Bagby’s postulate concerning his undiscovered planet as the cause for planetary perturbations. Ovenden placed the catastrophe which got rid of his one-time planet at 16 million (1.6 x 107) years ago, while also stating that it would take something like another 280 million (2.8 x 108) years for the Solar System to reach complete equilibrium (thus allowing his Principle of Least Interaction Action to fulfill itself). Since, however, I am here only concerned with the past and present orbits of the planets, Ovenden’s 280 million years of future orbital re-adjustments are irrelevant to our case. But we will note that, according to Ovenden, the present near-equilibrium of the Solar System is not its final stage—that, in fact, the Solar System is still adjusting to a relatively recent planetary shuffle. Needless to say, it will again be pointed out that an event which supposedly occurred 16 million years ago is hardly “recent.” But let us not get carried away just yet because one thing that Ovenden himself stressed takes the wind out of the above objection. “...if it can be shown that processes operate within the solar system that can rearrange the planetary orbits on a sufficiently short time-scale then we must conclude that the present distribution of planetary and satellite orbits contains no information about conditions at the time of formation of the solar system.”",

            "content": "Ovenden himself went even further when he theorized that the close approach of planets to each other is not only possible but possibly inherent in the very nature of the cosmos. From this he also reached the conclusion that “a system of planets (or satellites) will change its configuration slowly when the planets are far apart” but “quickly when they are close together and interacting violently.” This brings us to W. M. Smart who, in 1953, had already understood that such “perturbation series” could not be relied upon except for a very short time—one or two centuries, to be exact. Later, Bass demonstrated that: “...it is perfectly possible, according to Newton’s Laws of Dynamics and Gravitation when three or more bodies are involved, for planets to nearly collide and then relax into an apparently stable Bode’ Law type of configuration within a relatively short time.” Moreover, by “a relatively short time,” Bass meant “in a few centuries.” If it can therefore be shown that the planets approached and interacted with each other during the age of man, the resonances inherent in Bode’s Law will not admit to dating in millions of years. And, on this issue, the historical record seems to be clear enough, even if still unrecognized by most conventionalists. RETROACTIVE CALCULATIONS What then of retroactive calculations (or retrocalculations, for short)? Retrocalculation “is the method which relies on the assumption that the Earth has been behaving in a nice sedate uniformitarian manner, and it is assumed that it is possible to calculate backwards in time to establish the exact date of astronomical events.” Do not such calculations prove that no change in the orbits or placements of the planets have taken place in the past? No, they do not. As Leroy Ellenberger indicated when he was still a Velikovskian catastrophist: “No retro-calculations to date have been inherently capable of duplicating near-collisions (among the planets) even if one occurred.” William Mullen, too, observed that such retrocalculations are futile since they involve “a problem rather like taking the position of a few billiard-balls towards the end of the game and calculating the positions of the complete set back to the beginning.” Or, as Warlow pointed out: “In fact, as far as the stability of the system is concerned, there are experts in the field today who admit that if we take the system in its present state, it is only reasonable to calculate forward or backward in time for about three hundred years before we reach a level of unacceptable uncertainty.",

However,” he continues, “they would admit that there is much we do not understand.” The astronomers Victor Clube and Bill Napier are of the same mind: “Unfortunately,” they wrote, “it is not generally possible to calculate past and future orbits in great detail, small uncertainties magnifying rapidly. Most calculations involving three or more solar system bodies are unreliable beyond a few hundred years.” Or, as Jill Abery succinctly phrased it: “Forget all those old computer calculations of past and future behaviour of the Solar System. Mathematicians now realise that the system is too complicated for conventional computers to ever come up with the right answer. However, they have a new mathematical system which ignores the laws of motion in our familiar 3-dimensional space. Interestingly, it demonstrates that the Solar System’s behaviour is very chaotic with many possible scenarios.” Let us not forget the words of astronomer Archie Roy, reviewed above, to the effect that “numerical integrations backward in time could take the system, still well behaved, through the episode of wild behaviour as if it had never been.”",

I can say this with confidence because they themselves have not been exactly averse to postulating scenarios in which orbital paths are shown to be capable of change. Among them, Thomas Van Flandern came close to an unheard-of sensationalism when he wrote: “We are only now beginning to see the Universe as a place of constant change with a rich and varied history and as the site of a great many unique events that continue to this day. Mercury, for example, may once have been a satellite of Venus that, in the not-so-distant past, escaped. Whether or not this happened, it is clear that some event caused Venus to spin in a different direction and at a slower speed than any other planet. Both satellites of Mars and most of Jupiter’s did not originate with those planets but also seem to have been captured relatively recently. Saturn’s rings could be yet another example of the solar system’s dynamism. Were they once a satellite that broke apart? What event tilted Uranus on its side? What disrupted the existing satellites of Neptune? Could the planet Pluto be an escaped satellite of Neptune? If so, how did Pluto get its own satellite? Where did the newly discovered minor planet Chiron, whose unstable orbit crosses those of Saturn and Uranus, come from?",

            "content": "Robert Harrington, a colleague of Van Flandern, has also proposed the idea that Mercury originated as an escaped satellite of Venus early in the formation of the solar system. As Philip Burns stated: “This doesn’t appear to have garnered a lot of support, but on the other hand, I don’t think it’s been refuted, either. The ‘Mercury as Venus’s Moon’ theory explains at one stroke many observations, such as the reduced/reversed spin of Venus, its massive atmosphere, the 2/3 spin resonance of Mercury, the oblate shape of Mercury, and many more.” George Wetherhill posited an even wilder scenario for Mercury in which the planet had originally orbited the Sun at Earth’s present distance. Then, according to this particular theory, Mercury was involved in a violent collision in which the planet was melted. A second collision then resulted in the stripping away of Mercury’s crust and its ejection out of its orbit. Deflected from its path by Earth’s gravity field, together with that of Venus, Mercury eventually settled down into its present circular track. Alan Stern, on the other hand, came out with a proposition of satellite capture, rather than escape. Not that the capture of satellites by planets had not been propounded before. But this one deals with the planet Neptune and its companion, Triton, a moon the size of the planet Pluto. Triton, it was found out, orbits Neptune in what astronomers call “the wrong direction,” that is clockwise as seen from “above,” when all other satellites revolve counterclockwise. The most likely explanation for this, according to Stern, is that Triton had once orbited freely but, passing too close to Neptune, was captured by the larger planet as its moon. So, similarly, with the planet Pluto which, until 1978, was still believed to be without a moon. But a later ground-based photograph of Pluto revealed the presence of a satellite—since then named Charon—orbiting the planet. Because Charon is larger than our Moon, and one third as large as Pluto itself, Stern has said that it is “really more accurate to call this a double planet.” Stern is thus of the opinion that these two planets had also once orbited freely but that, coming too close, they managed to capture each other. But what of Earth itself? Has anyone before us ever posited that it, too, may have shifted?",
