This god, as well as his son, is also known as Efe, from whom the tribe derived its name; but Efe the father was also Saturn. The planet itself is also known by them as Bibi Deba—the good or perfect star. As we have already noted in a previous chapter, hemmed in as they are by the almost impenetrable jungles of the Congo, these pygmies know that Saturn is surrounded by satellites, for which reason they also allude to the planet as Bibi Tiba Abutsiua’ani—the star of nine moons. The greatest calamity that these diminutive but highly intelligent people remember is that of a universal flood—which gives the lie to those mythologists who claim that Deluge myths are unknown from Africa—and even this they associate with Efe/Saturn. But what then of non-planetary disasters, of ordinary floods, famines, and thunder, and wind, etc.? True—man did imbue these non-planetary forces with a will of their own and, yes, they often anthropomorphized them. This holds true not only for those forces which terrified early man but also for those aspects of nature that were passive, beautiful, and even.",

            "content": "benign—such as fog, the northern lights, and even fair weather, to give but a few examples.\n\nThus de Santillana and von Dechend were not entirely correct when they stated that “all the stories, characters and adventures narrated by mythology concentrate on the active powers among the stars, who are the planets.” Regardless of the impetus behind its origin, a fair share of primitive mythology does concern itself with non-planetary spirits of nature.\n\nWe notice, however, that these spirits of nature, a few among which have been mentioned above, were not deified—that is they were not regarded as demiurges with powers over the destiny of man. Only among the more sophisticated Incas, long out of primitiveness, was Thunder, for instance, considered something of a deity, and even then he was subservient to the Creator. And there, I must stress, lies the difference, because, according to his own statements, ancient man was not concerned with the purported antics of fog, fair weather, or other nature spirits, demons, and fairies. What concerns us in this study are the great deities of mankind—the creators and destroyers, the movers of the world—which we find imbuing the religions and cosmic beliefs of early civilizations and primitive tribes alike.\n\nAgain, I am not attempting to negate the fact that so-called primitive cultures perceive the world as being spirit animated. But what of it? Until a few hundred years ago, were not the most sophisticated centers of European civilization also imbued with superstition, which is what a spirit-animated belief amounts to? Are countries like China and India, Indonesia, and heaven knows where else, not superstition-ridden to this day? Do they not still throw live chickens into volcanic craters in Java, and pour gin, in lieu of awa, to Pele in America’s fiftieth state, as endeavors meant to pacify the destructive force exhibited by volcanoes? Does any of this negate the fact that the countries in question also pay homage to a higher deity dictated by whatever religion these societies adhere to? Why, then, could not primitive planetary worship have co-existed with a more down-to-earth animism?\n\nAs research implies, residual planetary worship continues to saturate the most primitive beliefs up to the present, as exemplified by the religion of the Efe pygmies mentioned above. Nor must this particular example be viewed as unique. Space does not here permit anything close to a fair sampling of such cases but I could easily have included a catalogue of similar residues found embedded in the beliefs of such people as the Dogon of the Sudan, which is present-day Mali, the astronomical lore of whom we have already discussed in a previous chapter; the Negroes of Mozambique; the Bambala of the Congo; the Bushongo; and many other tribes from the African heartland. The mythology of Oceania is likewise saturated with residual planetary worship as is that of the Inuit from Alaska to Greenland. None of these primitive societies, and others like them, can be said to be astronomically adept, yet, when traced to their basic fundamentals, the roots of their religious beliefs exhibit an uncanny similarity to the planetary motifs found scattered among the more sophisticated early civilizations of man. True, demons and nature spirits also abound, but none of these play a cosmogonic role or hold a prominent place in the complex religious rituals performed by these societies.\n\nStudents of religion will tell us that logic dictates that man would have first endowed what he could see around him with spiritual life before he would have done likewise with the far away planets. But, in that case, should he not have looked upon the Sun and the Moon as.",

            "content": "part of his all-surrounding environment? Could he then have believed that rivers and trees and wind and thunder were animated by spirits before he believed similarly of the most comforting object he was aware of—the Sun?\n\nGiven that the Sun and the Moon are much more conspicuous than the planets, theirs should have been the major role in primitive mythology. How is it then that, while not always readily obvious from cursory studies, the prime protagonists were invariably the planets and planet-induced phenomena?\n\nThis poses something of a conundrum to those who view mythology through uniformitarian eyes, one that has already been commented on by Immanuel Velikovsky and David Talbott. The riddle, however, is solved when we discover, as in fact the sources themselves convincingly illustrate, that the planets, or at least some of them, prime among them the planet Saturn, were once more conspicuous than Sun and Moon.\n\nOnce this is accepted, as it is by an ever-growing body of neo-catastrophists, it becomes much easier to accept that before man had developed an awareness of the heavenly bodies, he had no gods at all.\n\nThis would seem to lead to the assumption that early man lived for long ages before he discovered his first god but the fruits of research indicate otherwise. In the first place, one must stop thinking of the planets in this instance as mere pin-points of light in the night sky. It should by now have become obvious to the readers of this work that man’s earliest memory of the planets is one that hints at recognizable orbs hanging low in the sky.\n\nAs we have thus far seen, originally there seems to have been only one such orb visible in the sky—the planet Saturn. Mankind, it now seems, discovered its identity under the close influence of this planetary body which is why the Saturnian deity, in his many guises, is to be found at the head of every major pantheon throughout the ancient civilized world.\n\nThis primeval Saturn entered man’s memory first as a passive entity which was originally looked upon with neither fear nor awe. But, as I intend to show in a future work, this was not to remain so. In time, a series of events transpired which so impressed the human mind that Saturn became, for man, the very centre of his environment, his ever-increasing awe and, eventually, the deduced reason for his very being. Given all this, while not wishing to borrow credence, what would be so difficult in accepting that (a) man’s original deity was a planetary body and that (b) prime among these deified bodies was the planet Saturn?\n\nThe question, of course, is simply this: Is there any proof that any of this transpired? So let me be quite honest. If proof is what we are after, it is not forthcoming—any more than proof to the contrary is. But the evidence now at hand, which we shall continue to present, is more than enough to upset antiquated views of man’s emergence as a religious being and quite capable of upholding this new, if revolutionary, theory.\n\nFurther evidence concerning our proposition that, during the indeterminate period with which we are concerned, Saturn was the only celestial body visible from Earth will be presented in following chapters. In the meantime, it is again time to reshuffle our previous set of hypotheses while incorporating this new datum in the set. Our hypotheses, then, will read as follows:",

            "content": "Chapter 9\nThe Immobile God\nTHE SABBATH STAR\n\nIn Chapter 4 we claimed that the Hebrew name for the planet Saturn, that is Shabtai, was responsible for the naming of the Sabbath, in Hebrew Shabbath, the Saturday of the Jews. As we also noted in that same chapter, the word Shabbath is sometimes said to derive from the closely related shabath, which means “to repose” or “to rest.” This meaning, in turn, has been said to have arisen because Elohim rested from his work of Creation on that day. What is indicated by this is that Elohim’s rest came first, for which the Sabbath was then named. It seems, however, that there is more to this “resting” business than meets the eye. Or why would the planet in question have been named for that particular day, thus also receiving the meaning of “rest”?\n\nThe connection of Saturn with the Creation is not restricted to Hebrew tradition. In Chapter 4, we also had occasion to mention a similar tradition as believed in by the Persians. We repeat that tradition here as recorded by Al-Biruni:\n\n“On the 6th day of Farwardin, the day Khurdadh, is the great Nauroz, for the Persians a feast of great importance. On this day—they say—God finished the creation, for it is the last of the six days... On this day God created Saturn...”\n\nWhat did the planet Saturn have to do with Creation or the resting of Elohim? Why was Saturn known as the Lord of the Sabbath?\n\nOne of the strange things about the Sabbath is that it is the only day to which the Israelites gave a name. The rest of the days of the week were called by their ordinal numbers.\n\nWhy this exception? Why was Saturn of importance even to the ancient Hebrews? Not that, in later times, they were overly proud of this. In fact, as William Heidel informs us, they resented the identification of the Sabbath with Saturn’s day for long afterwards.\n\nThat Shabtai, sometimes referred to as Kokab Sabet, also called the Sabbath Star, meant “the resting Star or Planet” is well known. In his attempt to connect the order of Creation, day by day, as described in the Book of Genesis, with the different planetary deities honored traditionally on the successive days of the seven-day week, Robert Graves, as usual,",

The reading “the suka of your Moloch” is rendered as “Siccuth your melek” —that is, “Siccuth your king.” This, in turn, was based on the assumption that Siccuth is the same name of the Assyrian god Sakkuth.\n\nThe Masoretic version is thus interpreted this way: In his accusation of Israel, Amos condemns the people to carry these idols, Sikut and Chiun, with them into the coming Babylonian exile as punishment for having worshipped them in his day.\n\nWe will not here enter into a discussion concerning which version is to be preferred. To us, whether Chiun was worshipped by the Israelites during the time of Moses or the days of Amos does not change the fact that the Israelites did worship this god.

            "content": "Reminiscence of a Hebrew word meaning “the shades,” but it is more than probable that the name Remphan is nothing but a mistransliteration into Greek of the same Chiun in the King James version of Amos.\n\nJerome interpreted the star of Chiun as Lucifer, which is popularly, but erroneously, believed to have stood for the planet Venus. But as Martin Sieff correctly stated, Chiun was the Assyrian name for Saturn, the same as the Syriac Kewan (and the very Hebrew Khevan).\n\nOne question that comes to mind at this point is: What were the Israelites doing running about the desert with the image of the Saturnian star in their tabernacle?\n\nLet us be honest: Present Jewish and Christian sentiments notwithstanding, it has long been known that Saturn was the god of the Jews. In more recent years, for instance, Carl Jung knew very well that Saturn was the star of Israel. Much earlier, Aurelius Augustinus was more explicit when he informed his readers that the ancients considered the planet Saturn as their god. Throughout the Middle Ages, the Jews were largely known as the People of Saturn (as so, incidentally, were the Scythians). This belief, however, is much older than that since even the Roman historian Tacitus (c. A.D. 55-117) described the Jews as worshipping the planet Saturn as their god.\n\nWhether the tabernacle in question was the acclaimed one that Moses was said to have had constructed, and in which the famed ark of the covenant was housed, remains a moot question. This much, however, should be stated: While the tabernacle which Moses had had built is usually referred to as the Mishkan and/or the Ohel, the tabernacle mentioned in the Hebrew version of Amos is simply called sukot, the plural of suka, meaning “tents.”\n\nTHE TROUBLE WITH AMOS\n\nScholars of the Jewish faith have, naturally enough, found much to criticize in the above interpretation of the Amosian verse in question. As it has been said, this “is a difficult verse and the subject of very diverse interpretation” —or, as M. Weinfeld put it, a verse on which many a pen has been broken,” (although, in my opinion, his has fared no better). This difficulty is not abated by the fact that the Hebrew —that is Masoretic—version of the passage in question replaces Moloch with Siccuth (or Sikut, Sikkut) while placing the event as coming in the future rather than having occurred in the past. Thus: “So shall you take up Siccuth your king and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.”",
