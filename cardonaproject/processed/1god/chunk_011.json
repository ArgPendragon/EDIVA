            "content": "which lists 405 synodic months during some 33 years of observation. The manuscript also presents a table of 69 possible dates of future solar eclipses. The Evening Star, Venus, with its irregular course, the first to appear and the last to fade, caught their eye. The Maya strived to measure its height, which varies at sunrise and sunset... All of these preoccupations, which went far beyond those required to compile an agrarian calendar, showed their obsessive interest in infinity—whether of time or space—and also an anxiety in the face of the passage of time.\n\nThe astronomical observations of the Maya were so precise that the figures they arrived at in computing the solar year were not only more accurate than the Julian year, but, as some have claimed, also more accurate than the Gregorian year, which was introduced into Europe in 1582 and remains the calendar year until the present.\n\nMesoamerican calendars were not produced by any one person in any single generation. Their development and refinement was the product of centuries. In fact, their basic elements can be traced as far back as the Olmec, who had established their cities and ceremonial centres in Mexico’s Gulf Coast “at least as early as the second century B. C.” In time—pun intended—these calendars evolved into an intricate system in which several different time cycles, all of which were calculated independently and with similar exactitude, were incorporated in various combinations, relating one cycle to another, in their utilization of time measurement.\n\nOne particular calendar employed by the Maya, called Haab, was based on a 360-day count and was divided into 18 months of 20 days each, to which five days—believed to be “malefic, ill-omened, empty, and nameless”—were added at the end to bring the year to a total of 365 days.\n\nWhile the 365-day calendar, which in time became the common property of all Mesoamerican peoples, has been attested in inscriptions as early as 667 B.C. Edmonson tells us that the 360-day calendar did not come into use by the Olmecs earlier than the first century B.C., that is, some 300 years after the inauguration of the 365-day one. I mention this here in passing because, if Edmonson is correct, Immanuel Velikovsky’s contention that the 365-day calendar followed the 360-day one has to be wrong.\n\nA somewhat simpler, but more mysterious, calendar, said to have been called Tzolkin by the Maya, but Tonalamatl by the Aztecs, was composed of 260 days divided into 13 months of 20 days each. Usually referred to as the sacred calendar because it was used to keep the religious festivals in line with the proper seasons, the Tzolkin has been demoted to a mere divinatory program by students of Mesoamerican culture.\n\nMore recently, Vincent Malmstrém has attempted to show that this 260-day calendar was actually even older than the Maya. Said to have been originally developed for agrarian purposes, Malmstrém contends that this calendar owed its origin to the Zoque of Mexico’s Pacific coastal plain and that it marks the interval between passages of the Sun at its zenith over",

            "content": "the Zoque’s ceremonial center at Izapa. Developed in the fourteenth century B.C., the calendar passed on to the Olmec of the Gulf Coast and, from there, to the Maya in the east and the plateau of Mexico in the west. Whether Malmstrom has come across a red herring, and/or whether Mayanists will ever accept his conclusions, as of this writing remains to be seen. One thing that can be stated for certain is that the synchronization of this calendar with the 360-day one occurred once every 18,980 days, which makes for 52 years. This is the same time period we have already encountered as separating the ceremony known as the Binding of the Years, which began at the midnight transit of the Pleiades constellation.\n\nThe Mesoamericans also devised a lunar calendar which fitted into their other time-keeping devices. The lunar period of 29.53 days that they obtained contained a mere discrepancy of only .112 of a day.\n\nThe Dresden Codex not only includes the perpetual lunar calendar mentioned above, but also a table of new moons to be used for the prediction of solar eclipses.\n\nVENUS\n\nOf all the celestial bodies that the Mesoamericans observed, the planet Venus seems without doubt to have been considered the most important. Called, among other things, the Great, or Ancient, Star, it is repeatedly alluded to in the extant codices. Ramén y Zamora, who studied the lore of the Mexican tribes only a few decades after the re-discovery of America, was astounded to discover that the Indians kept a precise record of the appearances of this planet. “So accurately did they keep the record of the days when it appeared and disappeared,” he wrote, “that they never made a mistake.”” Toribo Motolina added that “they knew on what day it would appear again in the east after it had lost itself or disappeared in the west” and that “they counted the days by this star and yielded reverence and offered sacrifices to it.””",

The Maya were also aware of the commensurability between this 584-day Venus “year” and the so-called vague year of 365 days. They knew that eight vague years were exactly equal to five Venus “years.” The equivalent number of days, which comes out to 2,920, is a figure which turns up repeatedly in their Venus tables. They had quite correctly calculated that Venus returns to almost the exact same spot in the sky, almost at the same time of the year, every 2,920 days.\n\nMeanwhile, a relatively new manuscript, which has been dubbed the Grolier Codex, surfaced in 1971. Michael Coe has determined that, like the Dresden Codex, the extant eleven pages of this manuscript illustrate the exact same spot at almost the same time of the year, every 2,920 days. The codex predicts the appearance and disappearance of Venus in a great cycle of 845 revolutions equal to 1352 years; and after completion, the cycle repeats itself endlessly by a shift in the order of the lines and the way they are to be displayed as the world’s first and only perpetual calendar of Venus ever produced by any civilization.” According to Charles Lacombe, “this ancient Mayan document must rank among the supreme intellectual achievements of human history.”\n\n“The codex predicts the appearance and disappearance of Venus in a great cycle of...",

It is easily forgotten by the layman that one cannot easily view the Sun directly without some form of optic protection except during its risings and settings. Of course, it could also be argued that the Chinese, who were so adept at just about everything, could have utilized dark, or smoked, glass in order to enable them to view sunspots. Actually, not even a smoked glass would have been necessary. Despite the fact that the Sun cannot be viewed directly for any length of time with the unaided eye, it can be viewed indirectly when it is shielded by haze or thin clouds. As John Gribbin noted, it is hardly surprising that those Chinese records which mention sunspots “very often comment at the same time that the brightness of the Sun was reduced.” As Gribbin explained: “This does not imply that the Sun itself was dim, but that dust or haze in the atmosphere was obscuring its light and making it possible to pick out the spots against the glare of the solar disk.”® Had sunspots been as easily detected with the unaided eye as some would think, it would not, in Europe, have taken till the early seventeenth century for them to be re-discovered. One of the reasons why Galileo was persecuted by the Catholic Church was his insistence that the Sun often exhibits such blemishes on its surface. Prior to that, one of the central dogmas of the Church was that the Sun, having been created by God, had to be a perfect sphere. “[S]uggesting imperfection in the Sun was seen in some quarters as implying that God could be fallible and was guilty of shoddy workmanship.”” And yet, even before the Chinese, sunspots had long been known to the ancient Greeks.\n\nTHE ETERNAL PLANET\n\nThe caliber of ancient Chinese astronomy can inter alia be judged by what the imperial astronomers were able to discover about the planets. Here I do not wish to bore the lay reader with too many technicalities, so I will merely zero in on what the Chinese had to say concerning the planet Saturn, the astronomical name of which was T’ien-Sing, which means “Eternal Planet.” The slowness of this body in its course around the Sun, for instance, was described by them in this manner:\n“This planet, with its slow and heavy walk, imitating age, drags itself along its path, in a manner of speaking; before finishing its revolution, it had seen a great number of men die whom it had seen being born, so slow was its pace.”®",
