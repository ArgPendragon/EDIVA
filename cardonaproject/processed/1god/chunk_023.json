            "content": "Jerusalem, but also as Bét (or Bit) Sulman. The designation 'House' —i.e. Bét(h)—for cities in Palestine is, of course, quite common. Easily coming to mind are such cities as Beth-aven, Beth-El, Bethlehem, Beth-haran, Bethshemesh, Beth-horon, Beth-eden (in Syria), Beth-peor, and Beth-shan, among many others. Lewy himself explains such place names as due to the one-time existence of sanctuaries each of which was dedicated to the deity there named. Thus, Jerusalem would have been referred to as Beth Shulman because a temple of Shulman would have existed there. Lewy’s conclusion was that a temple of Shulman supplanted an earlier one dedicated to Shalim, but that it did not last for long. During the same period, the name of the city changed from Urusalim to Bet Shulman; however, with the destruction of the Shulman temple, the name reverted back to Urusalim. This would explain why the name Bet Shulman never became popular. Needless to say, this was all conjecture on Lewy’s part. For one thing, Lewy himself accepted that Shalim and Shulman(u) were slightly different versions of the same deity, so that no replacement of sanctuaries need enter the picture. Nor need the name Bet Shulman have ever supplanted that of Urusalim since, in effect, the meaning of both names is theologically, even if not philologically, synonymous—the former meaning 'House of Shulman,' the latter, as we have seen, 'Founded by Shalim.' It is thus more than possible that Bet Shulman was merely another designation for Urusalim, one derived from Assyrian, the other from Chaldean sources. The Chaldean name passed into Hebrew; the Assyrian did not. The one became popular; the other did not. In any case, whether called by the very name of the god (Salem); referred to as having been founded by him (Urusalim/Yerushalem); or simply called his city (Bet Shulman); it remains obvious that the city we call Jerusalem was named in honor and dedicated to the god Shalem/Shulman.",

            "content": "Outside of the Old Testament, we find this theophoric name adopted by Shalamanu, King of Moab. It also appears in the name of Shalmaneser, a name borne by more than one Assyrian king. Perhaps less known is the fact that Salummati was an epithet of the great Assurnasirpal. As a god, Shulman was worshipped in Nineveh and, under the variant Shulmanuha or Shulmanuhi, is found mentioned in Assyrian tablets. Shulman is known to have had a feminine counterpart named Shulmanitu—but also Shala. This goddess—but not Shulman—has been identified with Astarte and Ishtar, both personifications of the planet Venus. Moreover, Assyrian sources define Sulmanitu (the same as Shulmanitu) as distar Urusilimma, which Michael Astour has rendered 'IStar of Jerusalem.' The existence of this goddess in Jerusalem is verified by her laudation in the famous Song of Solomon in which she is referred to merely as the Shulammite. The sacrifices performed in Solomon’s temple were referred to in Hebrew as shelamim—the plural of shelem. Usually translated as 'peace offering(s),' R. de Vaux posits a different opinion, suggesting that shelamim 'implies the idea of a tribute offered to God...' If this is correct, then the god in question must originally have been Shalem. As they appear in cuneiform, the words salummatu and salummati are usually thought to signify 'brightness' and 'splendor,' respectively. As epithets, these descriptive terms were applied to Enlil (Saturn), Nergal (Mars), and Nabu (Mercury). On their own, they throw no light on the real identity of Shalem. Who, then, was this god? Very much like other names of Saturn, Shalem (or Salim) meant 'the Stable One.' Solomon’s name, 'belonging to Salim,' can then be interpreted as 'belonging to Saturn.' David, his father, must have been very partial to the Saturnian deity for not only did he name Solomon in his honor, but also his first-born son, Amnon, which means 'belonging to Amin—i.e. the Stable One,' and even his third, Absalom, which means 'the Father is Salim.' It can now safely be said that Jerusalem was the City of Saturn, a conclusion reached by Lewis Greenberg. Did not Isaiah himself refer to Jerusalem as the 'city of justice,' which justice, in Akkadian kittum, we have already found to be an epithet of Shamash/Saturn?",

Saying this, the sacrifices called shelamim which were offered in Solomon’s temple could only mean that the famous Israelite temple, as Hildegard Lewy showed in 1950, was really one dedicated to the planetary god Salim/Saturn. This is all the more true since the inner sanctum, that is, the Holy of Holies, of the temple was constructed in the shape of a cube, which was the characteristic shape of Saturnian temples. In fact, for some now forgotten reason, the cube had been a traditional representation of Saturn from ages past.",

(Adapted from plans drawn by Marie-Joséphe Devaux.) THE HOUSE OF SHULMAN. Further connections between Shalem/Shulman and Saturn can be derived from the el-Amara correspondence, letters written in Akkadian cuneiform dispatched to the Pharaoh Akhnaton and his father by the rulers of Palestine. In two of these letters, which Egyptologists have numbered 74 and 290, reference is made to a place which transliterators have rendered differently. In 1915, J. Knudtzon settled on the reading of this place as 'Bet Ninib'—i.e., House of Ninib. Some time later, in 1940, Julius Lewy re-read the name of this place as 'Bit Shulmanu'—House (or Sanctuary) of Shulman. William Albright did not accept Lewy’s transliteration, claiming that the ideogram which he read as 'Shulmanu' did not incorporate the determinative for divinity. In 1969, the team of Tadmor and Kalai re-read the ideogram again, this time as 'Beth Ninurta.' Which, then, was the correct reading?",

            "content": "Tadmor and Kalai’s reading of the place in question as Beth Ninurta was also correct. As we have already documented, Ninurta was also one of the names by which the planet Saturn was known. Lewy’s re-reading was based on an equation which is to be found in an Assyrian explanatory list of divine names. In this list, the Assyrians themselves equated 'NIN.IB' with 'DI.MES.' Just as 'NIN.IB' can be read as 'Ninurta,' so also can 'DI.MES' be read as 'Shulmanu.' It therefore follows that, like Ninib/Ninurta, with whom he was equated, Shulman was simply an alias of the planetary god Saturn. From this, it can be seen that all three readings—Bet Ninib, Beth Ninurta, and Bit Shulmanu—are correct. They all mean the same thing: 'House (or Sanctuary) of Saturn.' On the other hand, Albright was entirely wrong when he claimed that the name Shulman did not incorporate the determinative for divinity. The name Shulman, as it appears in el-Amarna letter 290, does incorporate the determinative 'dingir' for divinity. Lewy reproduced it by the usual transliteration—viz. 'Sulmani.' The equation of Shulman with Ninurta/Saturn, as revealed in the above, is of additional importance to the subject of this chapter because, very much like Shulman/Shalem, Ninurta was also considered an immobile god. Thus, in Akkadian, Ninurta was styled 'kaimanu', that is 'the steady star.'",

            "content": "The Egyptian explicitness When we come to Egypt, there is no longer any ambiguity concerning the Saturnian characteristic we have been investigating. In a hymn to Ra, the deity is addressed with these words: 'O thou firstborn, who dost lie without movement...' Here, once again, it remains for Egyptologists to explain why, if Ra was truly the Sun, it was described as lying 'without movement.' Ra, it was said, 'rests on his high place.' Atum was also said to have been immobile. Called 'the Firm Heart of the Sky,' it is distinctly said of him that 'the Great God lives fixed in the middle of the sky.' In the Papyrus of Ani, the deceased is addressed with these words: 'O thou who art without motion like unto Osiris!'—and this phrase is twice repeated. The immobility of Osiris is also mentioned in the Text of Teta: 'Thou art stable in thy name of 'Menu',' it is stated, where 'Menu' itself has the meaning of 'Stable One,' the very same epithet we have found attached to other Saturnian deities.",

Homage to thee...when thou risest on the horizon and sheddest thy beams of light...Homage to thee, O thou who risest in the horizon as Ra! How, then, can we reconcile the above passages, and many more like them, with the idea of a motionless Ra? Well, in the first place, the word translated as 'horizon' actually means 'light-land,' and while this term continues to be accepted as meaning 'horizon,' it should never have been. In the second place, the word translated as 'rises' actually means 'shines,' as Patricia Spencer indicated. There are various Egyptian words which carry these ambiguous meanings. Additionally, it is noted that there is an Egyptian word—'urt'—which has been rendered as meaning 'the setting of a star.' However, a related word—'urt-t'—actually means 'immobility,' while 'Urt' refers to 'a motionless god.' Egyptologists who have translated such phrases as 'O thou who risest in the horizon as Ra' did so because the words 'O thou who shines in the light-land' made little sense.",

We have also seen that the name of this god translates as 'the Stable One.' But what, then, is the connection between peace and stability? The Hebrew shalom derives from shalam, which means 'to be safe.' So, also, with the Maltese sliema which also means 'safety.' \"Peace' and 'safety' are allied terms but, in a sense, is not also 'stability'? Now, as it happens, the Egyptian word sharm’ means 'to be peaceful,' but also 'to be idle'—that is 'to be doing nothing,' which negates motion. Another Egyptian word meaning 'to be at peace' is heri, but heri also means 'to rest.' The Egyptian word most commonly used for 'to be at peace,' however, is hetep which also means 'to repose,' 'to rest,' and 'to be at rest.' This, then, raises the question: Given that Atum was described as being fixed in the middle of the sky, what is the logical characteristic to be allotted him when he is stated to have been em hetep—to have been at peace, or to have been at rest?",

Lynn Rose deduced that the bizarre astronomical system of Philolaos, the Pythagorean philosopher from Southern Italy, was merely a 'garbled' version of the primeval Saturnian system. This led him to conclude that the Central Fire of which Philolaos spoke was really an allusion to the old Saturnian sun.",
