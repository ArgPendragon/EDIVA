Ptah was the “greatest of all the old gods of Memphis” and, as Wallis Budge informs us, “his worship, in one form or another, goes back to the earliest part of the dynastic period.” He was referred to as “the very great god who came into being in the earliest time...father of fathers, Power of powers...father of beginnings...who created his own image, who fashioned his own body...the Disk of heaven...” and “the great god, who came into being in the beginning.”\n\n“O father of all the fathers of all the gods,” Ptah is lauded in one hymn, “thou Disk of heaven.” Usually understood as the disc of the Sun, but understood here as the disc of Saturn, this “Disk of heaven” is yet one more allusion to the fact that Saturn had been seen as a sizable orb, thus indicating its closer proximity to Earth. Ptah’s self-generation is again alluded to in no uncertain terms in another hymn in which he is lauded with the following.",

Thus, in yet one more famous Egyptian hymn, we find Osiris himself lauded as Ptah-Seker-Tem” (that is Ptah-Seker-Atum), which, as Budge maintained, is not only a form of Osiris but also “of the night sun.” Seker himself “was originally a power of darkness, or of the night” which “was identified with forms of the night sun like Tem [that is Atum].” “Under the name Ptah-",

            "content": "Seker-Asar, we [again] find Ptah and Seker united [and eventually identified] with Osiris... We are therefore not surprised to also find Ptah being remembered as “the splendid god who existed alone in the beginning.”\n\nWhat all the above implies, therefore, is that the god who personified the planet Saturn was believed to have come into being of his own accord and that, at least “in the beginning,” he was the only god in existence. No other deity existed with him or before him.\n\nPRAJAPATI\n\nWe have already seen the Indic Brahma, known as the “father of gods and men,” identified as Saturn through the name Brahmanyah. In that respect, it is noteworthy that Brahma is considered to have been the first of the Devas, which term is understood as meaning “deities,” but which, in effect, means the “shining ones,” an apt term for heavenly bodies. It is therefore telling that Brahma, too, was described as having originally been alone: “He hovers, alone, above everything.”\n\nAn epithet, usually translated to mean “Lord of Creatures,” by which Brahma was known is Prajapati.” This is so true that, in the Vishnu Purana, Prajapati is given as an additional name for Brahma.” Like others of the Saturnian deities we have been examining, Prajapati was also referred to as “the One God.”\n\nPrajapati’s identity as Saturn does not solely rely on that of Brahma. As the 11th century A.D. Arabian scholar, Al-Biruni, discovered during his travels in India, the Lord of Saturn is called Prajapati—pure and simple.\n\nIt should therefore not surprise us that, in distinction to Brahma, who was actually his own self, Prajapati was believed to have originally ruled alone. This we find in the Satapatha Brahmana which, among other matters, states that “Prajapati alone, indeed, existed here in the beginning.”\n\nFOUR FROM THE “PRIMITIVE” WORLD\n\nThe doctrinal conviction we have been investigating is to be found not only among the great faiths of the ancient world, but also among more primitive peoples.\n\nAmong the American Indians of the north-west, the creator was known as Raven. But here we have to differentiate between two Ravens. Most tales concerning Raven present this mysterious being as a shape-shifter and trickster who was often meddling with what had been created, even though he himself was also responsible for creating certain elements. As a meddler, shape-shifter, and trickster, Raven is identifiable as a personification of the planet",

            "content": "Mars. But as the prime creator of the cosmos,” Raven has to be identified as the planet Saturn.\n\nNow it is true that most myths do not differentiate between the two but, at least among the Eskimos and the Tlingit, the difference between them is remembered and indicated by the appearance of Raven Boy in addition to Raven.” Presented as the son of Raven,” it is Raven Boy who is there painted as the mischievous trickster.\n\nIn keeping with our present topic, note now the Haida creed as paraphrased by Helmut Hirnschall:\n\n“No one is exempt from loneliness, and the old and wise ones who teach the ways of living and tell stories at campfires say that even Raven, the Creator, knew the burden of loneliness.”\n\nIn order to have known “the burden of loneliness,” Raven had to have been alone—that is the only deity in existence. Through the rules of comparative mythology, it will have to be assumed that, in this instance, it is Raven/Saturn that is meant and not Raven Boy/Mars.\n\nHere we should also mention the Yuki creator whose name, Taiké-mol translates as “Solitude Walker.” There is no need to explain that a solitude walker walks alone and, in this Yuki myth, we are merely catching a glimpse of Raven in different guise.\n\nAccording to the Samoans, their creator, Tangaloa, who “lived in the far spaces,” was alone before there was heaven and earth.”\n\nAnd so, similarly, in a myth from New Hebrides where it is said that the creator, Naareau the Elder, “was the First of All.” Nothing was before him:” “He was in the void. There was only Naareau sitting in the void. Long he sat, and there was only he.”\n\nFOURTH INTERLUDE\n\nIt has been assumed by a bevy of students of religion that man’s concept of deity emerged out of the primitive fear our ancestors experienced in encountering the mysteries of nature around them. These mysteries, we are then told, were eventually explained through the slow and accumulating creation—invention, really —of invisible entities, spirits and demons, most of which were seen as being antagonistic to man. By the same token, natural phenomena, such as thunder and lightning, were anthropomorphized, that is given life, named, and even appealed to. In the end, we are told, even such natural items as vegetation and sexual",

            "content": "prowess became the recipients of animated embodiments which, little by little, evolved into gods.\n\nSome have claimed that man’s own ancestors, long dead, perhaps through the medium of dreams, were also vivified into ghosts, or lost souls, which were eventually incorporated into an ever evolving religious belief. Others insist that the ancient deities evolved out of a respect for certain historical persons of note—an old idea which has recently been gloriously revived by David Rohl in his sensational attempt to rewrite ancient history. Those who hold to this view usually point with pride to the Mesopotamian Gilgamesh, a supposed king of Uruk, and the Egyptian Imhotep, architect to King Djoser, as prime examples of their evidence. But that Gilgamesh was anything but a historical person has finally been established beyond a reasonable doubt, once and for all, by Ev Cochrane,” while the case of Imhotep is somewhat unique. The first builder of a pyramid—a stepped one to be sure—later dynasts were so impressed by Imhotep’s accomplishments that he was elevated to the stature of a god. This is not to be wondered at because, after all, the Egyptian pharaohs themselves were all looked upon as living gods. We do not, however, encounter Imhotep in any mythological themes, let alone any of a cosmogonic nature. For whatever it is worth, and Rohl notwithstanding, the belief that the ancient gods were really deified historical persons, never adhered to by many, is now accepted by even less. On the contrary, the reverse is true, in that some of the primeval deities were eventually demythologized and presented in human garb even by the ancients themselves.\n\nOur own hypothesis, as presented in this work, holds to the view that the concept of deity owes its origin to the planets, especially the planet Saturn, and not to such invented spirits, ghosts, demons, or historical persons as described above. I am not here asserting that the mysteries of everyday life, as they pertained to our primitive forebears, were not conducive of the myth-making process. But to say that our ancestors were more concerned with the threatening character of everyday life, such as flood, famine, earthquakes, and the like, is to go against what they themselves told us concerning their beliefs. If the truth need be known, even such calamities as enumerated above were often connected with the planetary deities, and they were so connected by the ancients themselves. Thus, to give but a few examples:\n\nAmong the Incas, Saturn was considered the god of famine. Almost throughout the entire world, Mars was considered the god of pestilence. Venus was associated with fear, darkness and death. The Babylonians, moreover, never discarded their belief that even earthquakes were actually caused by the planets.\n\nAdherents of the animistic theory, however, base their concepts of the origin of religion on the beliefs of present primitive peoples, rather than the civilized nations of the ancient world. But even there, their theory meets with various objections. Consider, for instance, the Efe pygmies of the Ituri forest whom we had occasion to mention in a previous chapter.\n\nThese pygmies do not cower in fear of thunder and lightning. Their lives are not ruled, or terrorized, by a squadron of jungle spirits that have to be appeased every time a calamity hits.",
