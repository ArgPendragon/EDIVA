He was given the title of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. Assuming the name of his god, he became popularly known as Emperor Elagabalus. When he moved from Emesa to Rome, he took the meteoritic “image” of his deity with him, which also became known as Elagabalus, and installed it in the temple of Kybele.",

            "content": "The Sumerian name for “iron” was an-bar, which means “fire from heaven.” The Hittites, who were among the first, if not the first, in the ancient world to use weapons made out of iron, called the metal ku-an, which also translates as “fire from heaven,” since, as they claimed, iron originated in the sky. The Assyrians also extracted iron from ore, but, to them, the metal was said to have been “fragments from heaven.” In Egypt, the name for “iron” was bia-en-pet or baat-en-pet, which translates as “metal of heaven”TM (although “thunderbolt of heaven” has also been suggested). In Egypt, the association of meteoric iron with the gods, and especially with the evil god Set, seems to have led to a taboo against the use of the metal.* A similar religious taboo is also known to have existed in ancient Israel. The Old Testament preaches against the use of iron tools in the construction of Yahweh’s altar.” The taboo against the use of iron was also observed in Greek and Roman cults.” A religious exception seems to have been allowed in Egyptian funerary rites. “Metal of heaven” was used in the manufacture of small symbolic instruments in connection with the rites of the dead, and such items were often interred with the deceased. These religious instruments are mentioned in the Egyptian prayers for the dead even though, because of the corrosive nature of iron, few of them have ever been retrieved.” Meteorites were also worshipped in Greece. Concerning this practice, Pausanias wrote: “Orchomenos has a sanctuary of Dionysos, but the most ancient one is consecrated to the Graces. They pay particular worship to rocks, saying they fell out of heaven...”” The Egyptian god Amon, who was, among other things, associated with meteorites, was a stone which fell from the sky.”",

            "content": "The Pallas Athena, known as the Palladium, in the citadel of Troy, on which the safety of the city was held to depend, was also said to have been a stone which fell to Earth.” So was the sacred stone at Delphi, said to belong to Kronos® who was Saturn. As G. A. Wainwright wrote in 1936: “Plenty of [other meteorites] could be mentioned as being kept in churches or temples, but let that of Casa Grande suffice. It was found in a room of an ancient Mexican temple carefully swathed in bandages.” Let not the reader delude himself into thinking that such beliefs and practices were merely the result of ancient and/or primitive naiveté. Modern-day Muslims might not care to admit it, but the most holy object in all of Islam, the Black Stone, which today is incorporated into the Ka’aba at Mecca, is also a meteorite. Here it is only fair to point out that Immanuel Velikovsky’s claim that the Black Stone was believed to have fallen from the planet Venus® cannot be substantiated. Even so, there seems to be no doubt that the Black Stone “had streaked out of the heavens one night in the forgotten past,” and that it is nothing but a meteorite.” There has been some speculation that this meteorite had originally been reddish in hue and that its present black color is simply due to the patina of ages.* To my knowledge, this has never been ascertained. In fact, there is reason to believe that the Stone’s blackness coincided with a special characteristic of mythic significance. That the Ka’aba was originally a shrine to the god and planet Saturn has now been documented.” Also, the myths and astronomical lore of various nations connect the color black with this very planet and its deity.© As Hildegard Lewy pointed out, “Saturn is frequently called the ‘black’ or ‘dark’ planet.” It is this particular Saturnian curiosity that points to the Black Stone’s selection as a Saturnian symbol. As Lewy wrote: “As this Black Stone was revered in a sanctuary dedicated to the cult of the ‘Black Planet’ Saturn, we comprehend that a black meteorite, or a black stone resembling a meteorite, was thought to be a piece of the ‘Black Planet,’ which means a part of the",

In this respect, the Mesoamericans were no different. They, too, were enticed with the observation of the Pleiades. Known to European observers as the Seven Sisters, this group of stars received considerable attention all over the world. As Anthony Aveni informs us: “The Sherente of Brazil still use the Pleiades today to mark the seasons. They say that the year commences in June when the Pleiades first appear as the sun leaves the constellation of Taurus... The Navajo dignify the Pleiades by associating them with their principal deity, Black God, creator of fire and light. In fact, a recognizable form of this group appears on the face of Black God. The Aztecs determined the occurrence of their most important feast day by the appearance of the Pleiades. According to Sahagiin, the ceremony of the Binding of the Years took place every fifty-two years and began when the Pleiades transited the zenith at midnight...”*",
