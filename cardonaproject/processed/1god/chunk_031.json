            "content": "The cave is used for a ceremony in honor of their Mayan ancestors, which includes the catching of mollies, a species of cave fish that feed on midges and midge larvae, which in turn feed on bacterial colonies that thrive on sulfur and excrete sulfuric acid. As Louise Hose, who has studied the ecosystem in this cave, reported:\n“There aren’t many places in the world where we can see complex ecosystems that are independent of sunlight. We see it at the mid-ocean ridges, and there are some hot springs. But this is an almost unique opportunity to study a complex ecosystem in a readily available site—where there’s no light coming in and yet we have a complex menagerie of organisms.”\nActuality, the propensity of varied organisms that live entombed within Earth’s caverns has been known and studied for far longer than Hose inadvertently intimates. Blind cave fish have been known since 1938; cave-dwelling salamanders since 1689. Not only do such creatures live in total darkness, light itself becomes a hazard—as proven by eyeless millipedes which curl up in frantic efforts to avoid artificially introduced beams of light. As Donald Jackson could already write in 1982:\n“Beneath the shroud of eternal darkness [that exists ‘deep within the underworld’], no green plants—the basis of the food chain for most creatures—can grow. The environment could hardly seem less hospitable to life. And yet, astonishingly, animals can thrive in the caverns of the earth. Unseen, unheard, they creep and crawl, slither and scuttle, swim and fly, endlessly questing for the means of survival. In their marvelous physical adaptations, in the senses they use to navigate the perpetual night of a rockbound realm, in their extraordinary behavior and reproductive patterns, they offer a microscopic study of evolution.”\nNone of these creatures of darkness are mammals, the class of animals to which man belongs. But consider the bat, many species of which spend their daylight hours hanging together upside down in the recesses of darkened caves. When they venture outside, it is at night—from total darkness to a lesser gloom. Their sonic ability allows them to navigate the caliginous corridors, often sinuous, as well as they do outside at night. Had they been blind, they would have been able to maneuver just as well. For all they require, the world outside could just as well be totally dark. They would survive.\nWithout relying on their sonic abilities, which they do possess, various mammals, as well as some birds, have adapted so well to thriving at night that we now class them as nocturnal animals.",

            "content": "Organic substances were either produced by ultraviolet radiation or by electrical discharges in the form of lightning from Earth’s primitive atmosphere.\nAs is well known, certain plants can grow in extreme environments, such as in the Arctic regions, while others have adapted themselves to grow only in the tropics. And yet, the chemistry of photosynthesis is identical in all these plants. What actually transpires is that photosynthesis proceeds at a rate that is directly proportional to the incident radiation in which the light energy is utilized with the greatest efficiency. Moreover, it has been calculated that only about one to three percent of the light falling on any plant is actually transformed into chemical energy. Most of the Sun’s radiation falling on a plant is lost through reflection and ineffective absorption by pigments other than chlorophyll (or, at least, other than those pigments in the chloroplasts).\nHow does all this affect our progressing theoretical construct?\nWell, for one thing, sunlight being starlight, photosynthesis would have been able to occur just as well under the light shed by the brown dwarf star that once was Saturn. Its dimmer light would have been compensated for by the plants’ ability to control absorption in proportion to the incident radiation falling upon them.\nEqually significant to our study is the fact that red light is the most important spectrum necessary for the growing of plants. Brown dwarf stars are known to radiate a propensity of red light. Thus, the spectrum of received light on Earth during the Saturnian period would have been much redder than at present and, therefore, more conducive to plant growth.\nThe brown dwarf star that was Saturn would have also radiated ultraviolet light. But then so does the Sun. Ultraviolet rays are normally considered relatively harmless and even beneficial. Long-term exposure to high concentrations of these rays can, however, also prove harmful. We have no way of knowing how highly concentrated the ultraviolet rays from Saturn would have been. Since, even at its best, the Saturnian sun was feebler than the Sun, it is quite possible that its ultraviolet radiation would also have been feebler. During the age of semi-darkness with which we are presently concerned, when Saturn had not yet flared up as a true sun, its entire radiation might have been feebler still. In the meantime, it has been found that mosses in the Antarctic region are able to produce certain compounds which act to protect them against excessive ultraviolet radiation. Who is to say that other plants might not have derived the same ability during the Saturnian era of semi-darkness had our brown dwarf primary radiated excessive ultraviolet rays?\nTHE REQUIRED TEMPERATURE\nLight and photosynthesis, however, are not the only requirements for the subsistence of plants and animals. Life also requires heat, at least warmth—or so we used to think. As it turns out, living organisms can, and do, manage to subsist in temperatures well below zero. In 1989, Michael Tennesen could report that:\n“In the 1960s the interior of Antarctica was declared a lifeless zone. But scientists have since discovered a rich array of organisms tucked away in isolated habitats. Robert Wharton, a biologist at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, has found life at the bottom of perpetually frozen lakes in an area of windswept, snowless valleys.”\nLake Hoare, situated in a mountainous region 800 miles from the South Pole, is covered by a 20-foot thick sheet of ice, the mean surface temperature of which reaches 4 below zero. And yet, colorful algae-like organisms manage to survive underneath the lake’s icy crust. As Wharton himself declared:\n“[These algae-like organisms are] a fairly advanced form of life. You’ve got a cell wall, and you’ve got DNA inside the cell that is able to reproduce and pass on information to its offspring. It’s not elephants, but it’s a big step in the evolution of biology.”\nOr, as Chris McKay succinctly phrased it, even in permanent subfreezing conditions, “life can persist much longer than we’d thought.”\nTrue, as Wharton admitted, these algae-like organisms are not elephants—and a far cry from land plants and animals, to say nothing about humans. But, as in the case of those creatures that are able to exist in total darkness, the above serves to illustrate that generalities can often be deceiving.\nAn adaptation to cold is not called for in the primeval Saturnian environment we are attempting to reconstruct. As we have already seen in Chapter 5, even at present, Saturn radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun. We saw there that, while Jupiter’s excessive heat is accepted as a residue from the planet’s formative period, most of Saturn’s had been relegated to kinetic energy released by the circulation of dissolved helium. But when Voyager 1 flew past Saturn in late 1980, it failed to uncover such evidence. As reported by Dennis Overbye:\n“Pioneer 11 had found that Saturn radiates almost three times as much energy as it receives from the sun. Some scientists had suggested that the helium might be settling deeper inside Saturn’s atmosphere than the hydrogen, releasing gravitational energy in the form of ‘helium rain.’ But this would leave Saturn’s outer layers relatively deficient in helium, and Voyager found that this was not the case.”",

Which brings me to ask: Has it ever occurred to anyone that the sun which bathed Earth with its radiance during its past geologic eras might not have been our present one?\n\nTHE PLASMASPHERE\n\nThe problem we now face is this: With Saturn stationed above Earth’s north celestial pole, and the Sun still somehow absent, how could the world have received uniform radiation? How could Earth’s southern hemisphere have been bathed in light and heat when it would have been entirely shielded from the north-radiating brown dwarf star that was Saturn?\n\nThese are questions that have intrigued various other researchers. Prime among them, back in 1980, was Roger Ashton. What he finally settled upon was a shell of gas and dust, or bubble, within the hollow of which the Saturn-Earth system would have abided. The interior surface of this shell, according to Ashton, would have reflected back Saturn’s radiation inward in all directions.\n\nA year later, Ashton was referring to this shell, or bubble, as a magnetosphere, the “distinctive layer” of which would have consisted “of a plasma opaque to visible light.” Being opaque, it would all the more have been able to reflect Saturn’s radiation inward in all directions.\n\nWhat Ashton did not know was that, for different reasons, Ralph Juergens had already proposed such a plasma sheath four years earlier. “Presumably,” Juergens had written, “both [Saturn and Earth] would be enveloped in a common magnetosphere which... would equate with a sheath between the solar-wind plasma and any material body, or closely coupled systems of bodies, at non-plasma potential.”",

            "content": "Thus, the “source of the heat bubbling up through Saturn’s clouds” remained “a mystery that Voyager could not solve.”\n\nMeanwhile, the atmospheric scientist James Lovelock has made a name for himself with his theory of Gaia in which Earth is treated as a living organism. While this work has nothing to say for or against this proposition, some of Lovelock’s insights are germane to our subject.\n“For example, [according to orthodoxy] we know that when the solar system was formed the sun was dim and that it has heated up ever since. Yet Earth wasn’t too cold for life in the beginning, and it isn’t too hot for life now.”\nWhile Lovelock gives his own reasons for this, the belief that the Sun was much weaker in Earth’s dim past has now gained acceptance. In analyzing the problems of climate thought to be inherent during the Archaean era—3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago—Gregory Jenkins speaks of an environment that “was very warm with a sun that is much cooler than today’s.”\nGeological evidence indicates that this trend continued into the early Precambrian period during which “Earth was much warmer...than it is today, despite a weaker sun.”\nBillions and millions of years are far removed from the Saturnian era with which we are concerned. The point I wish to stress, however, is that even as per orthodox belief, life on Earth does not seem to have required abundant heat from the Sun. We notice, for instance, that the reconstructions of primeval plants by paleobotanists, who are guided in their reconstructions by fossils found in coal and other deposits, end up showing some rather tall specimens exhibiting sparse crowns of foliage. Such a study, for instance, was recently conducted on specimens recovered from the coal seams of the American Midwest and Ohio Valley, which are believed to have been laid down by vast swamps which once stretched from Missouri to Pennsylvania. The lycopods, forty-five to ninety feet tall, that were reconstructed from these remains have all the appearance of trees which seem to be straining their trunks in order to reach a feeble light, just as some plants do when grown in a dimly-lit terrarium that is kept in a darkened room. Thus, for instance, when the succulent popularly known as hens-and-chickens, which usually grows relatively flat to the ground, is grown in such a terrarium, it tends to stretch tall and spindly with its fleshy leaves growing in an open and loose spiral until it either reaches the light or bends and breaks under its own weight.\nAs paleobotanists from the University of Illinois who studied the remains of lycopods ascertained: “Plant life was quite different then; most plants had no seeds, and flowers had not yet made their appearance.”\nTrue, these trees are supposed to have thrived one hundred million years before the present. (Photosynthesis manifested itself in blue-green algae at the end of the pre-Cambrian era some 200 million years ago—although this figure varies from one authority to another.)\nThe reconstruction of such trees, as also earlier and more primitive ones, together with vistas of the environmental terrain that sustained them, had been going on much earlier than the Illinois University experiment. Dated to the late Silurian and all through the Devonian periods (c. 325-280 million years ago), the first land-based plants all exhibited the same spindly character with sparse verdant crowns which, like the lycopod trees, give the impression that they all had to struggle for whatever available dim light there was to nourish them.
