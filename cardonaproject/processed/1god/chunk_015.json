            "content": "The deity identified as Ninurta is also known as Ningirsu. Like the former, the latter is portrayed as a luminary radiating a great light. This is recorded in Gudea's Cylinder B: \"Ningirsu...rose in overwhelming splendor. In the land it became day; the Eninnu, another epithet of the god, rivaled in brilliance the child of Enzu.\" Enzu, read as Zu-en, is more commonly known as Sin, while his \"child\" is Shamash, often referred to as Shamash mar Sin, meaning Shamash son of Sin. William Albright stated, \"Ningirsu is here the sun...who ascends each morning from the underworld.\" His understanding of this deity is further showcased when he claimed that \"Ningirsu, like Ninurta, seems to have been primarily a god of fertility with intimate solar associations.\" Albright recognized the solar associations of Ningirsu, but Jastrow’s earlier work demonstrated that Ningirsu was Saturn, not the Sun. This identification of Ningirsu with Ninurta is based on a series of deductions which not only confirm Ningirsu's ancient identity but also that of Ninurta. These deductions lead back to those omens which incorporate the formula \"when Shamash stands in the halo of Sin.\" The gloss explains that Shamash is recognized as the name for the planet Saturn (Lu-Bat Sag-US), and it clarifies that Ninib/Ninurta stands therein. This indicates, without reasonable doubt, that Ninib/Ninurta was the same as Lu-Bat Sag-US/Shamash/Saturn. Donald Mackenzie noted, \"The sun god was identical with Ninip and Nin-Girsu, resembling Babbar, the solar deity of Akkadian Sippar, whose Semitic name was Shamash.\" Furthermore, a slab relief of the god found in the temple of Ninurta in ancient Kalakh (or Kalhu), now known as Nimrud, depicts him wielding a scythe, a weapon favored by Kronos/Saturn. Jastrow admitted that Franz Kugler was correct in identifying \"the planet (Lu-Bat) whose name is Ninib [i.e., Ninurta]\" as Saturn. In a bilingual list of the planets housed in the British Museum, Ninurta is definitively listed as the name for the planet Saturn. It's essential to note that the term \"Lu-Bat\" can also refer to Mars and Mercury besides Saturn. A. F. O'D. Alexander misunderstood this usage when he posited that ambiguity arose from using Jubad (akin to Lu-Bat) sometimes for Saturn and other times for Mercury.",

The descriptive epithets added to \"Lu-Bat\" signify which of these three planets is meant: Lu-Bat Dir refers to Mars, Lu-Bat Gu-Ud to Mercury, and Lu-Bat Sag-US to Saturn. Meanwhile, an astrological text distinguishes Ningirsu as (An) Lu-Bat, which identifies the deity as a planet, though we are left to choose among Saturn, Mars, and Mercury. Nevertheless, Jastrow pointed out that listing Ningirsu as an alias of Ninurta clarifies which Lu-Bat is intended. If Ninurta was Lu-Bat Sag-US/Shamash/Saturn, then Ningirsu must share this identity.",

THE TRUE SUN Like that of other ancient nations, Hindu astronomy is inseparable from mythology. This particular mythology, however, continues to thrive as the basis of Hindu religion. Hence, it can be said that planetary worship is practiced among Hindus to this day—not only in an indirect way. One should recall the passage from the Linga Purana which admonishes that \"the worship of the planets should be pursued by good men.\" The reason for this admonition is to ward off evil during times of planetary harassment. Despite modern Hindus' limited awareness of these words, few practice planetary worship, which is beside the point. What matters is that the admonition forms part of one of the world's great religions.",

As earlier noted, another Sanskrit name for Saturn is Grahanayakah, meaning chief or leader of the planets, which is also a descriptor for the Sun. We have now reached a point where we face the risk of monotonous repetition. But it is essential to recognize that despite the recurring themes, the ancients provided significant insights into the cosmos. Ancient Egypt faces challenges, as they lacked formal astronomy until Ptolemaic times, preferring to regard celestial bodies as deities whose movements were too sacred for mundane numbers.",
