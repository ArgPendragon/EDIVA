Both orbit and magnetic field indeed change...1\nWe will not concern ourselves here with the change in Earth’s magnetic field, nor will we concern ourselves much with what led to this “discovery” beyond the shortest of synopses.\nWhat is at the bottom of it is the conclusion reached by the geologist Madeline Briskin in her investigation of seafloor core samples. Sediment has always been deemed a reliable indicator of past climatic conditions. What Briskin discovered through the age and molecular design of the ocean fossils embedded in the sediments she studied, led her to conclude that Earth’s climate follows a repetitive cycle of changes of approximately 413,000 years duration. This cycle, according to her, is brought about by Earth’s changing orbit as it moves closer to, then farther away from, the Sun. As far as the present work is concerned, no judgment will be passed on the possible validity or otherwise of this deduction. We merely note it as one indication of various theories from the establishment in which changes in Earth’s orbit are deduced from certain evidences and made to account for certain past situations.\nAre any of these scenarios any wilder than one which posits Earth to be an escaped satellite of Saturn? Ah yes—but the above events, whether they ever transpired or not, have all been dated to millions of years ago as opposed to the scenario being presented here which claims Earth to have still been a satellite of Saturn during the advent of man. This is an objection we will be running into time and again.\nIn 1986, Lynn Rose, who, with Raymond Vaughan, had been working on the Babylonian Ninsianna tablets, surprised Velikovsky’s followers by correcting their earlier conclusion, and that of Velikovsky himself, concerning the not-so-ancient orbit of the planet Venus. In 1950, Velikovsky had been of the opinion that the astronomical observations contained in these tablets—sometimes referred to as the Tablets of Ammizadugqa, sometimes simply as the Venus tablets—showed beyond a reasonable doubt that Venus had been moving on an entirely different orbit at the time the observations were conducted. Originally concurring with him, Rose and Vaughan eventually came to an entirely different conclusion.\n“Like many others, including Velikovsky, we at one time took it for granted that the Venus tablets would tell us about a radically different orbit of Venus...We have gradually come to realize, however, that at the time of the observations Venus might have been on or close to its present orbit...The strangeness of these eighth-century [B.C.] observations of Venus seems to be mainly due to their having been made from an Earth that was on a radically different orbit from the present orbit of Earth.”2\nIn 1993, Michael Reade came to similar conclusions, although the amount in Earth’s orbital expansion as given by him—from a posited 0.9904 AU to the present 1.000 AU—would not lend itself to being called radical, representing a mere 0.97% to 1% expansion.3",

            "content": "Once again, I shall not here comment on the validity, or otherwise, of these deductions. I merely mention them as the possible—even probable—fall-out of a set of Babylonian astronomical observations. On the other hand, I shall have more to say about this particular datum, but in a future work which will deal with the attainment of Earth’s present orbital path.\n\nTHE HABITABLE ZONE\n\nAn entirely different problem that our hypothesis raises concerns the distance of Earth from the Sun during the time it spent as a satellite of Saturn. It has, for instance, been pointed out that, were it not for the insulation provided by its atmosphere, Earth’s temperature would fall well below the freezing point of water, similar to that of the Moon. And that would be at Earth’s present distance from the Sun. What, then, would Earth’s temperature have been at Saturn’s present distance from the Sun—insulating atmosphere or not? This is most important because, needless to say, Earth’s temperature has a direct bearing on the sustenance of life. The existence of life on Earth, it has often been stated, is manifestly due to our planet’s distance from the Sun—it just happens to be positioned in the Sun’s habitable zone—which is the reason why it is the only planet in the Solar System capable of bearing life.\n\nEarth, it should be remembered, is at 1 AU from the Sun (approximately 93 million miles). Saturn is at 9.5 AU from the Sun (approximately 886.3 million miles). As a satellite of Saturn, would not Earth have been in the “freeze zone”? How, then, could it have sustained life, including that of man?\n\nWhat, exactly, is the extent of the Sun’s habitable zone? At one time the habitable zone was believed to stretch between 0.7 and 1.3 AU. In 1977, however, Michael Hart reduced this zone to the narrow range extending from 0.95 to 1.01 AU.4 This would still have meant that had Earth been 5% closer to the Sun, its oceans would evaporate; had it been only 1% further away, total glaciation would put an end to life. But then, in 1988, the scientists at NASA’s Ames centre found reason to increase the distance of the habitable zone by 50%.\n\nLife, however, requires more than the right amount of heat and sunlight. It also requires water, of which Earth has an abundance. But now here’s the rub. Long-range exploration of the planets has convinced astronomers that Venus and Mars also once possessed abundant water. In the case of Venus, its water is said to have evaporated into space because of its closer proximity to the Sun.5 This mechanism, however, does not work for Mars which is farther out from the Sun than is Earth. An entirely different process had therefore to be worked out for the red planet. As James Kasting wrote: “Mars is freeze-dried today, not because it is too far from the sun but because it is a small planet and therefore cooled off comparatively quickly.”6\n\nAll this has led to the belief that the habitable zone, which has now been revised to range “from just inside the orbit of Earth to beyond the orbit of Mars,” has “migrated slowly outward from its position when the planets first formed...about 4.6 billion years ago, because the sun has gradually brightened over time.” What this additionally entails is that in another billion years, as the Sun continues to brighten and becomes ever hotter, Earth’s orbit",

Maybe not, but, theoretically at least, could we not perhaps shift Saturn into the habitable zone? Actually, back in 1982, Ragnar Forshufvud theorized just that, moving a Saturn that had once been much larger to “much closer to the Sun”.7 But I only present this datum as an interesting exercise because, judging by what can be deduced from the mytho-historical record, the truth may have been exactly the opposite.\n\nBe that as it may, it is not really necessary to move a celestial body into the so-called habitable zone, or even closer to the Sun, in order to have it appropriately heated. Io, one of Jupiter’s satellites, is said to be heated through Jupiter’s tidal pull. Then why not Earth as a satellite of Saturn? And even then, do we really need Saturn’s tidal pull in order to heat Earth? Have we not already seen that Saturn radiates more heat than it actually receives from the Sun? Can not this excessive heat be seen as the residue from a time when Saturn was much hotter? Have we not, on the strength of the mytho-historical record, posited that Saturn had once been a miniature sun radiating its own heat and light? True enough, Saturn could never have been as hot as the Sun. The proximity of Earth to Saturn, however, would have more than compensated for this.",

Think about it: We have seen that Earth had been a satellite of what is now the planet Saturn, which planet was described as having been near enough to Earth to be remembered as a sphere, which sphere, in turn, was described as a sun that shone at night during a time when no other heavenly body could be seen.

David Talbott has long focused attention on this topic. As he had stated:\n“The Egyptians remembered the creator as the solitary Atum or Ra, whom we recognize as the planet Saturn. In the accounts of all periods, Ra is originally a solitary god. The ancient sun is he...who had no companions.”10\n“I am Atum, when I was alone in Nun,” the god is made to state.11 The deity is thus called “the God One,” the “Only God”—“except whom at the beginning none other existed.”12 Time and again, in Egyptian liturgies, we hear of Atum being made to state “when I was alone.”13 The god, “in his earliest remembered state,” as Talbott has noted, is inactive and motionless— “doing nothing, lacking activity or animation.”14\nIn an Egyptian Coffin Text, the god is made to claim: “[I was] he who had no companion when my name came into existence...I was the maker of myself” and “I came into being of myself.”15\nIn the Nesi-Khonsu Papyrus, we find the god described as “Lord of all the gods...the holy soul who came into being in the beginning...the first divine matter...the One One...except whom at the beginning none other existed.”16\nLikewise with Ra who, in the accounts of all periods, was remembered as having originally been a solitary god.
