And—in alphabetical order: Halton Arp, B.Sc., Ph.D., for his help concerning linear formations of bodies in space. Roger Ashton, for providing invaluable knowledge of Sanskrit. Ey Cochrane, for supplying material on the origin of Greek drama. Vine Deloria, Jr., for researching records pertaining to the distant sun amongst North and South American Indian sources. Lewis M. Greenberg, M.A., A.B.D., for encouragement throughout the years. David Griffard, Ph.D., who helped clarify aspects concerning the Saturnian age of darkness. Frederic B. Jueneman, for many discussions on the subject through the years, for lending his ear, and for spotting the odd cow flop. Ralph E. Juergens, B.S., for contributions regarding the electric properties of the Saturnian configuration. Birgit C. Liesching, for translations from German and French. David Lorton, Ph.D., for assistance with the Hebrew language. Ken Moss, for having acted as my sounding-board for the hypotheses presented herein, for supplying insights useful in this work, and for patiently proofreading the manuscript. Nancy Owen, B.S., M.Ed., for checking Mesoamerican material on calendars. Anthony L. Peratt, B.S.E.E., M.S.E.E., Ph.D., for teaching me much about plasma cosmology. Lynn E. Rose, B.A., M.A., for helpful suggestions in reviewing material on ancient astronomical knowledge. Donald E. Scott, B.S.E.E., M.S.E.E., Ph.D., for clarifying my understanding of how plasma and Birkeland currents work. Warner B. Sizemore, M.A., B.D., for providing access to rare ancient works on mythology and ancient religion. David N. Talbott, for sharing insights on ancient symbolism. Wallace Thornhill, for freely offering knowledge of plasma physics. I would also like to thank the British-based Society for Interdisciplinary Studies for allowing me to include most of my article, 'Planetary Identities: The Concept of Deity,' which first appeared in the Society's publication, Chronology & Catastrophism Workshop (1988). It appears here, with some changes, at the end of Chapter 8. Further gratitude goes to the publishers of the journals KRONOS and AEON for permission to use various excerpts from my own published works. Other than specified above and in the text itself, I bear no one with every facet of the theory presented in this work.",
