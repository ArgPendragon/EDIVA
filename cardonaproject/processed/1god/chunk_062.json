            "content": "The axial tilt debate then spilled into the early years of the twentieth century. Thus, in 1929, Harold Jeffreys could still ask: “Has the inclination of the earth’s axis to the plane of its orbit varied during its history?” As he himself confessed: “The answer to [this] question is a definite ‘Yes!’” By 1937, W. B. Wright continued to maintain that “the earth’s axis of rotation has not always had the same position” and that the “many changes of the position of the climatic zones on the surface of the earth” were “due to a displacement of the pole from its present position.” In 1950, Velikovsky himself provided an explanation for the tilting of Earth’s axis as having been due to close terrestrial interactions with the planets Venus and Mars, at different epochs during historical times. Forgetting that past giants of science had debated the possibility, his detractors, among them even some astronomers, maintained that terrestrial axial shifts had never been heard of and that the notion is not supported by scientific literature. Beyond stating my firm belief that the cosmic catastrophes described in Worlds in Collision were unfortunately displaced in time by Velikovsky, the present work has nothing to offer concerning the possibility of terrestrial axial shifts during historical times. My main interest, here, concerns the much earlier Tertiary period. In this respect, it is noteworthy to note that when, in the 1980s, remains of sub-tropical flora and fauna were discovered by Soviet scientists in Spitsbergen, the axial tilt hypothesis was revived and, as of this writing, continues to be the standing Russian (previously Soviet) understanding of what had to have transpired in ages past. “In the early 1980s, scientists proved the far North had once been a tropical paradise. The tilt of the earth shifted and so did the weather.” Most scientists on the American continent, however, were not convinced. As Johnson pointed out, Basinger, a Canadian, “would rather contemplate a plant/animal ecosystem that has no uniformitarian counterpart on today’s Earth.” But, as Johnson argued: How does one warm Earth’s polar regions in the Pliocene by 90° Fahrenheit without raising tropical temperatures to those of present equatorial areas, while frying the equatorial areas and drying them out? “[I]t is not reasonable to postulate a polar heat build-up that somehow misses the torrid zones of the Earth.”",

            "content": "“High-temperature environments in the Pliocene Antarctic and the Eocene High Arctic are geophysically unreasonable. To conform with thermodynamics, and an Earth tilted 23 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic [as at present], these environments had to be considerably closer to the equator. If they were closer to the equator, then either continental drift occurred both much more rapidly and mysteriously than the geological record indicates, or else the Earth has tilted or experienced crustal slippage in some fashion that allowed warming of these lands without disrupting the continuity of equatorial rainforests. Another mechanism has the Earth with little or no tilt to its axis of rotation, which removes seasonality and ensures light each day on each point of the globe, coupled with a dense canopy that allows much more even temperatures despite variation in latitude.” According to Bernard Delair, theoretically, Earth ought to rotate on a vertical axis “and may actually have done so in the geologically recent past.” And: “There ought to be no reason why any Earth-like planet undisturbed for untold ages should not have a vertically-positioned axis.” Unfortunately, there are various problems with the axial tilt hypothesis. To begin with, Delair’s declaration did not go unchallenged. As Michael Reade pointed out, “a spinning ball forced to traverse an elliptical orbit around a primary would adopt a tilted attitude.” As he, in turn, assured his readers, “it is never possible to get a free-spinning ball to spin with its axis either vertical or horizontal: the principal axis of the ball always settles to a well-defined and seemingly invariable angle of tilt.” This, as Reade pointed out, “has long been known to engineers: spinning bodies, such as turbines or speed governors, impose asymmetric stresses on their shaft bearings.” True, as Jane Francis noted, had Earth’s axis been perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, the Sun would have bathed the polar regions with twelve hours of light every day. At the poles, however, the Sun’s rays would have been weak and low-angled, similar to those experienced just before sunset. And this would have been insufficient for the growth of plants such as the remains of which have been discovered in polar regions. Why not then propose a model which would combine both theories? Would not a perpendicular Earth orbiting around the Sun with Saturn stationed at Earth’s north celestial sphere fill the bill? Not really because, for one thing, this would be contrary to what the mytho-historical record has to tell us. We have seen that, time and again, the record states that, during the age of semi-darkness, the Sun was not yet visible. And there is no point in appealing to the Pangea hypothesis to account for this invisibility. Had sunlight managed to filter at all through a heavier atmospheric envelope, as it must do on Venus, it would still have entailed a day-night succession which, as we have seen, is also disallowed by the record. And in order for the Sun to have been entirely shielded by an impenetrable terrestrial atmosphere, its substantiality would have had to have been denser than that of Venus. Venerean-like pressures at Earth’s surface, let alone an even greater burden, would not have allowed the survival of terrestrial mammals including the human race. At bottom lies this additional fact: While the axes of the Solar System planets point in different directions, those of Saturn and Earth come close to coinciding. Saturn is tilted at 26.7 degrees while Earth’s tilt is at 23.45 degrees. Both axes point to about the same spot in space. Saturn’s present north star is the same as Earth’s—Polaris. This is a situation that would be expected had Saturn and Earth once shared the same axis of rotation as our main thesis demands. What this seems to indicate is that, despite Delair’s assurance to the contrary, Earth’s present axial tilt is the most natural one for it to possess, and that it has not changed since at least the Tertiary period. What then of a perpendicular axis with an Earth in phase-lock outside the Solar System as posited by Ken Croswell for red dwarf planets? This, too, fails to fill the bill because, as we have already noted, while Croswell’s theoretical system would entail a world without variable seasons, it does not occasion one universal spring-like climate. True enough, the climate would not have been variable, but tropical and equatorial regions would still have been much warmer than the poles. The poles, in fact, would have been the recipients of low slanting rays and if such slanting rays from our own Sun would have been inadequate to allow the thriving of sub-tropical flora and fauna at the poles, neither would the slanting rays from a red or brown dwarf star. What if we were to adapt Croswell’s phase-locked system by having it encased within the totally warm plasma sheath we have already postulated for the proto-Saturnian system? Light and warmth would then have reached all latitudes in equal proportion without having to rely on an axial alignment, already posited as the most difficult mechanical configuration to maintain. In other words, why not adopt Wallace Thornhill’s scenario wherewith Earth was in just such a positional situation and that it only “broke” into polar alignment when it entered the Sun’s influence? This, then, would make the Saturnian system’s axial alignment a mere transitional event, which would be more amenable to celestial mechanics. As already claimed, the encasing of the proto-Saturnian system in a plasmasphere is our accepted tenet. In the end, however, it may even be found that both postulates—a denser atmospheric envelope and a plasma sheath—are quite compatible with each other since a denser terrestrial atmospheric envelope might have existed within the Saturnian plasma sheath. We would thus have a situation in which the light and heat from the proto-Saturnian sun would have been reflected back, or otherwise radiated outward and inward, from the plasma sheath and dissipated evenly through the greenhouse property of Earth’s denser atmosphere.",

What is not acceptable is that the axial alignment came into being upon the Saturnian system’s entry into our present Sun’s domain. CLUES FROM OTHER PLANETS Is evidence concerning any of the above at least available from other planets of the Solar system? Only to an extent because, after all, as far as the Solar System is concerned, the case for Saturn presented above is unique—which is not to say that similar systems might not yet be discovered out in space. Meanwhile, the extent to which other planets can provide some evidence, no matter how slim, is exemplified by Uranus. Lyle Broadfoot, for instance, was surprised to discover what he termed an electroglow bathing the sunlit side of Uranus. Its energy source still remains unknown. As we have posited for proto-Saturn, Philip Nicholson has also posited the one-time existence of a nebular cloud, or circumstellar disk, around Uranus. As we have already seen, very much like the Saturnian system we have been describing, the temperature of Uranus is globally uniform, even though, again like proto-Saturn, its north pole was found to be warmer than the rest of the planet. Of added interest here is that when Voyager 2 made this discovery, the north pole had been in darkness for forty years. As Thornhill indicated: “This offers a clue as to how the Earth might have had a uniform global climate during the Saturnian era...” Even more recently, it has been discovered that Jupiter’s satellite, Io, also has its poles as warm as its equator. “Aside from hot spots at volcanic sites, night temperatures on Io appear to be about the same near the equator as near the poles even though, as on Earth, the equator gets more direct sunshine to heat its surface.” True, Uranus and Io do not have a north polar sun to heat their northern regions, and I only include these data to show that such a state of affairs—global uniform temperature with a slightly warmer north pole—is not of itself a bizarre situation. That being the case, what need have we of an axial alignment between proto-Saturn and Earth? Why do we need to have the proto-Saturnian sun stationed in Earth’s north celestial pole to account for the single spring-like season in which Earth basked in past geologic eras.
