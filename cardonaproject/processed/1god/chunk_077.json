            "content": "\"The filaments look like textbook examples of electromagnetic vortices, consisting of an outer layer of spiraling helices surrounding an inner layer of nearly straight threads. What’s more, indirect measurements suggest that the strength of the magnetic field in the filaments is far greater than what most astrophysicists thought possible on such a scale — but just about what Peratt’s simulations predicted.\"[1]\nThis then raises the question as to where the original filaments that form galaxies come from. Arp talks of “newly created matter” as a matter of fact as so, also, do most astrophysicists. He, however, clarifies this by stating that “it would not strictly be new creation but merely materialization of mass-energy from a different, perhaps diffuse location.”[2]\n“Of course if the universe is operationally defined as everything that is detectable or potentially detectable there can be no such thing as ‘new’ matter. So when we speak of creation of matter we do not mean matter coming into our universe from somewhere else (there is nowhere else) or from nothing. We must mean the transformation of previously existing mass-energy. Probably this means materialization from a previously diffused state...”[3]\nGranted, Arp does not speak of plasma, but his “previously diffused state” can be understood as just that. In fact, if we are to believe Alfvén, plasma simply exists and, as we have seen, the entire Universe is actually composed of 99% of it. As Lerner paraphrased Alfvén’s argument:\n“In any plasma...tiny vortex filaments form spontaneously, and over time they grow larger and larger. Given enough time...there’s no reason why cosmic filaments couldn’t have grown to a length of billions of light-years. Gathering matter around them, the filaments could have organized the universe into a complex web of magnetic fields, electric currents, and plasma—a kind of cosmic power grid.”[4]\nOnce these filaments organize themselves into super-cluster complexes, they will have acquired so much mass that they will continue to be shaped by gravity as well as electric and magnetic fields. Gravity itself would break the filaments into “cluster-size clouds of plasma, like beads on a string.” Eventually, while being further compressed by new filaments, the plasma will again be broken up and, still according to Alfvén, would then form galaxies. More than that, the sequence would continue to be repeated in steps, down to stars, planets, and their satellites.[5] It is for this reason that plasma is now considered to be the Fundamental State of Matter. Or, as the renowned physicist David Bohm has been known to claim: “Plasmas are the origin of everything.”[6]\nThroughout the years, Arp has supplied a large body of observational evidence verifying the concept. Like some of the astral jets emanating from their centres, some galaxies also",

            "content": "Exhibit knots in their spiral arms.[1] Together with other evidence, this led Arp to believe that galaxies eject other, perhaps smaller, galaxies laterally along their plane of rotation.[2] Other evidence, however, indicated that galaxies can also be ejected from galaxies along their cosmic jets, that is along their axis of rotation, vertically from either pole.[3]\nStars, of course, are formed in galaxies. Arp believes that stars are also ejected from galaxies through their spiral arms. Actually, he believes the spiral arms themselves to be ejections which then become “the loci of new star formation.”[4] But then, in discussing poleward ejections, he stresses that: “The tyranny of the observations is to insist on opposite ejection of extragalactic material as a ubiquitous process that operates on all scales.”[5] If that is so, it would indicate that stars, too, could also be ejected poleward in opposite directions along galactic plasma jets. And, in fact, Arp gives “a vivid demonstration that the phenomenon of ejection of discretized bodies not only characterizes the birth of quasars and galaxies...it also extends down into the realm of young star formation.”[6] He does this by referring the reader to the photographs of HH 34, which we have already encountered in a previous chapter as a Herbig-Haro object displaying distinct knots in its jet. He then goes on to say that “there is an uncanny resemblance between the formation of young galaxies and the formation of young stars.”[7] And, to be sure, the belief that Herbig-Haro objects actually give birth to stars is now being preached as a matter of fact.[8]\nIf galaxies eject galaxies, and galaxies eject stars, all along their plasma jets in opposite directions in direct line with their axis of rotation, can stars eject dwarf stars through the same process? As we have seen, mainstream astrophysicists are now convinced that brown dwarfs can be ejected from star forming regions if not from stars themselves. As Reipurth phrased it, “the smallest [stellar] embryos will often be completely ejected from the star-forming region, destined to spend eternity alone as brown dwarfs.” But also “some brown dwarfs may be kicked out of the star-forming cores.”[9]\nSpeaking of the “knots” seen in the jet emitted by HH 34, Thornhill offered the following:\n“In my humble opinion, HH 34 is spitting out objects which might become individual brown dwarfs...”[10]\nBut if Arp is correct in that the ejection of cosmic bodies takes place at all scales, why should the next step down not be the ejection of planets from brown dwarfs?\nThornhill, however, included gas giant planets with these brown dwarfs—and more. As he explained, “brown dwarfs in the plasma environment of a brighter star become gas giants, spitting out rocky planets and moons from their interiors in an attempt to alleviate electrical stresses.” When it comes to the direction in which these bodies are ejected, Thornhill then offered the following: “Whether the spitting occurs in the polar or equatorial direction depends on which is the stronger, the polar or the toroidal magnetic field of the spitter.”",

            "content": "Depends on which is the stronger, the polar or the toroidal magnetic field of the spitter.”[1] As he had previously expounded:\n“The Hubble Space Telescope has shown that in regions of star formation large bodies are being shot out as if from a gun...Once again plasma discharges provide a mechanism which can simply explain this...Beyond a certain size proto-stars become electrically unstable and ‘fission,’ spitting out some of the core and giving rise to one or more companions...Not all of the matter ejected from the core of a proto-star may coalesce into a companion star. It may be in the form of one or a number of gas giants...A gas giant, in turn, due to either internal or external electrical disturbances may fission, spitting out its core, to give rise to the highly condensed planets, moons, asteroids, comets, etc.”[2]\nI shall not burden the reader with the detailed electro-mechanics behind this new ejection theory, which involves plasma pinch effects, electrical charge separation, Peratt instabilities, and the probable electrical nature of gravity itself, since these are best understood by experts in plasma physics.\nOBJECTIVE EARTH\nThat brown dwarfs can “spawn their own planetary systems” is now being considered by mainstream astronomers.[3] Thornhill, too, feels “confident that brown dwarfs ‘give birth’ to fully formed planets (and maybe expulsion disks).”[4] The question concerns the manner in which such planets are expelled. In discussing poleward eviction, Arp is also of the opinion that “the phenomenon of ejection of discretized bodies not only characterizes the birth of quasars and galaxies,” but that “it also extends down into the realm of young star formation.”[5] He then asks: “Does the same mechanism evident in the formation of these young stars extend to the formation of planets?”[6] That question he answered in a private communiqué he wrote to this author:\n“The HH objects indeed show luminous knots obviously ejected in a line from a central source. I included a picture of HH 34 in Plates 8-19 and 8-20 in my book ‘Seeing Red.’ The purpose of that inclusion is to demonstrate that such ejections happen on both galactic and stellar scales in the universe. I personally consider the outrageous possibility that planets could originate in such fashion also.”[7]\nBut from brown dwarf stars? Do brown dwarfs emit jets? Thornhill, for one, finds brown dwarfs too electrically low-stressed to eject plasma jets. As he outlined the problem:\n“We have no evidence that brown dwarf stars are active enough to produce polar jets. The examples we have of polar jets, from AGNs to HH objects, suggests unusual electrical activity. In the case of HH objects, they are generally more active than our Sun, that is, more electrically stressed.”[8]\nArp himself does not treat dwarf stars, brown or red. As we have seen, however, observations have led him to believe that poleward ejection is a process that operates on all scales. So why not brown dwarf stars?\nTrue, no jets from brown dwarfs have so far been detected. Because of their low mass and feeble optical radiation, however, brown dwarf stars themselves are very difficult objects to detect. The detection of any existing jets emanating from them would be all that more difficult. Even so, there are other emissions from brown dwarfs to be considered. Thus, even as the writing of this book is nearing the end, astronomical discoveries continue to accumulate in favor of its thesis. To begin with, on December 15, 1999, Bob Rutledge and his colleagues noted an X-ray flare emanating from the brown dwarf star designated LP 944-20, located in the constellation Fornax, estimated at 16 light-years from Earth. “It seemed fantastically bright and hard to believe,” said Gibor Basri who then hailed from the University of California at Berkeley. The flare appeared “briefly as an intense flash before fading out over the following two hours.”[9]\nLess than a year later, a group of graduate students on a National Science Foundation summer program, working at the Very Large Array near Socorro, New Mexico, detected strong radio waves emanating from the same brown dwarf star. These emissions “spiked up to 10,000 times stronger than what astronomers thought possible, indicating an intense flare of energy that may be similar to flares on the Sun,” researchers said. The dwarf was found to emit these radio waves constantly “with intermittent flares that last for hours.” As Shri Kulkarni stated: “Many astronomers are surprised at this discovery, because they didn’t expect such strong radio emissions from this object.”[10] Or, as Eduardo Martin, from the University of Hawaii, phrased it:\n“It is not surprising that LP 944-20 has flares, but it is surprising that they are so bright in the radio [wavelengths]. The result is significant in telling us that brown dwarfs break the rules of stellar astronomy.”[11]\nCall me naive when it comes to plasma physics, but do not these two items tend to throw a certain amount of doubt regarding Thornhill’s claim that brown dwarf stars are too electrically low-stressed to enable them to emit jets. Besides, as Arp discovered in a certain galaxy that he has studied, the radio jet, the X-ray jet, and the optical jet “are all coincident and define a precise ejection axis.”[12] Radio and X-ray emissions thus seem to go hand in hand with optical jets. So if brown dwarfs emit both radio and X-ray emissions, the likelihood of their emitting optical jets does not seem that far-fetched.\nAdditionally, and more importantly, there are the so-called accretion, or circumstellar, disks to consider. As we have seen, the birthplace of planets these disks could not be. Most, if not all, of the stars emanating plasma jets, however, are also encircled by these disks. Do brown dwarfs exhibit such disks?",
