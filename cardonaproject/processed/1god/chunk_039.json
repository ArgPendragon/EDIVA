            "content": "In the nineteenth century, E. H. Shackleton discovered seven seams of coal at about latitude 85°, each of which was between three and seven feet thick, testimonials to ancient forests which once grew where now not a single tree, not even a blade of grass, can grow. The coal seams that run through the Transantarctic Mountains are some of the most extensive on Earth. Sandstone, associated with this coal, was found to contain petrified coniferous wood. Fossils from the Pliocene include well-preserved wood in the form of tree stems as well as roots together with the remains of marine life. (And this is to say nothing about fossil forests from even earlier eras found near the South Pole, when the climate believed to have prevailed at the time should not have allowed such growth.) In 1935, Admiral Byrd could write that: “Here at the southernmost known mountain in the world, scarcely two hundred miles from the South Pole, was found conclusive evidence that the climate of Antarctica was once temperate or even sub-tropical.” The Eocene evidence of vast forests in the Antarctic has been attributed to a paleolatitude which was close to that of present Madagascar, while Antarctica is supposed to have still been drifting toward the pole. Continental drift can therefore be used to solve the mystery by those who adhere to this belief. Melvin Cook, however, is of a different opinion. According to his findings, Antarctica “appears not to have moved appreciably in continental shift” since the continents which were once in contact with it “left Antarctica in radial directions,” thus leaving it more or less in the same locality. Besides, as we have seen, the problem also involves the Arctic regions where, even according to orthodoxy, continental drift cannot save the day. But the enigma entails more than just Earth’s polar regions; it also embraces the latitudes in between. Thus, from early in the twentieth century, many paleobotanists were convinced that “during by far the greater portion of time since the Azoic era, mild, benign climatic conditions have existed.” According to Dolph Hooker: “It is also the consensus that, astonishingly and inexplicably, such conditions were comparatively uniform over most of Earth’s surface; that temperate climate extended both north and south to within the polar circles. It is also believed that, amazingly, seasonal effects during most of geological time have been much less pronounced than they are now.” Writing in 1912, F. H. Knowlton stated that:",

Far north as the Arctic Circle. According to Colbert, “the definitely zoned climatic belts, so familiar to us at the present time, apparently did not exist.” Moreover, this situation prevailed from long before the Tertiary period as Elso Barghoorn indicated: “From the paleontological evidence available, it would appear that there was very slight climatic zonation between high and low latitudes during the major part of the Carboniferous.” There was thus an added problem that confronted paleobotanists. How could Earth’s polar regions been blessed with a sub-tropical climate while the rest of the world remained little, if at all, warmer than it is at present? As Barbara Bell admitted: “It is by no means clear that solar radiation sufficiently intense to keep the poles as warm as they appear to have been at times would not heat the tropics more than observations indicate.” THE CRETACEOUS CLIMATE Continental drift, through sea-floor spreading, is an ongoing process. Christopher Scotese, a geologist, now predicts that, in another 250 million years, Great Britain will have been pushed to a near-Arctic locale, with the Atlantic Ocean having become nothing but a distant memory. Just as all land masses are believed to have been joined together, 250 million years ago, in a super-continent which geologists have named Pangaea, a new mega-continent, already dubbed Pangaea Ultima, will by then have formed. Africa would have rammed Europe, uplifting the colliding edges in a Himalaya-like mountain range while eroding the Mediterranean in the process. The Atlantic Ocean would first widen, then reverse its course and finally close up completely. It is not, therefore, surprising that geologists and paleoclimatologists have tended to rely on this process to account for the moving of once-tropical areas into what are now the Arctic and Antarctic regions. As noted in the above report, Great Britain seems destined to do exactly that. As we have seen, however, continental drift cannot be made to account for the sub-tropical fauna and flora of the Tertiary period, the remains of which are now found within the Arctic Circle, for the simple reason that the Arctic regions were already close to their present location at the time. But what of earlier eras?",

            "content": "While the flora and fauna of the Cretaceous period, calculated to have prevailed 140 to 100 million years ago, was not exactly the same as that of the following Tertiary period, the climate does not seem to have been that much different. As Richard Kerr noted: “The earth of the Cretaceous Period 100 million years ago was unaccountably warm, as it generally had been since the end of the last great ice age 140 million years earlier...” “Explaining Cretaceous climate has been difficult because it differed so from today’s. Coral reefs for which warm water is essential ranged as much as 1500 kilometers closer to the poles than they do today, as did nonseasonal land plants. Deep ocean water that now hovers near freezing was 15° (Celsius) warmer...Alligators and crocodiles seem to have thrived at latitudes as far north as that of present-day Labrador. And there is no evidence of any permanent ice like that which today deeply buries Antarctica and Greenland.” “Not only was it generally warmer during the Cretaceous, but it was particularly warmer in the polar regions.” Because the position of the continents during the Cretaceous would have been different from the locales they would have occupied later during the Tertiary, scientists continued to seek an answer to the riddle of the earlier climate via continental drift. This was not only because the lands within the present Arctic Circle would have been farther removed from polar regions than they would have been during the following Tertiary, but also because the different continental configuration would have led to the development of an entirely different climatic regime. It was thus reasoned that: “Continents bunched in low latitudes near the equator, as Cretaceous continents tended to be, would allow warm ocean currents to carry heat poleward. High-latitude polar oceans, being less reflective than land, would also absorb more heat and further moderate climate.” Eric Barron and Warren Washington therefore decided to test this hypothesis by recreating the Cretaceous climate through the use of a computer model. Others followed suit. There is no point in tracing the ups and downs of these various attempts and the disagreements between them. Suffice it to say that, in 1984, Kerr could safely state that",

            "content": "“There must be more to the long slide from the balmy Cretaceous period into the ice ages than the drifting of continents.” Turning to the contradictory results of these studies, he came to the conclusion that, so far, “computer models have failed to warm Earth as much as it was warmed in the Cretaceous, suggesting that a single geographic factor or perhaps even a combination of them cannot totally explain long-term climate change.” TREE RINGS One of the main reasons why paleoclimatologists have been reluctant to accept a former universal spring-like environment to account for the previous existence of Arctic and Antarctic sub-tropical flora and fauna is that evidence exists which does seem to point to past seasonal stability. This evidence comes from tree rings. As every Boy Scout knows, tree trunks are marked out in transverse section into concentric rings, one ring for each “season” of growth. In order to tell the age of a felled tree, Boy Scouts are taught to count the number of rings laid out in its trunk. Known as annular rings, these growth marks owe their emergence to differences in the elements at the beginning and end of each growing period. Fossilized trees from various past ages show distinct annular rings. Others do not. Wood retrieved from late Paleozoic deposits in the southern hemisphere has been said to show pronounced ring growths. So, also, fossils of deciduous trees from the Cretaceous. In fact, fossilized wood samples ranging all the way from the Devonian to the Eocene have been claimed to show well-marked annular rings. The scientific literature on this subject, however, is very ambiguous. More recent work has tended to show that rings are either lacking or very weak in all known specimens from the Devonian period which seems to indicate a non-seasonal environment. Most fossil trees from the Carboniferous period, which followed the Devonian, also lack rings. As Elso Barghoorn noted: “One impressive indicator of uniform climate over great areas of the Carboniferous continents is the great absence of annual growth rings in coal-swamp trees. The entire question of ring development in woody plants is one fraught with botanical variables as well as climatic variables. However, the consistent absence of any index of seasonal growth seems difficult to explain except on the assumption that winter cold and seasonality of rainfall were absent or at a minimum.” By the time we come to the late Permian period, still within the Paleozoic era, we end up with a mixed bag. Fossil woods from Canada, Europe, and Asia have weak or non-existent rings, while those from South America, Africa, and Antarctica show prominent and wide growth rings. A mixed bag from trees growing in different areas may be expected. But what about a similar mixed bag from trees known to have grown in the same locality? Thus, moving slightly closer to our time, we come to the Triassic period of the Mesozoic era. Few fossil trees are known from this period and, up till now, all of them come from Arizona’s petrified forest. One specimen from this collection lacks annular markings, but others display very wide prominent rings. In samples from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods of the same Mesozoic era, as well as from the Early Tertiary period, tree rings range from prominent to non-existent, depending on the paleolatitude in which they are claimed to have thrived. When it comes to polar fossil plants, as Edward Berry noted: “Detailed comparisons of these Arctic floras with contemporary floras from lower latitudes...show unmistakable evidence for the existence of climatic zones...” C. P. Brooks reached the same opinion, claiming that climatic zones existed in the Eocene,” as so did Ralph Chaney, who pushed the margin up to the Pliocene.” As Jane Francis noted, samples of wood collected by her on Axel Heiberg Island showed clear annular rings over a quarter of an inch wide. And, because the darker latewood added at the end of the growing season featured very narrow bands, the conclusion has been drawn that the trees grew rapidly during the twenty-four hour sunshine period of the Arctic summer and then closed up shop during the winter hours of darkness.” The problem with this, however, is that trees would not have survived such prolonged periods of darkness. And then there is the fauna to consider. What—did tapirs and crocodiles sleep through these darkened months? Could land tortoises have migrated to warmer climes? Besides, where did the warmth that would have been needed to thaw the Arctic ice cap come from? The present Sun is not capable of accomplishing that feat. And if the Sun, as accepted by orthodoxy, had been dimmer in those eras, it would have been able to accomplish it even less. Or are we to believe that sub-tropical flora and fauna existed in an ice-bound region, and for millions of years at that? But how, then, do we get out of this dilemma? Johnson, who grappled with this problem until the time of his untimely death in 1995, noted that “[I]t is not clear that the tree rings point to a polar seasonality as opposed to an ordinary seasonal growth cycle,” but did not clarify what he meant by “ordinary seasonal growth cycle.” Needless to say, the evidence of the tree rings poses just as much of a problem to the Saturnian scenario we have been considering. All of which forces us to ask yet another question: Are annular rings really indicative of seasonality? Actually, annular rings are only formed in those plants whose growth is interrupted by a regular winter or dry “season.” The increment of new wood formed in these trees is marked by a distinct line which is produced by the contrast between the late summer of one year and the spring of the next. The lines of separation between successive rings mark the limit of a microscopically thin layer of cells, known as the cambium, which lies between the wood and the bark, at the end of each successive growth period. The bark then cracks and/or expands to allow for the new growth of wood, and the tree trunk is thus thickened. It should be noted, however, that the cambium responds mainly to conditions of temperature and rainfall rather than the incidence of light. In temperate climates, the cambium produces new wood only during spring and early summer. It becomes inactive during autumn and winter. But what about trees growing in tropical and equatorial regions where seasonal differences disappear? Do they still grow rings? As it happens, many kinds of evergreen tropical trees do not grow rings. But others do. As Barghoorn reported: “In existing woody plants, annual ring development may occur under nearly uniform climatic conditions, as in equatorial rainforests.” What, then, is it in this seasonless environment that tells these trees that a year has passed and that it is time to grow more wood and thus form a new ring? That the growth of annular rings is not tied to seasonal change is evidenced by the fact that some trees have been known to grow as much as three or four rings in one year. Nor is this an uncommon situation, as Nelson Glueck noted, especially in trees which grow on sloping ground that turns wet and dry several times in one year because of rapid outflow of water. According to an item in Nature magazine, multiple rings in larch trees were normal in 1919; in fact, larches seem to be prone to multiple ring growth. Meanwhile, trees which miss growing a ring in certain years have also been known.” As Herbert Sorensen pointed out: “In dry and climatically harsh years, no detectable growth may occur. In this case no ring is formed and the ring is missing for that season of the year.” In some cases, as much as five percent of the rings may be missing. In fact, growth rings are lacking in a majority of trees which thrive in subtropical and tropical climates while others fail to grow rings regardless of climate.",

That being the case, the lower incidence of light from the Saturnian sun, as compared to the higher incidence from our present Sun, would have posed no obstacle to the growth of trees. Temperature would also have posed no problem because, while the Saturnian sun would not have been as hot as our present Sun, its proximity to Earth would have compensated for its lower caloric output. As we have seen, it is quite apparent that trees grow rings, or fail to grow rings, regardless of seasonal change or stability. More importantly, if trees can, as they do, grow rings in tropical and equatorial regions in which there is no appreciable seasonal change, what is so problematic with having trees growing rings in a sub-tropical Arctic which enjoyed but one spring-like season? Paleobotanists remain hard-pressed to account for the growth of sub-tropical forests and the existence of sub-tropical animals within the Arctic Circle. Uniform heat and light, to say nothing of the absence of an ice cover, would have been required for the flourishing of such forests and the thriving of such animals.",
