Greenberg, M.A., A.B.D., for his encouragement through the years.\n\nDavid Griffard, Ph.D., who was instrumental in clarifying certain aspects concerning the Saturnian age of darkness,\n\nFrederic B. Jueneman, for our many discussions on the subject through the years, for lending his ear, and for spotting the odd cow flop.\n\nRalph E. Juergens, B.S., for his helpful contributions regarding the electric properties of the Saturnian configuration.\nBirgit C. Liesching, for translating works from German and French.\nDavid Lorton, Ph.D., for his help with the Hebrew language.\n\nKen Moss, for having acted as my sounding board regarding the hypotheses presented herein, for supplying the odd insight made use of in this work, and for patiently proofreading the manuscript.\n\nNancy Owen, B.S., M.Ed., for checking the Mesoamerican material on calendars.\nAnthony L. Peratt, B.S.E.E., M.S.E.E., Ph.D., for teaching me much about plasma cosmology.\n\nLynn E. Rose, B.A., M.A., for his helpful suggestions in reviewing the material on ancient astronomical knowledge.\n\nDonald E. Scott, B.S.E.E., M.S.E.E., Ph.D., for clarifying my understanding of how plasma and Birkeland currents work.\n\nWarner B. Sizemore, M.A., B.D., for furnishing me with various rare ancient works on mythology and ancient religion.\nDavid N. Talbott, for sharing his insights on ancient symbolism.\nWallace Thornhill, for giving freely of his knowledge of plasma physics.\n\nI would also like to thank the British-based Society for Interdisciplinary Studies for allowing me to include most of my article, “Planetary Identities: I—The Concept of Deity,” which first appeared in the Society’s organ, Chronology &2. It appears here, with some changes, toward the end of Chapter 8. Further gratitude must also go to the publishers of the journals KRONOS and AEON for permission to use various excerpts from my own published works.\n\nOther than as specified above and in the text itself, I burden no one with each and every single facet of the theory presented in this work.\n\niv",
