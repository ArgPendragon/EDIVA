It was no different among the Sioux who, as recently as 1981, were still preaching that the four seasons had not pre-existed but were bestowed as a boon at a later time. What is also instructive is that man continued to hold the north responsible for the eventual arrival of the seasons. The sun of Creation, so claim the Sioux, appointed the north to be the caretaker of this earth. More than that, at a time when the sun did not move yet, did not rise and did not go down, when it just stood in one place, the Creator made the four seasons for the north to take care of.",

                    "content": "This chapter is included in order to forestall the objections that might be raised by those who see polar wandering through the wholesale shifting of Earth’s crust as a possible mechanism by which non-polar latitudes could have been driven into the Arctic regions. From the 1940s to the mid-1950s, for instance, Ting Ying Ma was involved in the study of corals which led him to declare that the position of the equator (and, therefore, also of the poles) had shifted from one geologic age to another. What did these studies involve? Very much like trees, corals grow rings which are believed to indicate a cycle of seasonal growth; in winter, coral cells grow small and dense, whereas in summer they grow larger and more porous. Ma noticed that the rates of total annual growth in corals in identical, or similar, species increased with proximity to the equator, while seasonal variation in growth rates increased with distances from the equator. This enabled him to correlate coral growth with latitude, which furnished him with a technique for investigating Earth’s ancient climates. It also led Ma to two related conclusions: (1) That seasonal change was clearly indicated in the oldest geologic periods, and (2) that the latitudinal temperatures of the past had been about the same as at present. If this is correct, a world without seasons, as proffered in the preceding chapter, could not have existed. What all of this conveyed to Ma was that, in the past, the position of the equator had changed from one geologic period to another and that none of these coincided with the present equatorial position of land. One of these earlier equators was even found to have bisected the Arctic Ocean. The mechanism for this displacement was then attributed to a sliding of the lithospheric shell over Earth’s liquid core, like the loose skin of an orange sliding around its fruit. Ma, however, could not match earlier equators in one hemisphere with corresponding ones for the same period on the opposite hemisphere in order to derive a complete circle. He therefore had to assume that continental drift was also involved and that it was this independent shifting of the continents which had thrown the ancient equators out of line. These combined displacements, of which Ma could deduce four separate events, were, according to him, sudden in execution and all in the same direction. He calculated them to have taken place during the last million years with the last readjustment having been completed 65,000 to 2,800 years ago. Most of Ting Ying Ma’s works were published by him in Fukien, China, and are very difficult to obtain; although they are available from the Schermerhorn Library at Columbia University. The information concerning Ma’s work in the present chapter has been gleaned from C. H. Hapgood, The Path of the Pole (N.Y., 1970), pp. 26, 79-87, 161, as also from Ma’s paper “Alteration of Sedimentary Facies on the Ocean Bottom and Shortness of the Period of Diastrophism After a Sudden Total Displacement of the Solid Earth Shell,” Oceanographica Sinica II:1 (September 1955).",

The theory was, however, disqualified in August of 1950 by the British Association for the Advancement of Science for the simple reason that no mechanism could be found to account for the movements of the continents. It was then revived, thanks primarily to S. W. Carey, in March of 1958, at a symposium on the subject that was held at the University of Tasmania. In the early 1960s, a cause was eventually tendered by Harry Hess, who submitted that the upwelling of magma through immense rifts, or faults, in ocean bottoms was capable of carrying the floating continental plates with them as the magma spread to both sides of the rifts. The actual mechanism was to be found in the convection currents.",

Where the spreading ocean bottom meets the edge of another continental plate, it is subducted back into the interior, wrinkling the continental edge and uplifting it into mountain ranges in the process. The theory has now become dogma, proving sound Ma’s utilization of it at a time when it was still anathema to do so. On the other hand, the second half of Ma’s theory, concerning the wholesale shifting of Earth’s lithosphere, which, in any case, was the brainchild of Hugh Auchincloss Brown, remained in dispute. Ma’s theory is thus left reliant on his coral evidence. How valid is this? First of all, as Thomas Stephenson warned in 1959, long after Ma had conducted his studies of corals, older accounts concerning the process of coral formation should be read with reserve, since the ideas in vogue on this subject have until recently been largely speculative and too much based on the study of the skeleton. It is obvious that the skeleton is merely an imperfect if permanent record of the activities of the polyps, and study of the latter reveals the fact that in some cases at least, conclusions as to the manner of growth drawn from the skeleton may be entirely erroneous. Granted that Stephenson was mainly concerned with the growth of coral reefs, the same can be said of older accounts pertaining to the growth of the polyps themselves, as indeed Stephenson makes clear when he refers to more recent studies by Matthai in relation to the formation of coral polyps.",

                    "content": "Now it has long been known that corals are restricted to tropical and sub-tropical zones despite the fact that, in certain past epochs, coral reefs had a far wider distribution than is now the case, their remains being plentiful in latitudes at which they cannot now maintain themselves. Thus, while Ma’s shifting latitudes could explain coral remains out of present tropical and sub-tropical climes, it has nothing to offer regarding their overall much wider distribution. The growth of corals requires an average annual water temperature of no less than 70° F. The polyps themselves, however, are insensitive to light. But their endodermal tissues contain myriads of microscopic one-celled algae which thrive only in the presence of strong light. This makes for a highly successful symbiotic relationship since the corals rely on the algae to absorb their waste products. Thus, both warmth and strong light are necessary for the successful growth of corals and coral reefs. The biggest problem with Ma’s evidence, however, concerns the period of time represented by a single coral reef which, at most, can be said to bridge a few thousand years, hardly enough to embrace a single geological period. Thus, for instance, as reported by Charles Hapgood: \"At Pago Pago harbor, borings were made down to the basalt underlying the reef, and after estimates of the growth rate were arrived at, the age of the reef (Utelei) was estimated at 5,000 years. When these spans are compared with those of entire geological periods of the order of 20,000,000 or 30,000,000 years, it is clear how fragile must be any conclusions based on the assumption that a given coral reef in Europe was contemporary with another one in North America.",

In the late 1950s, Hapgood picked up the topic of polar wandering due to Earth’s sliding crust and made a reputation for himself as the theory’s foremost advocate. Hapgood was able to trace the pole’s shift from the Yukon to the Greenland Sea around 80,000-75,000 BP; from the Greenland Sea to Hudson Bay around 55,000-50,000 BP; and from Hudson Bay to its present location around 17,000-12,000 BP.

Besides, the shifts proposed above would not have brought sub-tropical regions into the Arctic Circle; they would merely have shifted latitudes by about 30° which, today, would be like moving Winnipeg and Vancouver to the latitude of Ellesmere Island. Hapgood was of course aware of this but, as he had to admit, it would be futile to try to determine the location of the poles in the more remote cases since with every step backward in time the evidence naturally becomes thinner. Even so, despite the scarcity of evidence, what the totality of Hapgood’s theory proposed is that the region which is now within the Arctic Circle would have earlier been closer to the equator, which would account for its sub-tropical flora and fauna, before it shifted to its present location.",

This maladjusted dispersion was thus believed capable of producing a centrifugal momentum which was then transmitted to the rigid crust. As this centrifugal force increased, Earth’s crust tended to slide over the viscous layers underneath. But, although Einstein himself was at first receptive to this idea, he later expressed strong doubts about it, as did Kirtley Mather. The biggest problem here is that masses situated at, or very close to, the poles produce minimal centrifugal effect. As Hapgood himself was eventually bound to conclude: \"Advancing knowledge of conditions of the earth’s crust now suggests that the forces responsible for shifts of the crust lie at some depth within the earth rather than on its surface.” Even so, like Ma before him, and despite the set of requirements which he proposed, Hapgood was eventually forced to admit that the cause behind the shifting crust remains bereft of a satisfactory explanation.",

Within the past 80,000 years, Hapgood believes that the location of the north pole has changed three times in shifts lasting 5,000 years, as compared to Ma’s four displacements in the last million years. The north pole, according to Hapgood, has been in its present location for 12,000 years as compared to Ma’s 65,000 to 2,600 years ago. (Compare these figures to those deduced by Auchincloss Brown: 41,800 years ago; 18,400 years ago; 11,400 years ago; with the last shift occurring 7,000 years ago). Nor, incidentally, do Hapgood’s shifts all occur in the same direction as Ma’s. Thus, as Ellenberger had to conclude, Earth’s shifting crust, if such it is, appears to leave contradictory clues.",

But can poles really shift? Thomas Gold certainly thought so. He was not, however, concerned with the wholesale shifting of Earth’s crust as much as he was by the actual toppling of the globe. Writing in 1958, Gold stressed the fact that there is no general physical law that prevents a body from turning over with the aid of internal forces only. The general law of the conservation of angular momentum merely prohibits a change of the value and direction in space of the body’s angular momentum unless acted upon by an external force; but it has nothing to say about the orientation of the body relative to that direction. Earth’s stability in space is assured because of the oblate shape lent to it by the equatorial bulge. Had it been a perfect sphere, it would tend to topple over, time and again, allowing it to tumble all over the place. Earth’s spin, together with its equatorial bulge, turns our world into a gyroscope. A shift in mass would therefore alter its orientation. The amount of adjustment, however, is dictated by the globe’s capacity to deform. Without such distortion, Earth’s axis would at best have been capable of shifting by less than one degree throughout all past geologic ages.",
