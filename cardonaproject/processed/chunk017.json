                    "content": "Since time immemorial, this has never been doubted. Unfortunately, the ancient tales were written down in their present form by early Christian monks who transformed the ancient gods into men of flesh and blood. Such was Balor, he of the single flaming eye, whose name is ultimately derived from 'bhel', thus equivalent to Beli or Bel. He who was once a celestial divinity was turned into a terrestrial king. Despite this metamorphosis, even though the idea has not been widely accepted, the characteristics of Balor have been compared to those of the Sun. That Balor, however, had been a nocturnal sun is indicated by his title. He was known as the King of Night.\n\nThe God of Saturday Night: As befitted his nocturnal station, Osiris was venerated in a festival that took place at night. Herodotus tells us that the grave of Osiris was at Sais in Lower Egypt, and that there was a lake there upon which the sufferings of the god were displayed as a mystery by night. This commemoration of the divine passion was held once a year, and an image of a cow, made of gilt with a golden sun between its horns, was carried out of the chamber in which it stood the rest of the year. A great feature of the festival was the nocturnal illumination. People fastened rows of oil lamps to the outside of their houses, and the lamps burned all night long. This custom was not confined to Sais, but was observed throughout all of Egypt. Another celebration connected with Osiris was the Sed festival, which has been claimed to be the oldest Egyptian feast of which we yet retain a trace. James Frazer has suggested that the ritual, which continued until the end of the Roman period, was as old as Egypt itself. This particular event was held every thirty years, which makes it significant since thirty years is the period of Saturn’s revolution around the Sun. As Frazer himself states, this correlation of the Sed festival with the planet’s revolution has been noted and commented upon by several scholars. Since then, the subject has been revisited by de Santillana and von Dechend, although they present Ptah, rather than Osiris, as the 'inventor' of the festival, even though they identify Ptah as 'the Egyptian Saturn.' The Sed was, of course, a royal jubilee festival which the pharaoh held after having reigned thirty years. Lucky was the pharaoh who could celebrate two such jubilees. Nor was this custom unique to Egypt. The Persian Shahs, who traced their lineage from the towering figures of mythical kings—Kai Kubad, Kai Ka’us, and Kai Khusrau—also celebrated their royal jubilee after having reigned thirty years.",

Later, at the Iseum in Rome, the same Lucius is admitted to the degree of Osiris himself, during which initiation he spends ten days in fasting before being introduced to the nocturnal rites, or orgia, of Osiris. Another nocturnal feast, which is also held in some parts of India when the thirteenth day of a lunar fortnight falls on a Saturday. In Sanskrit, the day of Saturday is called 'Shanivar', translating as 'Saturn’s Day'. Actually, Saturday was the day held sacred to Saturn among several ancient nations and continues to bear the planet’s name not only in Sanskrit. To the Jews, Saturday is Shabbath (the Sabbath), which sometimes said to derive from the closely related 'shabath', meaning 'to repose' or 'to rest.' In fact, however, the Sabbath is named in honor of Saturn, which in Hebrew is called 'Shabtai.' The word 'shabath'—'to repose'—is traceable to the same root, derived because Elohim was said to have rested from creation on that day. In Italian, Saturday is rendered 'Sabato', derived from Hebrew through the Greek 'Sabbaton'. In Maltese, Saturday is called 'Sibt', derived from the same Semitic root. The English name Saturday itself is a contraction of the Saxon 'Saterne’s Day' from the Latin 'Saturni Dies'. Even in Indo-China, and more specifically in Cambodia, Saturday is named in honor of Prah Sau, which is the planet Saturn. Now while it is true that not every ceremony celebrated on a Saturday has to be Saturnian in character or origin, the Indian ceremony mentioned above is called 'Shani Pradosh', as 'pradosh' means 'night', making the festival translatable as 'Saturn’s Night.'",

Of added interest is the fact that, like other festivals of its kind, the feast of Nauroz is celebrated at night; the festivities commence the moment the Sun goes down. Of course, it will be pointed out that, being a New Year’s Eve festival, its celebration at night would be logical. In fact, whether heralded as New Year festivals or not, there is really nothing strange about the fact that Saturnian festivals were conducted at night. After all, in today’s skies, it is at night that Saturn shines, as so it must have shone in ancient times. But, we ask, as a sun? If we are to believe our ancient forefathers, it seems that such was the case. Even if one should disregard all this and assume, against all logic, that such an astronomical fantasy would have, through diffusion, been dispersed around the ancient world and accepted as truth, how can one explain the migration of this idea across the waters of the Atlantic? For, according to Eric Thompson, even in Mesoamerica, we encounter this persistent belief in a night sun. At this point we can add Hypothesis #2.",

                    "content": "As late as 1966, most theories still pictured the planet Jupiter as consisting of a large inner core of ice under enormous pressure. This core was believed to be surrounded by a voluminous ocean of compressed and liquefied gases which, in turn, merged into an atmosphere of hydrogen. It was 'known' that the planet could not be emitting heat from its own internal source. With a core of ice, obviously, this would have been impossible. Thermocouple measurements had detected a very low temperature in the region of -130°C. As with Jupiter, so with Saturn. The similar nature of these two planets was stressed. Temperatures on Saturn were estimated as being extremely low, approximately -150°C. What an embarrassing difference from the picture that emerged less than a year later! Of course, as usual, there was no consensus among astronomers, and some were painting pictures of a Jupiter with a much hotter interior. F. R. Moulton, for example, was speaking of Jupiter’s internal heat as early as 1910. It will not be found stated in current scientific literature, but Immanuel Velikovsky was alluding to both Jupiter and Saturn as 'dark stars' by 1950. This was not based on the scenario of his book, Worlds in Collision, where the statement appeared, but on earlier events presented in a prequel to that work, which remains unpublished. It is not that I uphold either of Velikovsky’s scenarios; I do not. But credit should be given where due. Velikovsky was not alone. By 1962, E. J. Opik had calculated that Jupiter radiated from 1.2 to 2.0 times the energy it receives from the Sun. Ralph Juergens pointed out: 'Indeed, speculation that Jupiter is a dying star, radiating away internal heat, goes back more than a century.'",

'Indeed,' wrote Firsoff, 'Jupiter does emit microwave radiations corresponding to such temperatures.' Allowing for some thermonuclear reactions to proceed at a slow rate in their central regions, and shielded as they are by their vast opaque and cold atmospheres, Firsoff assumed that stellar temperatures could easily obtain inside the Jovian planets. As he concluded: 'They would thus be in the nature of 'potted stars.' By then, even the renowned Gerald Kuiper was referring to Jupiter as a star and the Sun-Jupiter system as a binary. December 3, 1973 is a historical date in the annals of astronomy. On that day, Pioneer 10 passed within 81,000 miles of Jupiter. Exactly one year later, Pioneer 11 skimmed within 27,000 miles of the planet’s south polar region. The new data that these two space probes relayed to Earth sent astronomers and astrophysicists scurrying back to their slide rules and calculations. Observations in the infrared had already indicated that Jupiter was much brighter than would be the case had it merely been a planet reflecting light. D. A. Allen noted that, at 5 mu, Jupiter appeared so bright that it must be radiating more energy than it could absorb from the Sun. 'When the long wavelength data are also included,' wrote Allen, 'we find that Jupiter radiates nearly three times the energy it receives.'",

What applies to Jupiter must therefore also apply to Saturn. Proto-Stars: By late 1980, Voyager 1 did for Saturn what the earlier Pioneers had done for Jupiter. Garry Hunt, the Voyager mission meteorologist, stated: 'We have this paradox of bodies that are somewhat like stars inside but have Earth-like weather on the outside.' It did not, of course, require Voyager 1, or the later Voyager 2, to bring this conclusion home. Writing in 1976, Simmons had already spoken for the scientific community at large when he stated that, like Jupiter, Saturn appears to emit more heat than it receives from the Sun. 'Being further out,' wrote Rick Gore, 'Saturn gets only a fourth the solar energy that Jupiter receives. At Jupiter the solar heat striking the atmosphere is equal to the internal heat coming up. At more distant Saturn, internal heating dominates. The upwelling of this heat may generate the much stronger surface winds. In any event, both planets are a theorist’s delight.' In fact, scientists found that Saturn generates bursts of energy in the one-megahertz frequency range. Gore described Saturn as 'a pale yellow giant, a turbulent ball of primordial gas that more resembles a star than the inner planets we know.' Emmet had earlier expressed similar views. 'Recent observations of the giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn,' he wrote, 'lend credence to earlier speculation that both were actually proto-stars.' Both have a system of accompanying satellites which have been likened to miniature solar systems. Saturn’s temperature was eventually given as 94.4 + 3° K, but this was not the assumed temperature of the planet’s interior. Its total heat emission has been calculated at about 2.2 times higher than its absorbed sunlight. It was then felt that this excess heat cannot be due to residue from the planet’s formative period.",
