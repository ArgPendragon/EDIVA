        "content": "SATURN AS A SUB-BROWN DWARF\nThe similarity with Jupiter does not end with Gliese 229B’s spectrum. Brown dwarfs were eventually discovered to possess stratified clouds much like those on Jupiter, with weather patterns to match, even though Adam Burgasser is of the opinion that “the weather on these more massive brown dwarfs makes the Great Red Spot [on Jupiter] look like a small squall.” Nor are all brown dwarfs as massive as Gliese 229B. Brown dwarfs the size of Jupiter have been posited. As Mark Marley proclaimed: “If you line up a mug shot of Jupiter up with these guys, it is just a very low-mass brown dwarf.” If Jupiter can be considered a low-mass brown dwarf star, then why not Saturn? True enough, Saturn is much less massive than Jupiter, but it might not always have been so. Wallace Thornhill, for one, sees no objection in classifying Saturn as a dwarf star. Just as the demarcation between red and brown dwarfs seems to be arbitrary, so also that between brown dwarfs and giant gaseous planets. The brown dwarf designated 2MASS 0415-0935 “weighs so little that it falls in the range of what astronomers would usually call a giant planet.” Nor is this the only brown dwarf with such featherweight mass. Moreover, a new class of objects have been discovered with such low mass that astronomers are no longer sure what to call them. Knowing what these borderline bodies really are, Frederick Vrba confessed, is not all that obvious “since these objects have the same masses, chemical compositions, and radii as planets.” Alan Boss suggested the term “sub-brown dwarfs” to distinguish them from their more massive siblings. “Give a billion years of cooling and evolution,” Glen Schneider opined, “and these objects may be indistinguishable from planets.” As Maria Zapatero-Osorio stated: “With time, they will look like Jupiter and Saturn.” Our own position is that Saturn had once been such a sub-brown dwarf star carrying Earth with it in axial tandem as its satellite.

        "content": "Reichenbach: The idea that Earth had previously been a satellite of Saturn was later postulated by Immanuel Velikovsky. Brown dwarf stars have a tendency to travel alone in space. Surmised to have been ejected from star-forming regions, these so-called embryos are “destined to spend eternity alone as brown dwarfs.” As Jeffrey Winters reported: “No one knows how many...roaming brown dwarfs there are in nearby space...” This is even truer of sub-brown dwarfs. Taken in consideration with other matters, this has led us to posit that the Saturnian mini-system, Earth included, had probably been wandering out in space outside the domain of the present Solar System. This hypothesis is lent additional weight by one of the most persistent of themes within the universal mytho-historical record which informs us ad nauseam that, during the time when the solitary Saturnian sun hung immobile in Earth’s north celestial pole, the Sun was absent. THE AGE OF DARKNESS. Just as persistent was the ancient belief that, in the beginning, Earth was engulfed in darkness. Again, because this primeval situation is so crucial to our thesis, it would not be amiss to supply additional mytho-historical evidence for its occurrence to what has already been furnished in our previous volume.” The Gnostics, for instance, even believed that the darkness was created, thus giving the impression that it had not always existed.® This late interpretation, however, was derived in a religio-philosophical endeavor to show that everything in existence must have been created by an intelligent designer—which, incidentally, is a concept that seems to be regaining popularity in the modern world even among scientists. But that this primeval darkness had always existed as far as mankind was concerned is borne out by the myths of almost every ancient race and nation. From India we come across a Vedic hymn which relates that: “In the beginning, everything was like a sea without a light.” This is what Heinrich Zimmer has alluded to as “the familiar primeval situation” in Hindu belief—there was only water and the starless night. The Finno-Ugrics recall “a time when the universe was plunged in darkness because neither sun nor moon nor stars as yet shone in the sky.”",

        "content": "THE HABITABLE ZONE\nAdd all the above to what was recounted in our previous volume, and the theme in question becomes more than merely persistent. It was because of this environmental condition, more than anything else, that, among the Polynesians, night was believed to mark the beginning of the world. Life on Earth, it has been said, is only possible because of its location—its distance from the Sun—within the Solar System. Known as the habitable zone, this locality encompasses a narrow orbital belt, which lacks a sharp boundary, somewhere between the planets Venus and Mars. “Very simply, the habitable zone is defined as that region around a star where water—regarded by many as essential for life—exists in liquid form on the surface of a planet long enough to nurture the evolution of life.” Were we closer to Venus, it had once been posited, Earth and all its life-forms would have roasted; closer to Mars, and we would have frozen to death. The above, however, has never really sat well with certain thinkers, among them Frederic Jueneman whose opinion is that “this business about Earth being in a relatively narrow life zone, at an optimal distance from our particular type of star, where climate is balanced between two extremes, is chauvinistic, provincial, and probably nonsense.” To which he added: “It may be nonsense because it is assumed a priori that this is the way things are in the here and now, and therefore this is the way it was and the way it has to be. This kind of thinking is gradually being eroded away by more recent concepts about the possibilities of life on the outer gas giant planets and their satellites.” Besides, as Mark Garlick noted: “The zone’s definition varies from time to time and may not contain strictly all possible life-bearing worlds. For example, the jovian moon Europa is well outside the sun’s habitable zone and yet is regarded by many scientists as one of the two most likely places in the solar system (the other being Mars) where extraterrestrial life might exist.” Earth’s near-circular orbit was also once believed to be indispensable for life, since an elliptical or oval orbit would swing it too close to the Sun at one end, and too far at the other.",
