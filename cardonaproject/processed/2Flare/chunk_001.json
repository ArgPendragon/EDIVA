It is a complete history...of the nature of an intense plasma occurrence in the Solar System as it once was at a time when mankind was present to record it...God Star delineates mythology from fable, setting the former as a true field of scientific enquiry. From God Star springs forth topic after topic on the physical conditions and processes our planet has undergone...” Anthony L. Peratt B.S.E.E., M.S.E.E., Ph.D (Former Scientific advisor, United States Department of Energy) ii",
