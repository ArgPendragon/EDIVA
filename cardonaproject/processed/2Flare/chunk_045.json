        "content": "[They] like flapping pancakes.”? What then visually appears are slightly curved horizontal filamentations at the bottom of the three (or more or less) spheroids. Again according to Peratt, “these actually flap in time” and “can turn upwards or downwards.” The interesting thing here is that there are various pictographs around the world which depict a number of concentricities stacked above each other plus others which show a series of slightly curved, stacked horizontal lines. Just as they appear in laboratory experiments, some of these lines curve downward, others upward. As it happens, the earliest such example (shown opposite) that this writer has so far come across hails from the Magdalenian culture of Saint-Marcel in France. A mere 5.5 centimeters long, the object on which the depiction is engraved has been described as a pendant “with circular motifs,” which, given the uniqueness of the subject represented, is very understandable. When shown to Peratt, he had no trouble recognizing it for what it is. Even so, had this been the only item from the Magdalenian culture that bears a close resemblance to a columnar plasma instability, I would have hesitated to include it in this work. But there is more. In fact it seems that the Magdalenians were so mesmerized by the instabilities they saw the polar column transform into, that they depicted just about the entire sequence—and this, no matter what criticisms will be leveled at it in the future, is surely too much to be relegated to coincidence. Three other items from the same Magdalenian culture, but this time from Isturitz, also in France, continue the sequence of columnar disruption. Described as “bone or antler tools decorated with spiral patterns,” Peratt easily recognized them as patterns of instabilities in a plasma column which also appear “on a world-wide basis.” The first item (Fig. 1, on p. 270) shows the spheroids and spirals just beginning to separate and unravel. In sequence, this would follow the event depicted on the so-called pendant from Saint-Marcel. The second one (Fig. 2) continues to show the unraveling in which the spirals are now almost beyond recognition. The third (Fig. 3), which Peratt calls “the most complicated,” would have occurred “sometime after a long-lasting stability,” and involves “an intense symmetrical magnetic crush along the whole column.” Peratt thus described the depictions on the three items in question: “Each column, or bone, represents one instant in time of the column instability development. Time changes are not shown on any one stick or bone.” Moreover, Peratt offered the additional information that the complex pattern depicted in the third object would have occurred “at a time appreciably greater than the time difference.”",

        "content": "between the [other two instabilities].”! He was astute enough to realize, without actually having been told, that these three items are “probably all of the same age,” that is “all carved about the same time,” as in fact they are. More than that, they seem to have been carved by the same hand. If that turns out to be the case, it would strengthen my own belief that they were carved by an eye-witness and that the entire sequence could not have lasted more than a person’s lifetime. When asked how long each of the instabilities depicted on these items could have lasted, Peratt was of the opinion that the item shown in the middle (Fig. 2) depicted the instability-event 10 years after that recorded in the one to the left (Fig. 1), The last one of the three (Fig. 3), depicts the instability-event that would have followed 50 years after the one shown in the middle This, then, again bespeaks an instability-sequence that would have taken place within the span of a person’s lifetime. The time taken for the instabilities to pass from one phase to the other are calculated through the scaling up from laboratory experiments. Because of this, Peratt himself does not accept this author’s surmise and opts for a much longer time-span—even centuries. As he explains, experimentally, plasmas have been found to scale over fourteen orders of magnitude. Earlier, Alfvén had even hypothesized that they scale up to twenty-eight orders of magnitude. Once the amplitude of an experimental plasma, or its instability, is known, its size in the laboratory and the time it lasts can be scaled up to cosmic parameters. Also, once a criterion is altered in a computer simulation, the programmed model has the ability to adjust all the others. If, for instance, the magnitude, the strength of the current, the magnetic field, etc., of a plasma is known and entered into the program’s code, the other parameters, such as the length of time involved in each phase of the plasma’s instability sequence, will be output by the computer. There might, however, be something of a pitfall inherent in such scaling. As Warren Carey admonished, “a small correction may become significant, even overwhelming, when length or time becomes large.” As he continues: “Where parameters involve different powers of size or time, change of scale affects one property more than another. Thus the most successful airplane design, if faithfully copied at twice the size, could not fly. The weight would have been increased eight times, but the wing area to support it only four times. A double-size airplane can of course be built, but not to the same proportions.”",

[However] as different plasma parameters obey different scaling laws, translation from one region to another is often difficult.” Moreover, Alfvén cautioned those who were to follow him to give precedence to plasma behavior over that of scaling. “Hence,” he wrote, “laboratory experiments should aim at clarifying a number of basic phenomena of importance in cosmic physics rather than trying to reproduce a scaled-down version of the cosmic example.” Needless to say, this does not imply that Peratt is necessarily wrong.

        "content": "be exercised. Judging by the nature of the Magdalenian items discussed, to say nothing of the demands of the mytho-historical record itself, I must opt for a much shorter time for the instability sequence discussed above. After all, even Peratt’s own calculations of 10 and 50 years, as noted, would seem to point in that direction. THE MIRROR IMAGE Meanwhile, there is yet one more item that fits the sequence being discussed. This one comes from the Epipaleolithic period, which is intermediate between the Paleolithic and Neolithic, and thus includes the Magdalenian culture with which we are concerned. Discovered in north-west Germany, the item, described merely as a decorated point, depicts a design that was to become quite prevalent in later ages. Peratt was not quite sure whether this type of instability should follow the one depicted in Fig. 2 or Fig. 3 of the Isturitz trio we have just examined. Even in face of all the above, what is depicted on this particular item seems much too neat and symmetrically uniform to have represented an actual plasma instability the likes of which are necessarily ephemeral. Be it understood, however, that while these instabilities are transitory, some of their displayed aspects can be sustained for long periods of time. Not only that, but, as seen in laboratory experiments, quite a few of the patterns they form look almost artificial. One thing to keep in mind is that, eventually, plasma instabilities tend to result in repetitive linear configurations. And, to be sure, the pattern depicted on the Magdalenian item from Germany shown on page 273 is one that often results in experimental instabilities. While, at the time of this writing, Peratt hesitated in committing himself as to whether this particular instability would have preceded or followed the one depicted in Fig. 3 on page 270, I am of the opinion that it would have followed it. My reason for this is that if one looks closely at selective portions of Fig. 3, one can see that the pattern depicted on the German item under consideration is just beginning to take shape. And, as if to complement this situation, curlicues similar to those depicted on Fig. 3 appear at both the top and bottom of the German item. This seems to indicate a transitional phase between the two instabilities. This particular image impressed ancient man so much that, perhaps because it was to reappear at a later time, he continued to reproduce it on various surfaces through the coming ages. Interpreting it as a ladder to heaven, and even as an assemblage of men standing, or piled up, one on top of the other—both of which, to some extent, the pattern resembles—it was to gain special religious significance. In later ages, separate constituents of the pattern were separated into individual representations which were then interpreted as various items—a person (especially in a praying position), a dragonfly, a frog, a water skate, even a cloud (with its reflection in the water)—to which, in the eye of primitive man, the image bore a resemblance. Further, because the isolated constituents appear the same whether viewed normally or upside down,",

Of special interest to our thesis is the fact that this very same image was adopted by the Dogon of Mali in west Africa as one of their most important religious symbols. They incorporated it both in one of their principal ceremonial masks, as also on their constructions. The image itself is claimed to represent their god Amma, the creator who had existed during the “original darkness,” who had created the heavens, and organized the “world” out of chaos. The reader should therefore have no difficulty in recognizing these characteristics as belonging to the Saturnian deity. Like other nations they, too, retained a memory of the world axis that once reached from Earth and pointed toward what is now the Pole Star. This axis was known to them as Amma’s Pillar.",
