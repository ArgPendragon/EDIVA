It all started as simple as that. The information concerning what primitive man saw in heaven was derived from the mytho-historical record of ancient races. Despite the fact that our thesis was supported by astrophysical, geological, and palaeontological evidence, objections against our methodology were not entirely put to rest. Myth, it has been stressed time and again, has no place in science. But, more than science, we are here concerned with history and, as that great comparative mythologist Mircea Eliade aptly phrased it, true history is myth! — which is to say that, as far as our primitive forefathers were concerned, history began with myth. This is because, prior to the founding of the first civilizations, primitive man had no incentive to preserve the past actions of his own kind but, for reasons soon to become evident, he was obsessed by what transpired in the sky, the domain of influence in which his capricious deities lived and died. Why should we believe what myths proclaim?—it has been asked. Are not myths simply that, fanciful tales of miraculous events, devoid of any reality? As P. Vayne asked in relation to Greek mythology: “What is to be made of this mass of nonsense? How can all this have a meaning, a motivation, a function, or at least a structure? The question of whether myths have an authentic content can never be put in positive terms.”? Or, as Ev Cochrane also asked: “Why should anyone care about ancient myth?” Cochrane, however, replied to his own question by stating that: “The answer, quite simply, is that for untold centuries myth served as the primary means of recording and communicating man’s fundamental ideas regarding the nature of the cosmos and the sacred. In this sense, ancient myth represents an intellectual heirloom encapsulating the history of our species and is thus a ripe field of study for all students of evolutionary psychology. If, as appears to be the case, myth also pre-",

        "content": "Serves important clues for reconstructing the recent history of our solar system, its study becomes all the more essential.””! Some myths do contain what seems to be an element of incredibility. For that reason, myth has often been interpreted on an allegorical level, as it continues to be to the present, especially among modern affluent cults. As Martin Bernal noted in relation to Egyptian mythology, “the allegorical interpretation of myth as an expression of the ancient wisdom of the Egyptian priests survived and flourished among Freemasons and Rosicrucians.”? More often than not, however, the cursory reader of mythological works is simply bowled over by the myths’ complexity and magical content. Ignatius Donnelly long ago remarked that: “Legend has one great foe to its perpetuation—civilization. Civilization brings with it a contempt for everything which it cannot understand; skepticism becomes the synonym for intelligence; men no longer repeat—they doubt, they dissect, they sneer, they reject...If the myth survives this treatment, the poets take it up and make it their stock-in-trade—they decorate it in a masquerade of frippery and finery, feathers and furbelows, like a clown dressed for a fancy ball...and the poor barbarian legend survives at last, if it survives at all, like...a hippopotamus smothered in flowers, jewels and laces...” Myth must then be interpreted, when it needs interpreting at all, after it has been stripped clean of its “frippery and finery, feathers and furbelows,” its “flowers, jewels and laces.” In other words, it is the core of a myth that should concern us and not the trimmings it might have acquired in later times. That modern man has no use for myth is somewhat ironical when one remembers that those of a religious mind, regardless of their particular persuasion, often find themselves immersed in mythic ritual. These might not realize it, but religious ritual is nothing more than the re-enactment of myth. Hodder Westropp and Staniland Wake were right on the mark when they proclaimed that, together with language, worship is nothing more than crystallized history4— which compares well with Eliade’s own dictum mentioned above. As the same Eliade also avowed, “the greater part of primitive man’s actions were, so he thought, simply the repetition of a primeval action accomplished at the beginning of time by a divine being, or mythical figure.”> In other words, ritual, including sacrifice, is the re-enactment of past mythic events, and this remains true to the present, regardless of whatever religion is involved. In the Greek world, ritual also developed into drama, from which it can be said that drama owes its origin to mythic ritual. More than that, as we indicated in our previous vol-",

        "content": "Ume on this subject,! Greek drama, for which such magnificent theatres were built, originated from the mythic ritual concerned with one particular deity— Dionysos. As Rush Rehm noted: “The first theatrical productions were probably also connected with the worship of the wine-god Dionysus [variant: Dionysos]. From paintings on vases (often wine vessels), we know that initiates in the Dionysiac cult sometimes danced around an image of the god attached to a tree or pole. These mask-like visages of Dionysus may have influenced the use of masks by actors and the chorus... “The Greeks adopted Dionysus as the god of their theatre, and tragic and comic performances took place at city-sponsored festivals held in his honor. The biggest festival, held at the City Dionysia (the sanctuary to Dionysus), took place every spring in Athens, where large audiences gathered over several days. The close link to Dionysus gives some support to a theory about drama’s origins [which was] popular earlier this century...”? This is ascertained by the aforementioned Bernal in his contemplation of the origins of Greek theatre. “It is striking to note,” he wrote, “that in Greece, tragedy, which was essentially religious, was associated with both Dionysos and the goat, tragos.”3 In fact it is from the Greek word for “goat”—that is, tragos—which animal was sacred to Dionysos, that the word “tragedy” is derived. All of which is quite revealing because, besides being the god of wine and revelry, as we indicated in our previous volume, Dionysos originated as the anthropomorphized representation of the planet Saturn.+ The Classical Greeks came relatively late on the mythological scene. This, however, does not mean that their deities were of Classical manufacture. As Peter James and his co-authors revealed: “The decipherment of Linear B [a Mycenaean script] threw a completely new light on the Mycenaean world. For example, it is now known that the Olympian gods familiar from Homer (including Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Athena, Artemis, Hermes and Dionysos) were [already being] worshipped during the late Bronze Age.”> Even so, way ahead of the Greeks were the civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia. The major mythic themes with which the scholar is now familiar are, however, even more ancient than that. As Donald Mackenzie reported, the major myths of the ancient world trace all the",

He compares writing to painting —paintings look like living beings, but if you ask them a question, they are mute. If you ask written words a question, you get the same answer over and over. Writing cannot distinguish between suitable and unsuitable readers: it can be ill-treated or unfairly abused, but it cannot defend itself. In contrast, truths found in the art of dialectic can defend themselves. Thus, the spoken is superior to the written word!”?

One mistake in recitation would have meant disaster for the tribe.””! And—from Tom Lowenstein and Piers Vitebsky: “For native audiences, myths were far from being fantastic ‘fairytales’...Rather, stories were seen as accounts of real events that took place at the dawn of time. The purpose of myths and legends was both to instruct and to entertain...Storytelling occupied a seminal position in Native American cultures. It was not a purely spoken art: singing and drumming were often involved.”? Likewise with the Polynesian people. Even that for-long mysterious script known as rongorongo, which the natives of Rapanui, or Easter Island, are known to have employed, does not date farther back than the late nineteenth century 3 “The Rapanui people had no need for a script [Steven Fischer, the man who finally decoded the inscriptions declared]. No Polynesian—indeed none of the three-million- odd inhabitants of Oceania in the eighteenth century, needed a writing system. Oral traditions and knot records had served these peoples well in this regard for thousands of years.”+ In the Society Islands, entire colleges of priestly teachers instructed the people in their ancient mythology, religious rites, and even poetic compositions. These teachers, drawn from priestly families, had themselves to undergo a strict training program before being allowed to practice and teach. They even had to endure a period of retreat which was followed by an oral examination before a group of elders. Tony Allan and his co-authors tell that one island, Opoa, “became such a centre of religious learning that it drew European comparisons with Mecca and Rome—as well as the less complimentary epithet, ‘the metropolis of idolatry’.” Similar schools also existed in Hawaii. With this universal oral tradition stretching back to prehistoric times, one begins to wonder how tales told in one part of the world ended up being similar, sometimes near-identical, to tales in other parts which would at the time have been far removed from cultural contact. Although not the subject of the present work, one such tale that comes easily to mind is the well known misadventure of Phaethon, son of Helios, who, having driven his father’s chariot across the sky, lost control of it and ended up burning the Earth below. In the end, Zeus was forced to intervene by dispatching one of his terrible thunderbolts with which he smote",
