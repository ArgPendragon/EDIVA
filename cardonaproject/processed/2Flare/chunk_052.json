        "content": "FINAL WORDS FROM OCEANIA The sacred precinct was constructed in honor of the god. The rites of Dionysus closely resembled those of the Egyptian god Osiris. Herodotus believed the Greek rites were borrowed and modified from the Egyptians. From the non-Maya lands of South America comes a tale which bears a striking similarity to the freeing of light from Adoil. A. Metraux relates it in the following words: “Here is the tale of creation as told by the Chibcha Indians of Colombia. When it was dark, before anything in the world existed, light was enclosed in something big, which the Muiscas called ‘Chiminagua.’ This thing called Chiminagua—by which they mean ‘god’—rose to become bright and to free the light that was in it. Then with the emergence of this light things began to be created.” FINAL WORDS FROM OCEANIA To the Maori of New Zealand, the light-emitting deity was known as Io. Of him it was said: “Io dwelt within the breathing-space of immensity. The Universe was in darkness, with [celestial] water everywhere. There was no glimmer of dawn, no clearness, no light. And he began by saying these words— ‘Darkness become a light-possessing darkness.’ And at once light appeared.” Rituals commemorating the emission of the light by Io were still being conducted in the twentieth century (as, perhaps, they are still being conducted to this day). Thus, according to Hare Hongi: “The words by which Io fashioned the universe—that is to say, by which it was implanted and caused to produce a world of light—the same words are used in the ritual for implanting a child in a barren womb. The words by which Io caused light to shine in the darkness are used in the rituals for cheering a gloomy and despondent heart, the feeble aged, the decrepit; for shedding light into secret places and matters, for inspiration in song-composing and in many other affairs, affecting man to despair in times of adverse war. For such ritual includes the words [used by Io] to overcome and dispel darkness.” Among the Ngaitahu of New Zealand’s southern island, the light-emitting deity was known as Po. (In Hawaii, however, Po was the manifestation of the primeval darkness.>) This Po was said to have “begat Light, who begat Day-light, who begat enduring Light.”6",

        "content": "Similarly in Hawaii where we meet with the god Kane (or Tane) who, like the Saturnian deities of other nations, existed alone in a deep intense night.! Like the Roman Janus and the Eskimo Ataksak, Tane (some say Atea) “was at first a shapeless being.” As in the myths we have been discussing, the first thing that Kane created was light. The Tahitians had much to say about the age of darkness. “All was darkness,” they in- toned in one of their Creation chants, “it was continuous, thick darkness.”4 And in this dark- ness there existed Ta’aroa. “But there was Ta’aroa, and he alone.”> Known as the “night of Rumia,” the age of darkness was said to have existed from time immemorial. “The night of Rumia...was a long night to name; it was thick darkness, the long night to name. The nights would be millions in the long night to name, it was the long, wearisome night, the night of Rumia!”6 Eventually, however, “Atea was free, and light came into the world.” The exuberance ex- perienced at the shedding of the light is then somewhat whimsically recounted in the follow- ing: “There was tumbling and rolling over each other, in the ravines, in that department and this department.’ In what departments? In the assembly room and the room to run from! They all dispersed outside, shouting and clinging one to the other! The host of gods from their department first, and then the host of people from their department a little afterwards. This was the ending of the millions of nights of the long night of Rumia.”® The age of darkness had come to an end.",

        "content": "VELIKOVSKY’S ORIGINAL SCENARIO Chapter 15 Exploding Stars and Planets VELIKOVSKY’S ORIGINAL SCENARIO as proto-Saturn’s flare-up a unique event? Because it was Immanuel Velikovsky who first intuited that proto-Saturn had flared up in a brilliant outburst of light, we should at least mention in brief what he believed to have been the cause for the event. Right from the start, Velikovsky claimed that the flare in question was due to proto-Saturn’s eruption as a nova,! which claim he continued to uphold until his death.2 The cause for this eruption, however, was blamed by him on a near-encounter between proto-Saturn and the planet Jupiter. “Such a scenario would explain the prominence of Saturn prior to its cataclysmic disruption and dismemberment...At some point, during a close approach to Jupiter, Saturn became unstable; and, as a result of the influx of extraneous material, it exploded, flaring as a nova which, after subsiding, left a remnant that the ancients still recognized as Saturn, even though it was but a fraction of the size of the celestial body of earlier days.”+ This near-encounter was utilized by Ralph Juergens, despite the fact that his own version for the cause of proto-Saturn’s flare-up did not require it. Velikovsky, of course, based his hypothesis on what he knew of mythology, but, unfortu- nately, the mytho-historical record does not uphold him on this particular issue. Now it is true that there are various mythological tales which others might utilize, as some have actually done, as evidence in support of Velikovsky’s contention. Among them we could enumerate the cutting to pieces of Osiris by Set, the beheading of Brahma by Shiva (whom Velikovsky had misidentified as a personification of Jupiter), and the dethroning of Kronos by Zeus. But, whether as Osiris, Brahma, or Kronos, in none of the above myths is Saturn said to have shed a light when attacked by his antagonist. And since the shedding of the light by proto-Saturn is",

        "content": "the ingredient we are presently concerned with, we will have to allot the various celestial combats intimated in the above myths to some other, and later, Saturnian disruption.! Besides, as we noted in our previous chapter, no perpetrator, no antagonist, is encountered in the records concerning the emission of light which heralded Creation. There was no other deity to attack or clash with Saturn. On the contrary, as we have seen, the god who is said to have emitted the light was almost universally described as having been alone. Velikovsky missed this point because, as already stated, he failed to recognize proto-Saturn’s flare-up as the fiat lux of Genesis. Had he done so, he would have been on firmer ground. Instead, he saw in this explosion of proto-Saturnian light the cause behind the Universal Deluge.? Basing his deductions on the Old Testament, he concluded that proto-Saturn’s flare-up occurred seven days before the waters of the Deluge hit Earth—a topic to which we shall return in its proper chronological place in a future volume. In the meantime, in view of Velikovsky’s claim that the flare-up under discussion was due to Saturn’s outburst as a nova, and in order to leave no stone unturned, we shall turn our attention to the nature of novae and supernovae. NOVAE AND SUPERNOVAE The name stella nova, that is “new star,” was coined to describe stellar flares in pre-tele- scopic days when it was still believed that such stars came into sudden existence only to dis- appear again without a trace. “Sometimes where nothing was seen before, we witness the sudden and unexpected appearance of a star destined perhaps to outshine all the others in the sky before dropping back into obscurity,” a 1966 encyclopedia tells us. “At one time the bursting of a nova, as it is called, would be greeted by the populace with much trepidation, but nowadays it merely provides astronomers with a great many interesting problems.”3 Although some novae dim in a matter of months, others have been known to take as much as 20 to 30 years to revert to their original dimness.4 One of the finest examples of the twentieth century was Nova Aquilae which, on June 7, 1918, suddenly exploded in an outburst which increased its brightness from magnitude 11 to magnitude 6 in the same evening, and to magnitude 1 by the following evening. It continued to brighten until, for a few hours during the night of June 9/10, it attained a magnitude of -1.4 when it outshone every other star visible at the time. Its brightness was calculated to have increased 70,000 times in just three days. Its splendor, however, was short-lived and, thereafter, it continued to fade night after night. Even so, it did not reach its original low magnitude until six years later in 1924.5",

            "1. The mytho-historical evidence that Velikovsky himself used to uphold his claim include some mythological identities that he would not have proposed were it not for the fact that the lack of data forced him to them. Thus, Isis is identified by him both as the planet Venus and as Jupiter (Worlds in Collision, p. 74; “On Saturn and the Flood,” p. 6). He then did likewise with Horus, the son of Isis and Osiris (“Saturn and the Flood,” loc. cit.; Worlds in Collision, p. 174). But no clash between Osiris/Saturn and Isis or Horus is met with in Egyptian mythology. Nor can the identification of Isis as the planet Jupiter be validated through any means.",

The cause of these flare-ups, both novae and su- pernovae, had to be sought elsewhere. In 1966, this cause was still elusive. “The origin of the nova-phenomenon [as well as that of the supernova] must without doubt be looked for within the star itself, even though the precise mechanism of the outbursts is at present still unknown.”! Although it was soon discovered that stars that flare up were members of a binary system, the exact cause of their outbursts remained a mystery. In the meantime, despite the fact that proto-Saturn would not have been as massive as a star, at close proximity the flare-up should still have been a little too close for comfort. How, then, did Earth escape annihilation? Once again we look to supernovae to see what is believed to happen to those bodies whose stellar partners tend to flare up. The long-term timing of the oscillations emitted by pulsars, which is what the remnant stars of supernovae are called, led astronomers to believe “that these objects may have one or more small planetary companions.”? During the 1980s, Carl Sagan could already conceive the possibility that “a planet could survive the evolution of a star into a pulsar”3— that is, sur- vive the explosion emitted by a supernova. A stellar outburst, dubbed SN1987a, appeared in the Large Magellanic Cloud during that year. Astronomers, however, had to wait two years for the star that gave it birth to appear as a pulsar. When it did, a problem surfaced with it. The star was pulsing at about 2,000 times a second. At one pulse per revolution, this meant that, at its equator, the pulsar was rotating at more than one-third the speed of light. At such speed the pulsar should have flown apart. Joseph Taylor then suggested that the blips might be coming once every half-revolution, which would imply that the pulsar was spinning “at an acceptable rate of once per millisecond.” Jerome Kristian did not agree, arguing that the pulses, in such a case, should differ slightly, whereas they were noted to be identical. Additionally, the pulse frequency varied “almost imperceptibly” in a regular pattern. One possible explanation for this, according to Sam Flam- steed, would be a Jupiter-sized body orbiting the pulsar “at close range.” Were that the case, the object’s gravity would cause the pulsar to wobble, and this, in turn, would cause the variance in the pulse frequency+— which is the well-known Doppler effect through which extra- solar planets are now being detected. By 1994, such claims had become common. Thus two Russian astronomers claimed that the pulsar from a supernova dated to have occurred 5 million years ago harbored not one, but two planets orbiting around it.
