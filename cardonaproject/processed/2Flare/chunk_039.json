        "content": "Equated Shiva with their own Dionysos, whose Saturnian identity has already been indicated. But what of Hindu lore itself? In the Linga Purana, Shiva is alluded to as “the Purusha.” In Sanskrit, Purusha translates as “Supreme Being,” with the connotation of “first” or “primary.” This accords with the belief of other nations in that the Saturnian deity was the first and, for a time, the only god visible in the primordial sky. It also accords well with the hoary practice of placing the Saturnian deity at the head of all ancient pantheons. Shiva was considered “the overlord of the waters” and “glorified as such.” But “the waters,” it was also said, constitute the abode of Vishnu, whom we have earlier seen floating on these very waters. The god known as Hari-Hara, however, combines Shiva and Vishnu into one and the same deity. This is further complemented by the fact that both Shiva and Vishnu share the same epithet of Sarva. The Linga Purana also equates Shiva with Vishnu. Actually, as Heinrich Zimmer informs us: “...in the earlier and classic Puranas, Shiva is no more than a function or mask assumed by Vishnu whenever the moment approaches for the reabsorption of the universe. Only in a later stratification of Puranic myth do we find Shiva coming to the fore to enact independently and alone all three of the great world roles of creation, preservation, and destruction.” The same passage in the Linga Purana which links Shiva to Rudra also equates Shiva with Brahma, whose identity as Saturn has already been documented. Now it is true that the Puranas are of relatively recent date, with some of them being as tardy as the 10th century A.D. Not only that, but the Linga Purana itself was abridged by Krishna Dvaipayana. As the translators of the 1973 edition of this work inform us: “The abridgement was a natural course, for the old contents ceased to appeal to later generations. At the same time, fresh material was available which the new compilers",

The process continued till the beginning of the fifth century A.D. when the bulk of this Purana was settled to its present form.” It is also no secret that the Puranas were compiled “for the purpose of promoting some special, locally prevalent form of Brahmanical belief.” While most of them exhibit a certain Vaishnava tendency —i.e., a tendency to elevate Vishnu above the other two members of the Trimurti—it is quite obvious that the Linga Purana is strictly Saiva: From beginning to end it lauds the niskala and sakala (attributes and characteristics) of the Lord Shiva. Be all that as it may, the term purana itself signifies “old” and it was originally applied “to prehistoric, especially cosmogonic, legends.” In other words, regardless of how late these “legends” were put into writing, they still derive from great antiquity. It is not hidden from anyone that Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva form a trinity, with Brahma as the Creator, Vishnu as the Preserver, and Shiva as the Destroyer of the so-called “world.” It was well understood by the ancients that these three divinities, collectively known as the Trimurti, were in reality three gods in one. Additionally, just as the Greek Kronos, when rendered “Chronos,” means “Time,” so does Shiva’s title of Kala. Moreover, Kala was itself a name of the planet Saturn. Thus when Shiva is designated as Kala, he is unambiguously identified as Saturn. Soma is one more name of Shiva, but also an epithet of Yama. More than that, Shiva himself is also known as Yama-antakah. That Yama was a name of Saturn is well known. A common epithet of Shiva is Sthanu, which has the meaning of “pillar” or “post,” which fits well with the heaven-sustaining pillar and/or post of our present topic. Although this is the meaning of Sthanu most often stressed by Indologists, sthanu also translates as “firm, fixed, steady, stable, immovable, and motionless,” which conforms with the immobility of the proto-Saturnian sun. Another name of Shiva is Achala which, as a noun, translates as “seven,” the sacred number mostly associated with Saturn. But, as an adjective, achala again means “steady, immovable, motionless, fixed, and permanent.” Sthirah, derived from sthira, also means",

Yet another epithet of Shiva is Dhruva, and since Dhruva is also the name of the Pole Star, this designation obviously alludes to proto-Saturn’s north celestial polar station. This is further strengthened by the fact that Saturn’s avatar of Vishnu also bears the same epithet. This is unambiguously reflected in Shiva’s additional epithet of Madhyastha, which is derived from the words madhya, meaning “middle” or “central,” and sthah, meaning “place”—thus “middle and/or central place.” Now while some of the above characteristics of Shiva—although by no means all—as well as others we will be presently presenting, might be shared by other planetary deities, the totality of them is enough to cast away any doubts concerning the original identity of the god as a personification of proto-Saturn.",

Shiva, however, is even called Dhumaketu (name #629) which actually means “comet.” In view of all this, it might rightly be asked why Shiva’s identity as Saturn should be given preference at the expense of Mars, and even other celestial bodies, with which he also seems to be associated. But, in view of the sectarian bias of the Linga Purana, it is obvious that Shiva was assimilated with just about every celestial body, other than Venus and Jupiter,",

        "content": "in order to demonstrate his divine omni-form as, to be sure, Ganesha Natu himself claims! Is this not, in fact, borne out by the Linga Purana itself in which Shiva is also called Sarvadevamaya (name #893 and #949), which means “identical with all Devas,” and Sarvalakshana (name #866), “one who has all characteristics”? In reality, rather than being the same as Karttikeya/Mars, Shiva was actually his father. But then, again, how can we be sure that Shiva’s identity as Saturn does not stem from the same cause. Preference for a Saturnian identification of Shiva originates in those epithets which, without calling on Saturn itself or any other celestial body, compare favorably with the universal characteristics of the mythological Saturnian sun. Among the “thousand and eight” names of Shiva, these epithets proliferate. This indicates that Shiva’s identity as Saturn predominates. In clarifying this very problem, Roger Ashton had recourse to a different, but just as valid, argument: “In the instances of Kala, Raivata, Sthira, and Yama [which are all epithets of Shiva], no planet other than Saturn is mentioned. It could [therefore] be assumed that the original linkage is shown by this one class of clues rather than by several others. Given this, Shiva’s real link is to Saturn, while others are misleading.” This is especially apparent in the feast of Shani-Pradosh, celebrated by the Hindus when the thirteenth day of a lunar fortnight falls on a Saturday. As is well known, Saturday is named in honor of the Saturnian deity, the name being derived from the Saxon Saterne’s Day (or Daeg), through the Latin Saturni Dies. The day of Saturday was held sacred to Saturn among the peoples of various other nations, including the Jews, Arabs, Maltese, the Latins, and Indo-Chinese. And so, also, among the Hindus, whose name for Saturday is Shanivar, derived from Shani, which is probably the most common Sanskrit name of the planet Saturn. Shanivar thus translates as “Saturn’s Day.” Now on the night of Shani-Pradosh there occurs a worship of no other than Shiva. Pradosh means “night.” Shani-Pradosh thus translates as “Saturn’s Night.” It is not reasonable to assume that a deity honored in a festival called Saturn’s Night, occurring in the evening of Saturn’s Day, is not himself a personification of the same Saturn. Otherwise this would be akin to claiming that the Christian feast of Christmas is not held in honor of Christ. Besides which, Shani, the name of the planet Saturn, is yet one more epithet of Shiva.",

        "content": "AJA EKAPAD We can now return to the pillar of light that was inter alia visualized as the single leg of the deity. We have also already noted Shiva’s epithet of Sthanu, which has the meaning of “pillar” or “post.” Kilah, yet another name of Shiva, likewise means “pillar.” But Shiva was also designated as Ekapada, which means “lame.” As Aja Ekapad, however, he is the “one-footed” support of the sky. That this lameness was attributable to the Saturnian planetary god is evidenced in a myth in which Shani, that is the planet Saturn, was lamed by Parvati for having killed her son. And yet, in a different version of the myth, it was Shiva who molested Parvati’s son. Besides his lameness, as an ascetic Shiva is also portrayed as standing on his right leg, with his left being held by a strap which he holds in his right arm. To this day, Shivaites and Sadhus still adopt this posture and hold it for long periods of time as a form of devotion to their god. It is doubtful that they know it, but in adopting this stance they are actually imitating the one-legged posture of the primordial Saturnian sun. In order not to portray the deity in his deformity, Shiva is also sometimes depicted sitting with one leg tucked under or in front of him, with the other dangling straight below. The leg, or foot, that is the cosmic pillar, is also commemorated in the Hindu ritual involving the raising of the sacred stake known as the Yupa. As this stake is raised, the priest intones the words: “With thy crest thou hast touched the sky; with thy middle thou hast filled the air; with thy foot thou has steadied the earth.” It is, however, the ancients’ rendition of this pillar of light as the god’s phallus that will retain our interest for the remainder of this chapter since, as we shall soon see, it will become of special importance in the unfolding of the events that brought the Ice Age to an end. THE MAHA LINGA As we have shown in our previous volume, “the downward flow of light from above,” was visualized by some as a cosmic phallus. In Egypt, Osiris was considered the phallus of the same Ra. We find this stated in a liturgical tract contained in the Papyrus of Ani which is presented in the form of questions and answers. “Who is this?” it is there asked. And the answer is given: “It is Osiris. Others, however, say that his name is Ra, and that the god who dwelleth in Amentet [that is, Osiris] is the phallus of Ra, wherewith he had union with himself.” At this point, the slight ambiguity in the above liturgy as to whether Osiris and Ra were one and the same deity, or whether one was considered merely a particular feature belonging to the other, should not surprise the reader. But besides being the phallus of Ra, Osiris was also believed to have boasted of his own. In fact, Osiris’ member seems to have been so popular with the Egyptian population that the Greek biographer, Plutarch, could assert that the god “was everywhere represented with the phallus exposed.” The deity known as Aai is presented as a phallus god, but, at the same time, Aai is also one of the forms of Ra. Similarly, Rehu is a god identified with the phallus of Osiris, but Rehu is also a form of Shu, whom we had also earlier presented as the heaven-sustaining deity. In Indic lore, it is Shiva who is mainly connected with the phallus, known there as the linga or lingam. Shiva is not, however, the only deity associated with the heavenly phallus. One of the meanings of the name Prajapati, the Creator, translates as the male organ of generation. That Prajapati is also to be equated with Saturn we have indicated in our previous volume. Among most mythologists, the lingam is usually represented as a symbol of fertility, as is apparent in the writings of Veronica Ions. In speaking of the Dravidians, the non-Aryan peoples of southern India and Ceylon, Ions presented them as an agricultural people who “worshipped gods connected in one way or another with fertility.” Typical of this, according to her, was phallic worship at Harappa. Elsewhere she speaks of the “fertility-giving aspect of Shiva,” whose “supreme creative power is celebrated in the worship of the lingam or phallus,” which personal attribute “characterizes Shiva as a god of fertility.” De Wilman-Grabowska also presents Shiva as a “God of fecundity” being worshipped “in the shape of the linga.” Mircea Eliade, on the other hand, was somewhat more inclusive when he stated that: “It is very likely that among those who adore the lingam of Siva, a great many see it only as an archetype of the generative organ; but there are others who look to it as a",

The ritualistic raising of the Yupa symbolizes the establishment of this cosmic axis, connecting the heavens and the earth.

Thus, Shiva’s lingam embodies both the creative and sustaining forces of the universe, aligning with the Saturnian attributes of stability and permanence.",

        "content": "sign, an ‘image’ of the rhythmic creation and destruction of the universe which expresses itself in forms, and periodically returns to its primal, pre-formal unity, before being reborn.” When Eliade asks which is the true meaning, he replies that “both are equally valuable.” They may both be valuable for the study of religion, but, as will be made apparent in the very next chapter, it is the second interpretation, that of “rhythmic creation and destruction,” that accords with the cosmogonical account. Thus, for instance, like Shiva himself, his lingam was also called dhruva—“the fixed, or immovable”—an obvious reference to proto-Saturn’s immobility and that of the jet-like axis emanating from it. It should not, however, be forgotten that Dhruva is the Sanskrit name for the North Star. This, then, explains why, among the Evenks, who belong to the Tungus group of Siberia, the name of the North Star translates as “the middle of the universe.” True enough, as the center of the northern sky, this name might be thought of as an appropriate one. But to another Tungus group, the North Star is known as “the pillar,” which is hardly descriptive of the star in question. As Edwin Krupp correctly surmised, this pillar “is the cosmic axis” that connects heaven to Earth. Like Krupp, Zimmer likewise recognized that Shiva’s “fiery lingam is a form of the Axis Mundi” which can be equated “with the shaft of light” that penetrates Earth. Like Krupp, and so many others, he, too, misinterpreted this “shaft of light,” presenting it as “the Ray that extends from the Sun above.” He should have realized that the sun is anything but fixed or immovable, and that it radiates more than a single ray of light. Ananda Coomaraswamy has also indicated that: “The axis of the universe is coincident also with the fiery Shiva-lingam.” Yet even here, the word “universe” is misleading since what was originally meant was proto-Saturn’s special “cosmos.” There is one telling and oft-repeated myth concerning Shiva’s lingam which is presented in the form of a parable.
