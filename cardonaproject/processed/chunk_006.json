The same problems occupied the minds\nof the ancients themselves—definitely the ancient Greeks who were very “concerned with\nthe relation of rationalism to traditional beliefs.” As Fred Bratton noted:\n\n“The Sophists and Neoplatonists anticipated one modern solution by defining myths\nas allegories that symbolized moral or spiritual truth and were not to be taken liter-\nally. The Neoplatonic and Stoic philosophers of the Hellenistic period were thus able\nto hold both to tradition and rationalism. This method of interpretation was rejected\nby Plato and the later Epicureans as just a way of keeping intact the traditional super-\nnatural beliefs of the state religion and keeping the facts of history from the people.\nThe emperor Julian regarded myths as esoteric teachings understood only by the intel-\nlectual aristocracy. The early Christian theologians discredited the pagan myths while\nteaching new ones for the Hebrew and Christian religions.”\n\nOther than as a form of art, often more of a voluptuous or heroic nature than not, mythol-\nogy is not much valued by the modern layman. Yet, in one form or another—and this in-\ncludes past and recent occultism among our youth—religion is. Here lies one of the major in-\ncongruities of the problem I wish to address because, in essence, religion is only the philo-\nsophical interpretation and mystic ritualization of myth.\n\nThe forms which man’s various religions have taken in the past, and continue to take in\nthe present, are endless. The names of his past and present gods are legion. The rituals he has\ninvented with which he has sought, and continues to seek, divine protection and godly bless-\ning have run the gamut from love feasts to horrible mass human sacrifice. Throughout the\nages, the expositional interpretation and theological apologetics concerning his rites and be-\nliefs have filled untold volumes most of which do nothing but contradict each other.\n\nMeanwhile, the discoveries of anthropology and archaeology keep adding evidence not\nonly of the antiquity of man’s basic faith but also of the universality of its thematic structure.\nEven that indomitable primitive, Neanderthal Man, it finally had to be admitted, had, burning\nin his savage breast, the desperate need to satisfy, or otherwise appease, the unseen forces.\n\nH.

                    "content": "moment of his human inception.\n\nThe study of comparative religion, despite its past overall banality, has always been sub-\nject to stray insights. From the very beginning of the development of western thought, the\nphilosophers have been cognizant of the universality of certain religious rites and beliefs.\nAmong these one can enumerate all manner of lustrative rituals; the need for some sort of re-\ndemption; the immortality of the soul, the mind, or the human aura; the belief in paradise,\nhell, or some other place of existence after death; and various others.\n\nMost of these have often been explained as a psychological alleviation—a ray of hope\nagainst the realization of a futile life capped with the finality of death. Man, it has been said\nbefore, is the only animal burdened with this acute awareness. It is also for this same reason\nthat those of an unreligious bent of mind, whether they realize it or not, very often find them-\nselves involved in a continuous search for the supposed meaning of life.\n\nBelief in an afterlife should not, of itself, incur a belief in God. Belief in a reward, or\npunishment, after death, on the other hand, does—for someone, or something, must exist to\njudge and mete out justice. This someone, this something, this God, should logically be ex-\nemplary. How come most of man’s gods are not?\n\nThe philosophic endeavor to discern moral precepts in divine action becomes something\nof a farce when one is confronted with the ungodly activities of most deities. The Greek\ngods, for instance, were guilty of patricide, butchery, cannibalism, rage, jealousy, adultery,\nrape, incest, deception, and slaughter without equal. These actions are not symbolic of moral\nprecepts; they are the irresponsible adventures of a bunch of delinquent revelers. Why, then,\ndid the Greeks look up to these imperfect gods, build them costly temples, offer them\nsacrifices, prayers, and invocations, while philosophers endeavored to illustrate the divinity\nof what they believed to be the orderly universe by comparing it with these gods?\n\nThe Stoics and pagan apologists had long attempted to spiritualize the myths described by\nHesiod and others. This spiritualization, in the form of allegorism, continued as the dominant\nmode of mythic interpretation well past the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance. Only\nhalfway through the seventeenth century, and more so during the eighteenth, did philoso-\nphers begin to reduce the fantastic episodes of classical mythology to common-sense narra-\ntives. But this was merely an attempt to de-allegorize the myths. The origin of the gods, to-\ngether with the rites connected with them, remained unexplained.\n\nThe actions of the Greek gods could no longer be seen as the moral conflict between good\nand evil—between virtue and vice—for the simple reason that, according to the myths, the\nevil, or vice, was more often triumphant than not. Zeus was guilty of more deceptions and\nrapes than any other god the Greeks venerated. Yet this same Zeus was considered to be the\nupholder of law and order. If this divine lawlessness could not be explained allegorically, it\ncould only mean that the gods were impervious to their own laws.\n\nPierre Bayle took great pleasure in accumulating tales which told of the lusts of these\ngods and goddesses who could indulge in incestuous and homosexual rape. To him, the\nGreek world was a world of sex-mad divinities. Yet the Greeks of ancient times believed\nthat these actions, normally repugnant even to them despite their hedonistic society, actually\ntook place precisely as narrated by the early poets—by Hesiod, by Homer, and others.\n\n47, pp. 96 ff.\n\nSee here, for instance, the melding of Greek myths by way of allegory with Christian beliefs during the\nRenaissance, as outlined by M.

Ouranos’\nchildren, born of Gaea, planned a revolt against their father. Ouranos therefore imprisoned\nthese rebellious sons. In revenge, Gaea inflamed her youngest-born, Kronos, to overthrow his\nfather. Kronos, hiding in ambush, attacked his father and castrated him with a sickle. He then\nbecame lord of heaven in his father’s stead.\n\nFearing a similar rebellion, Kronos did not see fit to release his brethren. Worse than that,\nlaying in incest with his sister Rhea, he commenced to devour his own offspring. But when\nhis son Zeus was born, Rhea gave Kronos a stone to swallow in his stead. When Zeus grew\nto manhood, he also attacked his father and deposed him. Like Ouranos and Kronos before\nhim, Zeus then inherited the lordship of heaven.\n\nWhat philosophical insights could lay buried within this tale of incest, revenge, castra-\ntion, patricide, cannibalism, stupidity (for how could a god have mistaken a stone for his in-\nfant child?), and deception?\n\nNot that philosophers have not tried. Pierre Jurieu, for instance, saw Kronos as a symbol\nof time which devours what it first produces. Jurieu’s belief derived from the fact that, in\nGreek, “Time” is rendered Chronos, which concept they then attributed to Kronos. Jurieu did\nnot ask what prompted the Greeks to equate time with their god Kronos—and this question\nshould have been asked in view of the fact that Kronos was also the Greek name of the planet\nwe call Saturn.\n\nTo the ancient Greeks, the planet Saturn would have appeared as nothing more than a pin-\npoint of light in the night sky, no different than the way it appears to us with the unaided eye\nat present. What, then, could have impelled the Greeks to equate this pin-point of light with\nthe abstract idea of time?\n\nWhen, as narrated in the above myth, Zeus deposed Kronos, did he also depose time?\nBetter still, what does it mean that Zeus deposed Kronos?—for Zeus was also the Greek\nname of a planet, that which today is known to us as Jupiter. What could it mean that the\nplanet Jupiter deposed the planet Saturn?\n\nDespite what philosophers, mythologists, and students of ancient religion might have\nwritten in the past, the tale recorded above can have no philosophical meaning—at least none\nthat would not be strained.
