                    "content": "Many believe that what happens is unsettling. Both orbit and magnetic field indeed change. We will not concern ourselves here with the change in Earth’s magnetic field, nor will we concern ourselves much with what led to this discovery beyond the shortest of synopses. The bottom line is the conclusion reached by geologist Madeline Briskin in her investigation of seafloor core samples. Sediment has always been deemed a reliable indicator of past climatic conditions. What Briskin discovered through the age and molecular design of the ocean fossils embedded in the sediments she studied led her to conclude that Earth’s climate follows a repetitive cycle of changes of approximately 413,000 years duration. This cycle, according to her, is brought about by Earth’s changing orbit as it moves closer to, then farther away from, the Sun. As far as the present work is concerned, no judgment will be passed on the possible validity or otherwise of this deduction. We merely note it as one indication of various theories from the establishment in which changes in Earth’s orbit are deduced from certain evidences and made to account for certain past situations. Are any of these scenarios any wilder than one which posits Earth to be an escaped satellite of Saturn? Ah yes—but the above events, whether they transpired or not, have all been dated to millions of years ago as opposed to the scenario being presented here which claims Earth to have still been a satellite of Saturn during the advent of man. This is an objection we will be running into time and again. In 1986, Lynn Rose, who, with Raymond Vaughan, had been working on the Babylonian Ninsianna tablets, surprised Velikovsky’s followers by correcting their earlier conclusion, and that of Velikovsky himself, concerning the not-so-ancient orbit of the planet Venus. In 1950, Velikovsky had been of the opinion that the astronomical observations contained in these tablets—sometimes referred to as the Tablets of Ammizaduqa, sometimes simply as the Venus tablets—showed beyond a reasonable doubt that Venus had been moving on an entirely different orbit at the time the observations were conducted. Originally concurring with him, Rose and Vaughan eventually came to an entirely different conclusion. Like many others, including Velikovsky, we at one time took it for granted that the Venus tablets would tell us about a radically different orbit of Venus. We have gradually come to realize, however, that at the time of the observations Venus might have been on or close to its present orbit. The strangeness of these eighth-century B.C. observations of Venus seems to be mainly due to their having been made from an Earth that was on a radically different orbit from the present orbit of Earth. In 1993, Michael Reade came to similar conclusions, although the amount in Earth’s orbital expansion as given by him—from a posited 0.9904 AU to the present 1.000 AU—would not lend itself to being called radical, representing a mere 0.97% to 1% expansion.",

                    "content": "Once again, I shall not comment here on the validity, or otherwise, of these deductions. I merely mention them as the possible—even probable—fallout of a set of Babylonian astronomical observations. On the other hand, I shall have more to say about this particular datum in a future work which will deal with the attainment of Earth’s present orbital path. The habitable zone raises an entirely different problem that our hypothesis concerns. It has been pointed out that, were it not for the insulation provided by its atmosphere, Earth’s temperature would fall well below the freezing point of water, similar to that of the Moon. And that would be at Earth’s present distance from the Sun. What, then, would Earth’s temperature have been at Saturn’s present distance from the Sun—insulating atmosphere or not? This is most important because, needless to say, Earth’s temperature has a direct bearing on the sustenance of life. The existence of life on Earth is manifestly due to our planet’s distance from the Sun—it just happens to be positioned in the Sun’s habitable zone—which is the reason why it is the only planet in the Solar System capable of sustaining life. Earth is at 1 AU from the Sun (approximately 93 million miles). Saturn is at 9.5 AU from the Sun (approximately 886.3 million miles). As a satellite of Saturn, would not Earth have been in the “freeze zone”? How, then, could it have sustained life, including that of man? What, exactly, is the extent of the Sun’s habitable zone? At one time the habitable zone was believed to stretch between 0.7 and 1.3 AU. In 1977, however, Michael Hart reduced this zone to the narrow range extending from 0.95 to 1.01 AU. This would still have meant that had Earth been 5% closer to the Sun, its oceans would evaporate; had it been only 1% further away, total glaciation would put an end to life. But then, in 1988, the scientists at NASA’s Ames Centre found reason to increase the distance of the habitable zone by 50%. Life, however, requires more than the right amount of heat and sunlight. It also requires water, of which Earth has an abundance. But here’s the rub. Long-range exploration of the planets has convinced astronomers that Venus and Mars also once possessed abundant water. In the case of Venus, its water is said to have evaporated into space because of its closer proximity to the Sun. This mechanism, however, does not work for Mars, which is farther from the Sun than Earth. An entirely different process had therefore to be worked out for the red planet. As James Kasting wrote: “Mars is freeze-dried today, not because it is too far from the sun but because it is a small planet and therefore cooled off comparatively quickly.” All this has led to the belief that the habitable zone, which has now been revised to range from just inside the orbit of Earth to beyond the orbit of Mars, has “migrated slowly outward from its position when the planets first formed...about 4.6 billion years ago, because the sun has gradually brightened over time.",

It is not that I, personally, adhere to the above scenario—and, in a future work, I hope to have much to say concerning the past histories of Venus and Mars—but it does show that, when the facts seem to demand it, astronomers are not exactly nervous about shifting planets and their habitable zones, to say nothing of varying the Sun’s radiative output, in order to fit their theories. But, the reader may complain, is it at all possible to shift this habitable zone all the way out to Saturn? Maybe not, but, theoretically at least, could we not perhaps shift Saturn into the habitable zone? Actually, back in 1982, Ragnar Forshufvud theorized just that, moving a Saturn that had once been much larger to much closer to the Sun. But I only present this datum as an interesting exercise because, judging by what can be deduced from the mytho-historical record, the truth may have been exactly the opposite. Be that as it may, it is not really necessary to move a celestial body into the so-called habitable zone, or even closer to the Sun, in order to have it appropriately heated. Io, one of Jupiter’s satellites, is said to be heated through Jupiter’s tidal pull. Then why not Earth as a satellite of Saturn? And even then, do we really need Saturn’s tidal pull in order to heat Earth? Have we not already seen that Saturn radiates more heat than it actually receives from the Sun? Can this excessive heat be seen as the residue from a time when Saturn was much hotter? Have we not, on the strength of the mytho-historical record, posited that Saturn had once been a miniature sun radiating its own heat and light? True enough, Saturn could never have been as hot as the Sun. The proximity of Earth to Saturn, however, would have more than compensated for this.",

                    "content": "Chapter 8 The Solitary Deity THE ONE ALONE. In an article written in 1977, Harold Tresman and Bernard Newgrosh (writing under the name of Brendan O’Gheoghan) presented what might have been their finest disclosure when they wrote that there is every indication that this original deity [that is Saturn] was at one time the only visible planetary body of the heavens. Roger Wescott, based on his own research, came to the same conclusion: The sky, instead of being dominated alternately by the Sun and the Moon, was constantly dominated by a single, huge, luminous body, here called Aster. What Wescott referred to as Aster is to us the planet Saturn. If this had really been the case—in other words, if Saturn had been the only celestial body visible from Earth during the indeterminate time with which we are concerned—it would add even more to the ancient belief that Saturn had been the most prominent heavenly body that could be seen in Earth’s primordial sky. Think about it: We have seen that Earth had been a satellite of what is now the planet Saturn, which planet was described as having been near enough to Earth to be remembered as a sphere, which sphere, in turn, was described as a sun that shone at night when no other heavenly body could be seen. What could have been more prominent? But does the mytho-historical record uphold the view that Saturn was the only visible body during the time in question? David Talbott has long focused attention on this topic. As he stated: The Egyptians remembered the creator as the solitary Atum or Ra, whom we recognize as the planet Saturn. In the accounts of all periods, Ra is originally a solitary god. The ancient sun is he...who had no companions. “I am Atum, when I was alone in Nun,” the god is made to state. The deity is thus called the God One, the “Only God”—“except whom at the beginning none other existed.” Time and again, in Egyptian liturgies, we hear of Atum being made to state, “when I was alone.” Time and again, Atum is lauded as he who “was alone.” Thus the god, in his earliest remembered state, as Talbott has noted, is inactive and motionless—doing nothing, lacking activity or animation.",

Ptah’s self-generation is again alluded to in no uncertain terms in another hymn in which he is lauded with the following words: “Thou hadst no father to begat thee...and thou hadst no mother to give birth unto thee; thou didst fashion thyself without the help of any other being.

Presented as the son of Raven, it is Raven Boy who is painted as the mischievous trickster. In keeping with our present topic, note now the Haida creed as paraphrased by Helmut Hirnschall: \"No one is exempt from loneliness, and the old and wise ones who teach the ways of living and tell stories at campfires say that even Raven, the Creator, knew the burden of loneliness.\" In order to have known “the burden of loneliness,” Raven had to have been alone—that is, the only deity in existence. Through the rules of comparative mythology, it will have to be assumed that, in this instance, it is Raven/Saturn that is meant and not Raven Boy/Mars. Here we should also mention the Yuki creator whose name, Taiké-mol, translates as “Solitude Walker.” There is no need to explain that a solitude walker walks alone, and in this Yuki myth, we are merely catching a glimpse of Raven in a different guise. According to the Samoans, their creator, Tangaloa, who lived in the far spaces, was alone before there was heaven and earth. Similarly, in a myth from New Hebrides, it is said that the creator, Naareau the Elder, “was the First of All.” Nothing was before him: He was in the void, there was only Naareau sitting in the void.

Some have claimed that man’s own ancestors, long dead, perhaps through the medium of dreams, were also vivified into ghosts, or lost souls, which were eventually incorporated into an ever-evolving religious belief. Others insist that the ancient deities evolved out of respect for certain historical persons of note—an idea recently revived by David Rohl in his sensational attempt to rewrite ancient history. Those who hold to this view usually point to the Mesopotamian Gilgamesh, a supposed king of Uruk, and the Egyptian Imhotep, architect to King Djoser, as prime examples of their evidence. Gilgamesh, however, has finally been established as anything but a historical person, while the case of Imhotep is somewhat unique. The first builder of a pyramid—a stepped one to be sure—later dynasts were so impressed by Imhotep’s accomplishments that he was elevated to the stature of a god. The belief that the ancient gods were really deified historical persons, never adhered to by many, is now accepted by even less. On the contrary, the reverse is true, in that some of the primeval deities were eventually demythologized and presented in human form even by the ancients themselves. Our own hypothesis, as presented in this work, holds that the concept of deity owes its origin to the planets, especially the planet Saturn, and not to such invented spirits, ghosts, demons, or historical persons as described above. I am not here asserting that the mysteries of everyday life, as they pertained to our primitive forebears, were not conducive to the myth-making process. But to say that our ancestors were more concerned with the threatening character of everyday life, such as flood, famine, earthquakes, and the like, is to go against what they themselves told us concerning their beliefs. If the truth be known, even such calamities were often connected with the planetary deities, and they were so connected by the ancients themselves. Among the Incas, Saturn was considered the god of famine. Almost throughout the entire world, Mars was considered the god of pestilence. Venus was associated with fear, darkness, and death.
