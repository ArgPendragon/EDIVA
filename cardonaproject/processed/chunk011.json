                    "content": "The manuscript lists 405 synodic months over approximately 33 years of observation. It also presents a table of 69 possible dates for future solar eclipses. The Evening Star, Venus, with its irregular course, was the first to appear and the last to fade, capturing their attention. The Maya strived to measure its height, which varies at sunrise and sunset. All of these preoccupations, which extended beyond those required to compile an agrarian calendar, reflect their obsessive interest in infinity—whether of time or space—and also an anxiety in the face of the passage of time. \n\nThe astronomical observations of the Maya were so precise that the figures they arrived at in computing the solar year were not only more accurate than the Julian year, but, as some have claimed, also more accurate than the Gregorian year introduced into Europe in 1582 and still in use today. Mesoamerican calendars were not produced by any single individual in one generation. Their development and refinement was the product of centuries. In fact, their basic components can be traced back to the Olmec, who established cities and ceremonial centers on Mexico's Gulf Coast at least as early as the second century B.C. In time, these calendars evolved into an intricate system in which several different time cycles, all calculated independently and with similar exactitude, were incorporated in various combinations for the purpose of time measurement.\n\nOne notable calendar employed by the Maya, called Haab, was based on a 360-day count, divided into 18 months of 20 days each, with five additional days—believed to be malefic, ill-omened, empty, and nameless—added at the end to total 365 days. Although the 365-day calendar, which eventually became common to all Mesoamerican peoples, is attested in inscriptions as early as 667 B.C., Edmonson notes that the 360-day calendar did not come into use among the Olmecs until the first century B.C., approximately 300 years after the introduction of the 365-day calendar. I mention this because if Edmonson is correct, Velikovsky's contention that the 365-day calendar followed the 360-day one must be incorrect.\n\nA simpler, but more enigmatic, calendar known as Tzolkin by the Maya and Tonalamatl by the Aztecs, consisted of 260 days divided into 13 months of 20 days each. This sacred calendar was used to align religious festivals with the proper seasons; however, it has been downplayed by some scholars of Mesoamerican culture. Recently, Vincent Malmström has proposed that this 260-day calendar is even older than the Maya, suggesting it was originally developed for agricultural purposes by the Zoque of Mexico's Pacific coastal plain, marking the interval between solar zenith passages.",

                    "content": "The Zoque's ceremonial center at Izapa developed in the fourteenth century B.C., passed to the Olmecs of the Gulf Coast, then to the Maya in the east and the plateau of Mexico in the west. Whether Malmström has uncovered a red herring, and whether Mayanists will accept his conclusions, remains to be seen. One certitude is that the synchronization of this calendar with the 360-day one occurred every 18,980 days, or 52 years. This period also coincides with the ceremony known as the Binding of the Years, which began at the midnight transit of the Pleiades constellation.\n\nThe Mesoamericans devised a lunar calendar that integrated with their timekeeping devices. The lunar period of 29.53 days they calculated contained a minor discrepancy of only 0.112 of a day. \n\nThe Dresden Codex not only features the perpetual lunar calendar referenced above but also includes a table of new moons for predicting solar eclipses. \n\nVENUS\nOf all the celestial bodies observed by the Mesoamericans, Venus was undoubtedly of paramount importance. Often referred to as the Great or Ancient Star, it is frequently alluded to in extant codices. Ramén y Zamora, a scholar of Mexican tribal lore shortly after the rediscovery of America, expressed astonishment at the precision with which the natives recorded the planet's appearances. He noted that they maintained accurate records of the days on which it appeared and disappeared, asserting, \"So accurately did they keep the record of the days when it appeared and disappeared that they never made a mistake.\" Toribo Motolina noted further that they knew the precise day it would appear again in the east after disappearing in the west, counting the days by this star and offering reverence and sacrifices to it.\n\nThe Dresden Codex includes a complete record of Venus's apparitions in its cycle from Morning to Evening Star, recorded using dot and bar mathematical symbols—where a dot signifies 1 and a bar signifies 5, with oval shapes representing the concept of zero. They recorded the time elapsed between successive heliacal risings, calculated to be 584 days, which they subdivided into four intervals: Morning Star appearance, Evening Star appearance, disappearance in front of the Sun, and disappearance behind the Sun.\n\nVenus completes a circuit around the Sun in 224.7 days. However, as observed from Earth, it appears to take 583.92 days to do so because Earth is also moving in the same direction. This apparent time-span is known as the synodic period. The Mesoamericans calculated the Venerian synodic year as 584 days, which, when compared to modern measurements of 583.92 days, reveals an error of less than one hour.",

They knew that eight vague years were equivalent to five Venus “years.” Thus, the cumulative period of days amounting to 2,920 arises repeatedly in their Venus tables. They had accurately calculated that Venus returns to nearly the exact same spot in the sky at almost the same time of the year every 2,920 days. \n\nMeanwhile, a relatively recent manuscript dubbed the Grolier Codex surfaced in 1971. According to Michael Coe, like the Dresden Codex, the extant eleven pages of this manuscript illustrate the Venus calendar but display a much more sophisticated system, described as \"the world’s first and only perpetual calendar of Venus ever produced by any civilization.\" Charles Lacombe asserts, \"This ancient Mayan document must rank among the supreme intellectual achievements of humanity.\" It predicts the appearances and disappearances of Venus in a grand cycle of 845 revolutions equal to 1,352 years; upon completion, the cycle repeats endlessly by altering the order of the lines and their reading.",

By the tenth century, similar records from Korea became available. \n\nIt should be noted, however, that while detecting sunspots does not require much expertise since they can be seen with the unaided eye, it is often overlooked that viewing the Sun directly without protection is not safe, except during sunrise and sunset. It is possible that the Chinese utilized dark or smoked glass for protection when observing the Sun. Yet even smoked glass can be inadequate. Sunspots can also be observed indirectly through haze or thin clouds. As John Gribbin pointed out, records mentioning sunspots often note that the brightness of the Sun was reduced, not implying that the Sun itself was dim but rather that dust or haze obscured its light. Echoing this understanding, it is remarkable that it took until the early seventeenth century in Europe for sunspots to be rediscovered, with Galileo's insistence on their presence leading to his persecution by the Catholic Church.",

These records documented the brief but notable appearances of stars that usually remain invisible until such explosions occur. Perhaps the most famous example of a \"Guest Star\" in Chinese history is the supernova event of 1054 A.D., believed to have created the Crab Nebula. \n\nTHE SURYA SIDDHANTA\nAs for Hindu astronomical knowledge, I will mention only notable aspects of the *Surya Siddhanta*, which presents the accurate understanding that Earth is spherical.

Importantly, a significant portion of his theories were original contributions rooted in his own observations and extensive numerical calculations underpinning the tables within the *Almagest*.\n\nSome modern defenders of Ptolemy argue that his systems are often misunderstood by both astronomers and historians. Wolfe noted that Ptolemy did not intend his theory to serve as a precise representation of the sky; it was a method for calculating planetary positions rather than a depiction of the Solar System. Much like Copernicus's theory, initially presented as a mathematical construct, Ptolemy's system was mistakenly elevated to absolute truth by later generations.",
