                    "content": "The structure was constructed within the sacred precinct of the god. What should also be noted here is that the rites of Dionysus so closely resembled those of the Egyptian god Osiris that Herodotus thought it impossible for the Greek rites to have risen independently of the Egyptian ones. Therefore, he supposed that the Greeks must have borrowed their rites from the Egyptians and, with slight alterations, passed them on as their own. So, incidentally, did Plutarch, who insisted upon the detailed resemblances between the rites of Osiris and those of Dionysus, which, if nothing else, indicates that comparative mythology is not merely a modern tool that some of its critics maintain. In this instance, as in many others, however, no borrowing need be called for. What is at bottom here is that whatever Dionysus originally stood for was the very same thing that the Egyptian Osiris had originally represented. Put simply, Osiris and Dionysus were representations of the same original phenomenon; they were, in essence, one and the same god under different national guises. Others, of course, have maintained that the similarity of Greek rituals to those of the Egyptians stems from the ignorance of the Greeks regarding Egyptian practices. For instance, Gwyn Griffiths tried to convince his readers that Greek observers were “not usually in a position” to understand Egyptian religion, particularly because of their ignorance of the Egyptian language. According to Griffiths, Greek theological explanations of Egyptian religious particulars and mythological equations were based on misunderstandings regarding Dionysus.",

But, as Martin Bernal pointed out, these assertions concerning the Afroasiatic roots of Classical Greek culture are worth discussing. Despite critique from mainstream scholars, Bernal argued convincingly that many ancient Egyptian cultural aspects are often oversimplified, ignoring the depth of understanding of figures like Eudoxos, who lived closely with the priests and exhibited great respect for Egyptian culture. Notably, the term tragedy in Greek, tragodia, means “goat song,” derived from tragos, the sacred animal of Dionysus. This etymology suggests a clear connection to the reverence of Dionysus, as the goat song itself was sung in honor of the god, depicting his birth and violent end. The tragic connotation of “goat song” became understood as a synonym for misfortune.",

When history is transmitted through a succession of professional bards with highly trained memories, it is likely to remain accurate even when put into writing centuries later. Alfred de Grazia noted that an exact rendition of a large body of verse and prose can be transmitted over generations. This technique resembles how nursery rhymes learned by rote can be recalled with precision years later. Parry suggested that Homeric hexameters were shaped by earlier oral traditions and likely aided the preservation of the epics through formulas shaped to fit particular line structures. This indicates that the oral tradition played a crucial role in the transmission of cultural narratives, with evidence of significant historical accuracy.",
