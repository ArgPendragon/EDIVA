                    "content": "All his own observations are fraudulent, so far as we can test them. Many of the observations that he attributes to other astronomers are also fraud that he has committed. His work is riddled with theoretical errors and with failures of comprehension. His models of the Moon and Mercury conflict violently with elementary observation and must be counted as failures. The worst of Ptolemy’s failures, however, was his geocentric system, which eventually became known as the Ptolemaic system. Despite Owen Gingerich’s claim that the geocentric world view was almost universally accepted in his day, when Ptolemy presented Earth as the center of the universe with the planets revolving around it, he was rejecting what had already been deduced before his time. Having considered the heliocentric system advocated by his forebears, he disqualified it since the implied violent rotation of Earth, as deduced from Aristotle’s physics, seemed to Ptolemy to be contrary to observation. He reasoned that Earth’s rotation would have left the animals and other weights hanging in the air; Earth itself, he thought, would very quickly fall out of the heavens. As he stated, merely to conceive such things makes them appear ridiculous. As Carl Sagan correctly noted, in rejecting the earlier belief that the planets revolved around the Sun, Ptolemy was responsible for preventing the advance of astronomy for a millennium. Thus, Robert Newton may not have been too harsh in his judgment when he claimed that Ptolemy caused us to lose much of the genuine work in Greek astronomy and that it would have been better for astronomy had the Almagest never been written. What, then, was this ancient Greek astronomy that Ptolemy sought to supersede? How superior was it to that espoused by Ptolemy? THE HELIOCENTRIC SYSTEM Many authorities on the subject of ancient Greek astronomy have in years past stressed the primitive nature of their knowledge. Many of them have relied on the oft-repeated dictum that the world according to Homer consisted of a round, but flat, Earth overarched by a semi-spherical sky in which the gods had fashioned their various domains. But even as early as 1881, Simon Newcomb had already warned against this erroneous belief. As he wrote, \"Not enough credit has been given to the ancient astronomers. For instance, there was no time within the scope of history when it was not known that the Earth is a sphere and that the direction down at different points is toward the same point at the Earth’s center. Current teaching in the textbooks as to the knowledge of astronomy by the ancients is at fault.\" The discovery that the Sun, rather than Earth, was the body at the center of the Solar System has for long been attributed to the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Koppernigk, popularly known as Copernicus (1473-1543). It is sometimes forgotten that the Greek astronomer, Claudius Ptolemy, had previously presented a geocentric model, with the Earth at the center of the universe.",

For that reason, Heuer thought it appropriate to call Aristarchus “the ancient Copernicus.” Personally, giving credit where it is really due, I would rather turn that around by calling Copernicus “the modern Aristarchus.” Copernicus himself was not only aware that Aristarchus had preceded him in the discovery; he actually admitted to the fact in a passage of his work. Wishing to retain the fame for himself, however, he had second thoughts and ended up by excising all mention of Aristarchus in his published version. To be sure, the work in which Aristarchus proposed this hypothesis has not survived, but the hypothesis itself was well-known and commented upon by other writers. For instance, in the Reckoner, Aristarchus stated, \"But Aristarchus of Samos brought out a book consisting of some hypotheses, in which the premises lead to the result that the universe is many times greater than that now called. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, and that the Earth revolves about the Sun in the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit.\" Granted that the great Plato (427-348 B.C.) had himself placed Earth in the center of the universe, it seems as if even he had a change of mind. According to Plutarch (A.D. 46-120), Theophrastus had it stated that, when he had grown old, Plato repented, “that he had placed the Earth in the middle of the universe, which was not its place.” Actually, the belief in a heliocentric system seems to have originated not even with Aristarchus, but with Herakleides Ponticus (Heracleides of Pontus) who died in 322 B.C. We do not know when he was born. The same idea was also advanced much later by Macrobius (A.D. 395-423) and Martianus Capella (circa A.D. 400) and maintained by Emperor Julian the Apostate (A.D 332-363) and Nicolaus Cusanus (Nicholas of Cusa—A.D. 1401-1464) who himself based his opinions on those of Iamblichus of Chalcis, all of whom wrote long before Copernicus abrogated the idea.",

Copernicus, of course, was not the only astronomer of later times who appropriated the works of the ancients. The Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) also announced as his own discovery the fact that Venus and Mercury revolved around the Sun, despite the fact that Heracleides of Pontus had already made the discovery. It might now be objected that these ancient discoveries were not universally adhered to. Thus, for instance, Plutarch, who was anything but an astronomer, immortalized his conviction that Earth does not move. In other words, borrowing a phrase from the indomitable Charles Fort, there was not agreement among the wise men. The study of ancient Greek astronomy also makes it obvious that while an investigator might, through observation and calculation, come to a correct conclusion about a celestial object, the very same person would often hold an incorrect belief concerning another. But was this any different than what transpired later in the so-called age of enlightenment? As Velikovsky noted, during his lifetime, Copernicus had only one follower, Rheticus, and was rejected by all others. Kepler’s discoveries were rejected by Galileo, his peer; Newton’s gravitational theory was rejected by Leibniz, his peer; and Agassiz, who was ridiculed, rejected Darwin. Virchow did not support Pasteur; Edison rejected and fought against Tesla and the use of alternating current. The list can be multiplied a hundred times. It goes back to Archimedes’ rejection of Aristarchus, who taught that the Earth revolves around the Sun. In fact, was it any different than what continues to transpire down to the present day? When new astronomical, or other scientific, discoveries come to light, as they continue to do almost day by day, and theories are then formulated to account for the discoveries, can it be said that astronomers and/or other scientists are almost immediately of one mind concerning them?",

He accomplished this when he was told that at Syene, the present Aswan, in Egypt, there was a well that, at noon on the day of the summer solstice, was illuminated by the Sun down to the bottom. He also knew that, on the same day at Alexandria, a vertical staff cast a short shadow. From this—a shadow in one place but no shadow in another on the same day—Eratosthenes first verified that Earth was indeed spherical. Then, knowing the distance between Syene and Alexandria, which was measured at 5,000 stadia, and using some simple geometry, he realized that this was 7°, or close to 1/50 of a great circle. He thus arrived at the figure of 250,000 stadia, which he subsequently corrected to 252,000 stadia, as the circumference of Earth. When translated into miles or kilometers, his result was only a few percent off the mark. It was upon discovering the vastness of the world he lived on that Eratosthenes became convinced of the immensity of the universe. The Greeks were also aware that Earth’s axis was inclined, and that it was inclined toward the south. As Plutarch wrote, “Diogenes and Anaxagoras affirm that, after the world was composed and the Earth had produced living creatures, the world out of its own propensity made an inclination toward the south.” Unfortunately, Plutarch, bless his soul, was not only not an astronomer, he was not much of a geographer either. So he did make something of a mess when it came to explaining the reasons behind Earth’s inclination and, especially, when he attempted to account for its effects.",

He realized that the equinoctial points—those points at which the Sun’s path crosses the equator—had moved westward along the ecliptic. He estimated this movement at about a degree per century, or 36 seconds per year. The true value, of course, is closer to 50 seconds, but considering the crude equipment he had to work with, it is evident that he did extremely well. It has, however, been argued that Hipparchus could not have discovered this fact based on Timocharis’ observations alone, since these observations did not go back far enough in time for anyone to have noticed the difference in the positions of the stars as brought about by the slow motion of precession. It is more probable that Hipparchus had access to older Babylonian observations, as the Babylonians had first started to measure longitudes by referring stars to the ecliptic.",

This is not to say that others have not vied for the fame—even if in retrospect and through modern proxy. None of these attempts have, however, withstood the test of scrutiny. THE CRIME OF ANAXAGORAS Anaxagoras was the first to clearly state that the Moon shines with the reflected light from the Sun, from which he devised a theory concerning the phases of the Moon. At the time, as with Galileo much later, this doctrine, which was not in keeping with the prejudices of the day, was so dangerous that the manuscript in which Anaxagoras set out these theories had to be circulated in secrecy. A century later, Aristotle, a great mind in some matters, was to argue that the Moon exhibited phases and that eclipses occurred simply because that was the nature of Earth’s satellite—which was, as Sagan succinctly put it, an explanation that explains nothing. Anaxagoras also believed that the Sun and the stars were hot. While this was evident for the Sun, it was not, as it still is not, for the stars. When asked why we do not feel the heat of the stars, he replied correctly that it was because they were too far away. When he calculated the Sun to be larger than the Peloponnesus, which constitutes about a third of Greece, his estimate was thought to be excessive and absurd. He knew that the Moon harbored mountains, although he also believed it harbored life. In the end, again much like Galileo, Anaxagoras was charged, convicted, and imprisoned for impiety, mainly because he had taught that the Moon consisted of ordinary, and not divine, matter. It took Pericles, the great Athenian leader, to engineer Anaxagoras’ release from prison.",

THE ROTATION AND REVOLUTION OF PLANETS That the planets both rotated on their own axes and moved on their orbits was well known to Plato. Thus he wrote that the Creator gave to each heavenly body two movements: the first, a movement on the same spot after the same manner; the second a forward movement. Nor was Plato the only one. As Lynn Rose wrote: The Sicilian Pythagoreans, Hiketas and Ekphantos, both of whom were from Syracuse, spoke explicitly of Earth’s rotation in situ. The cosmology of Herakleides of Pontus featured the same basic device. PLANETARY CONJUNCTIONS Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), famous for his discovery of the three laws of planetary motions, wrote of a “great conjunction” that took place between the planets Jupiter and Saturn every 20 years, culminating in a “mighty conjunction” every 60 years. Kepler prepared diagrams illuminating these conjunctions as they occurred against the background of the zodiac. As E. S. Kennedy has shown, however, Arabian astrology already knew all that. Earlier still, the Neoplatonist Olympiodorus (6th century A.D.) knew, and wrote, that one revolution of Jupiter took twelve years and that of Saturn was accomplished in thirty years. For if the sphere of Jupiter comes from the same to the same in twelve years, but that of Saturn in thirty years, it is evident that when Jupiter has made five, Saturn will have made two revolutions: for twice thirty is sixty, and so likewise is twelve times five; so that their revolutions will be conjoined in sixty years. THE PERIODICITY OF COMETS It has often been stated that ancient historical documents, to say nothing of mythological ones, have nothing to offer as far as modern astronomy is concerned. But, as Livio Stecchini pointed out, this is certainly not true when it comes to the periodicity of comets. No science of comets is possible without the use of these records.",
