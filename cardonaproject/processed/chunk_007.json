                    "content": "That ancient man worshipped the planets as gods is not a new revelation. The study of classical texts, cuneiform tablets, and even the pages of the Old Testament have long illuminated this oft-ignored aspect of ancient religions. The Sun and the Moon—one as the benefactor of light and warmth, the other as the vanquisher of nightly shades—might be considered appropriate candidates for divine worship. But what influence could the planets have exerted on Earth and its inhabitants to induce our ancient forebears to deify them, venerate them, and offer them the blood of human sacrifice? After all, unlike the Sun and Moon, to the unaided eye, the planets appear no more than small flickering pinpoints of light lost amid a starry sea among a multitude of other flickering pinpoints of light.\n\nThe ancient Greeks deified all of the heavenly bodies of the Solar System that were, and still are, visible to the naked eye. Saturn was Kronos, who was once king of heaven. Jupiter was Zeus, who, as in the case of other planetary pantheons, seized the kingdom of the gods from his father, Kronos/Saturn. Mars was known as Ares, the blood-thirsty god of war. Aphrodite, the goddess of love, perhaps the most popular of the Greek deities, was the personification of Venus. The planet Mercury was Hermes, with his winged sandals, the swiftest god among the Olympians.\n\nThese planetary identifications were even adopted by those ancient peoples who came into direct contact with the Greeks. Thus, in The Book of the Secrets of Enoch, a Graeco-Jewish work from the intertestamental period, the names of the planets are given in Greek: Kruno for Kronos/Saturn; Zeus for Jupiter; Aris for Ares/Mars; Aphrodit for Aphrodite/Venus; and Ermis for Hermes/Mercury.\n\nCan it, however, be said that in the minds of the Greeks, planets and gods were synonymous? I pose this all-important question because critics have often denied this to have been the case. My answer is that the identity of the ancient gods as planets should never have been questioned. The only acceptable assertion in this matter is that of those very people who once believed in and venerated these gods. Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend recognized this truth when they wrote:\n\n“The most ‘ancient treasure’ ... left to us by our predecessors ... was the idea that the gods are really stars, and that there are no others. The forces reside in the starry heavens, and all stories, characters, and adventures narrated by mythology concentrate on the active powers among the stars, who are the planets.”\n\nThis is quite a claim, to say the least, when one remembers that, at the very dawn of civilization, the Sumerian list of deities already contained more than five thousand names with which to reckon—think about it! Accepting that most of these names constitute nothing but a litany of epithets bestowed on a much shorter list of deities, the deities themselves and the tales told about them remain quite numerous. And yet, as we shall see, this was not merely a case of epithets, for the deities themselves were often inadvertently duplicated, triplicated, and so forth.\n\nOn the other hand, to maintain that all mythological characters reduce to a handful of planets, and that all mythological tales are descriptive of planetary motions, is not, in my opinion, a defensible position. After all, in the end, man found it expedient to recognize divinity in just about everything, creating deities who would lord it over such concepts as birth, health, sleep, and death, and a thousand other issues to boot. Even so, I will maintain that if we restrict ourselves to the world’s major myths, de Santillana and von Dechend’s claim can be validated.",

                    "content": "the authors in question had it noted, “Aristotle was proud to state it as known that the gods were originally stars, even if popular fantasy had later obscured this truth.” Aristotle’s own words read as follows:\n\n“A tradition has been handed down by the ancient thinkers of very early times ... to the effect that these heavenly bodies are gods ... The rest of their tradition has been added later in a mythological form to influence the vulgar ...”\n\nTranslators and other commentators have since attempted to fault Aristotle since, as they have pointed out, the gods are not identified as planets in the earliest extant Greek sources. Thus, M. Tredennick, who translated Aristotle’s works for the famed Loeb Classical Library, thought it appropriate to append a footnote to the above passage which, in part, reads:\n\n“This statement [of Aristotle] is not literally true. The planets do not seem to have been associated with the gods of popular mythology until the 4th century B.C.”\n\nTredennick then referred his readers to John Burnet, an earlier authority on the subject, who had written:\n\n“In classical Greek literature no planets but Hesperos [Venus as Evening Star] & Eosphoros [the Morning Star] are mentioned by name at all ... Mercury appears for the first time by name [as Hermes] in [Plato’s] Timaeus 38e, and other discussions.”",

                    "content": "W. D. Ross was another modern translator of Aristotle who appended a similar disclaimer to the original passage quoted above.\n\nWhat the above authorities, and others since then, have failed to take into consideration is that, at bottom, the characteristics of the Greek gods were identical to the known planetary deities of other, and older, races with whom the Greeks came in contact and from whom they borrowed much of their cosmological and cosmogonical lore. That this knowledge, as per Aristotle, had to be reaffirmed was due to a multitude of factors, the least of which not being the “forgetting” of cosmic history by the Greek nation. When Solon visited Egypt, he was informed that “neither he nor any other Hellene knew anything worth mentioning about the times of old.” He was told that “there is no old opinion handed down among you [Greeks] by ancient tradition, nor any science which is hoary with age.” The Greeks, according to the Egyptian sages, knew “nothing of what happened in ancient times” and this, supposedly, was due to the survivors of previous natural catastrophes who, for whatever reason, had left “no written record” behind them.\n\nThe gods’ eventual disassociation from the planets was also abetted by the fact that, like other nations, the Greeks were wont to allude to the planets by a different set of names when dealing with astronomical, as opposed to cosmogonical, matters. Thus, as indicated by Burnet above, we come across Saturn, who was Kronos, referred to as Phaenon; Jupiter, who was Zeus, as Phaethon; and so forth. It should be noted, however, that these astronomical terms were not themselves devoid of mythic characteristics—so that even in purely astronomical treatises, it was difficult to disassociate the study of planets from that of the gods.",

Having been widely forgotten by his immediate, but not his earlier, ancestors, he simply rediscovered this verity and sought to reaffirm it. Besides, he was not the only one to offer the assertion. Others maintained and voiced identical opinions.",
                    "content": "Among the Greeks, Lucian of Samosata also knew this truth. Thus he tells us that “from both Homer the poet and the epics of Hesiod we should understand that the ancients were of one mind with the astrologers,” and that it is “the conjunction of Venus and Mars” that “creates the poetry of Homer.” Plato, who recognized the same truth on his own, had it verified by the Egyptians.\n\nThe Romans, who, in their turn, borrowed many of their deities from the Greeks, were no different. It is, in fact, to them that we owe the present names of the planets in the western world so that, to this day, the planets still bear the names of the gods.\n\nKronos became Saturnus, the god of civilization. Zeus became Iuppiter, Diespiter, or simply lovis, and, like his counterparts throughout the world, was considered king of all the gods. Ares became Marspiter, also known as Mavors—pronounced Ma-oors—or Marmar, a god of war as blood-thirsty as his Greek counterpart. Aphrodite became Venus, retaining her position as the queen of Jove and feminine beauty. Hermes became Mirqurius, or Mercurius, and was honored as the god of merchandise.\n\nThe synonymy of planets with gods was so entrenched among the Romans that Cicero denied the possibility of planetary orbital changes simply because he believed such changes to be contrary to the planets’ divine nature.\n\nThis belief, that the gods were really deified astronomical bodies, even touched primitive peoples. Thus the name of the great Polynesian god, Ta’urua, simply means “star”—and here we cannot help but note the similarity of this name to that of Tara, an epithet of Kali/Durga, mentioned earlier, which also means “star,” even though no etymological connection between the two names has yet come to light. In old records of Tahiti, the name Ta’urua is applied to Fomathaut, a star in the constellation Pisces; to Orion’s belt; to Alphard or Cor Hydra; Betelgeuse; Canopus in the constellation Argo; Deneb in Cygnus; and Sirius. Each particular star was then identified by a clarifying epithet added to the name Ta’urua. The same name, however, was also applied to the planets Jupiter and Venus. The former was designated Ta’urua-o-rai’i-taetae’a-o-Havai’i-i-te-tua and the latter as Ta’urua-e-hiti-Matavai.\n\nAmong the Skidi branch of the Pawnee Indians of North America, there were some who, in a sense, might be considered astronomers. These men compiled star maps; identified the constellations and the brightest stars among them; noted the planets and recorded their movements. The beginning of the Pawnee ceremonial year was coordinated in rites. As G. A. Dorsey discovered, “the greater part of the [Pawnee] heavenly gods were... ",
