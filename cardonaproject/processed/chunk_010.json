Assuming the name of his god, he became popularly known as Emperor Elagabalus. When he moved from Emesa to Rome, he took the meteoritic “image” of his deity with him, which “image” also became known as the Elagabalus, and installed it in the temple of Kybele.",

The Sumerian name for “iron” was an-bar, which means “fire from heaven.” The Hittites, who were among the first, if not the first, in the ancient world to use weapons made out of iron, called the metal ku-an, which also translates as “fire from heaven,” since, as they claimed, iron originated in the sky. The Assyrians also extracted iron from ore, but, to them, the metal was said to have been “fragments from heaven.” In Egypt, the name for “iron” was bia-en-pet or baat-en-pet, which translates as “metal of heaven” (although “thunderbolt of heaven” has also been suggested). In Egypt, the association of meteoric iron with the gods, and especially with the evil god Set, seems to have led to a taboo against the use of the metal. A similar religious taboo is also known to have existed in ancient Israel. The Old Testament preaches against the use of iron tools in the construction of Yahweh's altar. The taboo against the use of iron was also observed in Greek and Roman cults. A religious exception seems to have been allowed in Egyptian funerary rites. “Metal of heaven” was used in the manufacture of small symbolic instruments in connection with the rites of the dead and such items were often interred with the deceased. These religious instruments are mentioned in the Egyptian prayers for the dead even though, because of the corrosive nature of iron, few of them have ever been retrieved. Meteorites were also worshipped in Greece. Concerning this practice, Pausanias wrote: “Orchomenos has a sanctuary of Dionysos, but the most ancient one is consecrated to the Graces. They pay particular worship to rocks, saying they fell out of heaven...”. The “image” on Cyprus was a stone which fell from the sky.",

                    "content": "The great “image” of Pallas Athena, known as the Palladium, in the citadel of Troy, on which the safety of the city was held to depend, was also said to have been a stone which fell to Earth. So was the sacred stone at Delphi, said to belong to Kronos, who was Saturn. As G. A. Wainwright wrote in 1936: “Plenty of [other meteorites] could be mentioned as being kept in churches or temples, but let that of Casa Grande suffice. It was found in a room of an ancient Mexican temple carefully swathed in bandages.” Let not the reader delude himself into thinking that such beliefs and practices were merely the result of ancient and/or primitive naiveté. Modern-day Muslims might not care to admit it, but the most holy object in all of Islam, the Black Stone, which today is incorporated into the Ka’aba at Mecca, is also a meteorite. Here it is only fair to point out that Immanuel Velikovsky’s claim that the Black Stone was believed to have fallen from the planet Venus cannot be substantiated. Even so, there seems to be no doubt that the Black Stone “had streaked out of the heavens one night in the forgotten past,” and that it is nothing but a meteorite. There has been some speculation that this meteorite had originally been reddish in hue and that its present black color is simply due to the patina of ages. To my knowledge, this has never been ascertained. In fact, there is reason to believe that the Stone’s blackness coincided with a special characteristic of mythic significance. That the Ka’aba was originally a shrine to the god and planet Saturn has now been documented. Also, the myths and astronomical lore of various nations connect the color black with this very planet and its deity. As Hildegard Lewy pointed out, “Saturn is frequently called the ‘black’ or ‘dark’ planet.” It is this particular Saturnian curiosity that points to the Black Stone’s selection as a Saturnian symbol. As Lewy wrote: “As this Black Stone was revered in a sanctuary dedicated to the cult of the ‘Black Planet’ Saturn, we comprehend that a black meteorite, or a black stone resembling a meteorite, was thought to be a piece of the ‘Black Planet,’ which means a part of the.",

Despite reports of stones falling from the sky, scientists “preferred to doubt” all such reports. What is even more perplexing, they also preferred “to change their statements to conform with acknowledged scientific theories.” When, for example, a large stone was reported to have fallen from the sky near Luce in 1768, the Académie des Sciences sent the French chemist, Antoine Laurent Lavoisier, to investigate. Having done so, he concluded that nothing of the sort could have transpired and that all those who were said to have witnessed the event had either been mistaken or lying. The reasoning was simple: As that indomitable arch-enemy of establishment science, Charles Fort, put it, since there were no stones in the sky to start with, no stones could have fallen from the sky. Because of such episodes, many European museums ended up discarding genuine meteorites, which would have been of great benefit to the scientific world in later years, simply because they thought of them “as shameful relics of a superstitious past.” One meteorite from that era, however, was preserved “due to the protection given to it by the bishop of Zagreb’s consistory.” This was the iron meteorite which had fallen at Hraschina in 1751. Sworn statements by eye-witnesses were collected and, together with the iron fragment, were sent to the Austrian emperor. Eventually, both the documents and the meteorite came into the possession of the Vienna museum and the attention of the physicist E. F. F. Chladni who commenced on a battle against the scientific establishment. In his paper of 1794, Chladni defended the trustworthiness of the Hraschina and other meteorites and was bold enough to claim that these objects originated as cosmic debris which had penetrated Earth’s atmosphere and fallen to the ground. Most of his colleagues, however, remained skeptical. But then, in 1803, so many of the damned things fell and landed on the ground—an entire shower of meteorites actually—that the new investigator, Jean Baptiste Biot, had no option but to accept their extraterrestrial origin. Even so, when, in 1807, two Yale scientists claimed that meteorites had recently struck the ground at Weston, Connecticut, disbelief was still rampant. Thus, when Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States, “who included paleontology among his many interests,” was told of the incident, he is reported to have replied that: “It is easier to believe that two Yankee professors would lie, than that stones would fall from heaven.” There is a lesson to be learned here because, since the ancients, who had been reporting the fall of such objects, swaddling them, worshipping them, etcetera, have been proven right on this score, they should perhaps be given the benefit of the doubt concerning their reports of other astronomical occurrences which science has not yet had reason to accept as being valid.",

This is stressed here because the uninitiated have a tendency to perceive the Mesoamerican Indians as having been a primitive tribe of people, adorned in colorful costumes and exotic feathered headdresses, whose brutal religion incorporated human sacrifice on a massive scale. Other than their description as primitive, the above holds true. But these Indians had also been capable of constructing monumental buildings the artistic adornment of which boggles the imagination, and, more than that, of organizing and maintaining a civilization that worked extremely well for as long as it lasted. Among the Maya, the priests were the ones who normally acted as the keepers of scientific knowledge, including that branch we today would call astronomy. It was not, however, merely the priesthood which was obsessed with such lore but, as Juan de Torquemada recorded a century after the Spanish conquest of Mexico, even kings. Of Netzahualpilli, the king of Texcoco, he had this to report: “They say he was a great astrologer and prided himself much on his knowledge of the motions of the celestial bodies; and being attached to this study, that he caused inquiries to be made throughout the entire extent of his dominions, for all such persons as were at all conversant with it, whom he brought to his court, and imparted to them whatever he knew, and ascending by night on the terraced roof of his palace, he thence considered the stars, and disputed with them all on difficult questions connected with them.” It is obvious from the pictorial elements included in various codices that pyramid-temples, as well as other structures, were utilized as astronomical observation posts. One of these codices even shows a priest stationed in a temple doorway, peering through a cross-piece to observe a celestial event. In fact, the symbol of an eye located within, or in conjunction with, such cross-pieces appears on other codices which treat of astronomical matters, thus indicating that this simple instrument was the one most frequently used in astronomical observations. Granted, most, although not all, of Mesoamerican astronomical knowledge is calendric in nature. It might therefore be countered that, since calendars are the outcome of solar and lunar motions, one should not be all that impressed with their knowledge. After all, as complex as they are, the motions of the Sun and the Moon are more observable than the fall of meteors. The computation of such systems is not, however, all that easily determined. After all, the calendar we presently use in the Western World was not computed until 1582. The Mesoamericans’ mathematical abilities, especially when it came to the calculation of time-periods and, quite naturally, the formulation of calendars (of which they possessed more than one), formed the dictatorial power that held sway over Maya life. The vigesimal system they employed—that is, a progression by twenties rather than by tens as in our decimal system—enabled them to conduct complex calculations in their studies of astronomical phenomena. They understood, and utilized, the concept of zero a thousand years before Europeans did. They learned how to accurately predict eclipses and were able to tabulate the motions of the planet Venus with a precision that has stunned modern astronomers. The Dresden Codex, for example, gives a total of 11,960 days for 405 lunar cycles which, when compared to the modern value of 11,959.89 days, discloses an error of only one day every 380 years.",

Among various ancient peoples, the star cluster known as the Pleiades also served to pinpoint the beginning of the year, the cycle of the seasons, as well as the occurrence of festivals. In this respect, the Mesoamericans were no different. They, too, were enticed with the observation of the Pleiades. Known to European observers as the Seven Sisters, this group of stars received considerable attention all over the world. As Anthony Aveni informs us: “The Sherente of Brazil still use the Pleiades today to mark the seasons. They say that the year commences in June when the Pleiades first appear as the sun leaves the constellation of Taurus...The Navajo dignify the Pleiades by associating them with their principal deity, Black God, creator of fire and light. In fact, a recognizable form of this group appears on the face of Black God. “The Aztecs determined the occurrence of their most important feast day by the appearance of the Pleiades. According to Sahagún, the ceremony of the Binding of the Years took place every fifty-two years and began when the Pleiades transited the zenith at midnight.” As we have already noted, Saturn was known as the black god and/or black planet among various peoples of the ancient world. I therefore feel confident that the Navajo Black God mentioned by Aveni in the quote above will be found to have originally been a personification of the same planet. If this turns out to be correct, the association of the Pleiades with this planetary deity requires an explanation since this constellation has no observable celestial connection with the planet Saturn.",

According to Charles Lacombe, the 365-day calendar, as illustrated in the Codex Tro-Cortesianus, is “unbelievable in its perfection and simplicity, instantly performing the incredible combination of mathematical functions required to program and retrieve the mathematical data.” How were these people, bereft of optical instruments save for a simple device constructed out of two crossed pieces of wood, able to calculate all this with such breathtaking precision? As Guy Anequin tells us: “Their measurements were based entirely on sighting, calculations of triangulation, and measurement of the movements of shadows. They observed that the stars, and in particular the sun, were seen at different angles according to the time of the year. They also noted that daily hours of sunlight varied from one day to another according to these positions — they thus strove to locate the solstices, the extreme solar positions for the longest and the shortest days of the year. For this, they probably used a gnomon, a kind of sight made with only a vertical rod. The shadow on the ground at midday on June 21 was shortest, while at midday on December 21 (the winter solstice) was the longest. The various sightings taken at sunrise from a fixed point will give a different angle throughout the year—for in winter the sun rises further to the south and in summer further to the north on the eastern horizon. Scrutiny of the night sky must have been no less important than that of day. Observation of lunar transformations and trajectories were noted in the Dresden Codex.",
