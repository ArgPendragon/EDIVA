        "main_text": "“It [was] gloomy in the sense that Earth [did] not experience the sharp contrasts of the modern day and night; but the climate [was] uniformly moist and warm. Vegetation [was] lush, animals [were] plentiful and life easy for herbivores, carnivores and omnivore-scavengers, such as man, alike.””® PHOTOPERIODISM Photoperiodism, not to be confused with photosynthesis, is the response of organisms to the duration of light and darkness generated by the succession of day and night. It should however be noted right from the start that temperature, nutrition, and environmental factors can greatly modify this response. Also, closely related varieties of species can, and do, re- spond differently to identical photoperiodic conditions due to inherited differences in their make-up. When it comes to fauna, the most conspicuous activities correlated to photoperiodism consist of changes in pelage and/or plumage, the migratory instincts of birds, and the repro- ductive process, each of which occurs with marked regularity at a particular time each year. When animals held in captivity are subjected to artificial lighting conditions which mimic a day-night succession that is different from the natural one, reproduction, bird migration, and other activities can be induced out of season. This seems to prove that such activities are regulated by the changing daily periods of light and darkness—in other words by the succes- sion of the seasons. In artificial situations, as little as nine hours of light per day was sufficient for stimulating the physiological changes responsible for these activities. The response, it has been found, becomes rapid under long days, and sluggish under short ones. Thus, changes in physiological responses, such as change in breeding season, occurs in certain birds and mammals when transported from a southern to a northern latitude and/or vice versa. And yet, in equatorial regions, where day lengths are constant, mammals and birds continue to breed, change their plumage, and migrate as if the day lengths actually varied. Do they then keep count of the days? Can they keep time? Or is it that they have adapted so well to their envi- ronment that their physiology changes without response to photoperiodism? To be sure, studies of certain species of birds failed to show any influence of light on their reproductive cycle.”” Would animals not breed had there been no succession of day and night? Would they stop breeding in an environment of perpetual dawn and an everlasting spring? Or would they adapt? The flowering of plants, the formation of roots, runners, tubers, and bulbs are also controlled by photoperiodism. The photoperiodic reaction of plants takes place in the leaves, but the response occurs elsewhere. Not all plants, however, react the same way. Short-day plants, for instance, fail to flower when days exceed a certain duration; long-day plants fail to flower unless days exceed a certain duration. The critical day lengths for these plants, moreover, differ widely not only from species to species but also among varieties of the same",

What was not understood at the time the phenomenon of photoperiodism was named was that the response of plants is controlled by the duration of darkness and not of light—that is by the length of the night as opposed to the length of the day.¥ May we be bold enough to suggest that this might be a residue from an earlier environment in which the world was cast in perpetual semi-darkness? Red light can prevent the flowering of short-day plants while promoting that of long-day ones. However, the inhibition of flowering by short-day plants through red light can be prevented by the inclusion of red light of greater wave length (or what is known as far-red).” Since Saturn is here posited to have been a brown dwarf star, its propensity of red light, mainly in the far-red, would therefore have been conducive to plant growth. On the other hand, as every gardener knows, some flowers close up at night and re-open when the Sun comes up. What, then, would have happened to such plants attempting to thrive in a world where the succession of day and night was replaced by a perpetual dawn-like murkiness? The answer is actually simple: Had such plants existed at the time, they would have had to adapt to their environment as others have done, and continue to do, in the present world. THE SUB-TROPICAL ARCTIC As early as the nineteenth century it was “admitted by all scientific authorities that at one time the regions within the Arctic Circle enjoyed a tropical or nearly tropical climate.” These words were written in 1885 by William Warren in his attempt to prove that man’s original Paradise had been located at Earth’s north polar region.” He did not assert this as merely his say-so; he named authorities and quoted from them. “The Arctic regions, probably up to the North Pole, were not only free from ice, but were covered with a rich and luxuriant vegetation.”*! “One of the most startling and important of the scientific discoveries of the last twenty years has been that of the relics of a luxuriant Miocene flora in various parts of the Arctic regions. It is a discovery which was totally unexpected, and is even now considered by many men of science to be completely unintelligible...”°? “Tn the early Tertiary period the climate of the northern hemisphere, as shown by the Eocene animals and plants, was very much hotter than it is at present; partaking, in- deed, of a sub-tropical character. In the Middle Tertiary or Miocene epoch the tem- perature, though not high, was still much warmer than that now enjoyed by the",

In the greater part of the Miocene and preceding Eocene epochs the fauna and flora of Central Europe were sub-tropical, and a vegetation resembling that now seen in Northern Europe extended into the Arc- tic regions as far as they have yet been explored, and probably reached the Pole itself. In the Mesozoic ages the predominance of reptile life and the general character of the fossil types of that great class of vertebrata indicate a warm climate and an absence of frost between the 40th parallel of latitude and the Pole...” And yet, seeing as so much has been discovered since the nineteenth century, can we still adhere to these conclusions? More so than ever. THE CANADIAN HIGH ARCTIC The Canadian island of Axel Heiberg, in Nunavut, well above the Arctic Circle, well be- yond the present tree line, is littered with the remains of ancient forests—stumps, logs, and remnants of leaves and even fruit. Although the relics of such forests are known from other parts of the world, those on Axel Heiberg are exceptional because, unlike other remains, they have not been petrified. On the contrary, the remains have maintained their original form and even tissue. The retrieved wood still splits and splinters and can be carved with a sharp knife. It burns as good as modern wood. It has even retained the hue of soft lumber. Not only trees have been preserved, but also leaf mats the likes of which one finds on the ground in modern forests. Barren, gaunt, and forbidding as the island now is, its rolling hills bear the traces of more than twenty separate forest layers, stacked on top of each other, all of which are found in situ, testifying to growth on the spot rather than transmission by the forces of nature.

As Art Johnson who, independent of Basinger, have been studying these re- mains, noted: “We have no forests on Earth where the trees are so big and have to sit in the dark for three months.”** Axel Heiberg Island is not the only area in Canada’s High Arctic where the remains of ancient forests have been found. The coal-bearing sediments of the Eureka Sound Group scattered throughout most of the Arctic Archipelago also contain such remains. Plants dated to the Paleocene from the Fosheim Peninsula of Ellesmere Island resemble similar Paleocene flora from Western Canada’s interior, indication of a cosmopolitan temperate zone.” Some of the plants from these Tertiary forests have been described as being akin to those growing in the present cypress swamps of Florida.” Others, like oak, do not grow in swamps. Trees from the middle Eocene in the same area reached up to 50 meters high. The fossils of animals found buried amid the remains of these forests—ancestors of the horse and rhinoceros, giant lizards, land tortoises, salamanders, snakes, alligators, crocodiles, flying lemurs*'—all testify to the warmth of the climate at that time, as so does the discovery of fossil palm trees and huge exotic ferns by Soviet paleobotanists in the islands of Spitsbergen in the Svalbard archipelago far within the Arctic Circle.” Even fossil tapirs, the descendants of which now live in the equatorial Amazon forest, were found on Ellesmere Is- land.* As Ian Johnson (not to be confused with Art Johnson, cited above) noted, finding the tropics in such high latitudes raises serious implications for paleontologists: “This far from the equator means 4 months of polar darkness...If the night tempera- ture was always 10 degrees Celsius, in conjunction with 4 months of darkness, plants would die. Mammals found to date are likely middle Eocene creatures. Crocodiles, lizards and turtles are well adapted to forest life but some of the discovered species [the crocodilians] cannot tolerate near freezing temperatures for very long. This im- plies that there had to be considerable warmth in the Eocene High Arctic all through- out the year.” And: “Crocodilians are a test of the reconstructed polar forest community because they have changed little since the end of the Triassic...the crocodilians have been consis- tent throughout their long evolutionary history in their limited tolerance of the cold.",

Crocodiles require shallow water, but crocodiles in water that is colder than 65° F tend to sink to the bottom in lassitude and drown as they do in places even like Florida during severe cold weather. The scientific establishment, meanwhile, has not been entirely silent when it comes to propositions concerning the solution of the puzzle which the one-time existence of these Arctic forests raise. Thus, for instance, writers in New Scientist proposed that the Arctic Eo- cene’s subtropical climate can be explained if the oceans transported far more heat to the poles than they do at present.” But evidence of the atmospheric circulation required for this, which depends on temperature differential, is lacking. Moreover, the small size of particles retrieved from Eocene deep-sea sediments confirm the lack of wind speeds at that time.” Continental drift must also be ruled out because Axel Heiberg Island is “only a few hundred kilometres closer to the North Pole than it was when the forests flour- ished”*’—which is definitely not enough for it to have been located outside the Arctic Circle at that time. As Johnson noted: “Modern geological field work has confirmed that the north- ern lands of the globe have been located in polar latitudes for at least the last 100 million years, despite ongoing continental drift.”” Leo Hickey’s “observation” that “fossil leaf fragments indicate that the deciduous leaves were enormous” has remained somewhat controversial.*' He, however, claims to have returned from his 1979 field season with fossil leaf fragments, one of which measured two feet in width.” Gigantic leaves are known to develop when plants are grown under constant lighting conditions. Thus, his conclusion was that these forests “grew under conditions of continuous light.”* Hickey then proposed that a bank of thick fog could have hung over the forests during the Arctic winter, which fog would have retained enough heat to cause a greenhouse effect. What would have caused the fog, or why such a fog is not at present evident in the polar regions, he left unexplained. Curt Teichert was honest enough to admit that “attempts to explain rapid climatic changes throughout the Tertiary have been ‘especially vexing and unsatisfactory’.”® As D. H. Campbell wrote: “It is difficult to imagine any possible conditions of climate in which",

But one has to keep in mind that if Saturn acted as the sun during mankind’s primitive past, it must also have been Earth’s sun during ages long before. Moreover, since Saturn’s present illumination and heat are nowhere close to what we have postulated them to have been during man’s early career on this planet, it stands to reason that its radiant energy dissipated relatively fast. This would also make us assume that, in ages prior to the advent of mankind, Saturn’s radiant energy, and in fact even its mass, must have been greater still. It is even possible that its illumination, at close quarters to Earth, would have been bright enough to bathe the world in perpetual daylight rather than the constant dusk that primitive man later experienced. As we have seen, scientific consensus favors a dimmer sun during Earth’s past geologic ages. Could not this dimmer sun have been the Saturnian sun which later greeted man’s appearance on Earth? (What should also be kept in mind is that if our hypothesis is anywhere close to being correct, the dating of Earth’s past geologic ages would be based on fallacious evidence.) FROM POLE TO POLE AND IN BETWEEN I have been stressing the discoveries in the Canadian High Arctic but, if the truth is to be known, similar evidence is available from other parts of the northern hemisphere. Oswald Heer described 2,632 Arctic plant species, 1,627 of which were actually discovered by him. In his seven-volume epic on the subject, published between the years 1868 and 1883, Heer stressed the luxuriant plant life that thrived during the Tertiary in northern polar regions. Among those that grew in Greenland, he noted magnolias and fig trees.* Similarly in Spits- bergen where he noted the Tertiary thriving of such trees as pines, firs, spruces, cypresses, elms, hazels, and even water lilies.” Forests which once flourished in Spitsbergen have left seams of coal from twenty-five to thirty feet thick. Fossil specimens of fig palms and the gi- ant Redwood (Sequoia gigantea), which now grow in California, have been retrieved from an area stretching from the Bering Strait to north of Labrador. As D. H. Campbell admitted: “It is difficult to imagine any possible conditions of climate in which these plants could grow so near the pole, deprived of sunlight for many months of the year.”® Fossil corals, which can only grow in tropical waters, were also discovered there in large formations. Corals, in fact, grew all over polar North America—in Alaska, Canada, and even in Greenland.” The same situation is evident at the opposite end of the world in the freezing regions of Antarctica. The biggest problem here is that, in past ages, Antarctica was warmer than the tropics and equatorial regions themselves by about 90° Fahrenheit.” Early in the twentieth",
