        "main_text": "“The discrepancies between the true cosmic placing of the Sun, planets, and Milky Way may be due to a distorted record. We can hardly suppose that people with so accurate a calendar [and with such accurate knowledge concerning the motions of the planet Venus] were ignorant of the general positions of the heavenly bodies.”™ Because, as we have already seen, mis- translations did creep into ancient records, Nicholson’s suspicion of a “distorted re- cord” is not, in itself, unreasonable. Be- sides mistranslations, however, there has also been a fair amount of misin- terpretation. Here Nicholson was trapped by her predecessors who had already identified certain Mayan objects as the Sun, the Moon, and the Milky Way. It did not occur to her that these objects might have been misidentified. Such misidentifications and, therefore, misinterpretations litter past works on mythology. Ask anyone who has even a modest knowledge of mythology to name the sun-god par excellence, and he or she would probably point to the Egyptian Ra (or Re). And why not? Is that not what most books on mythology claim? The Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology is very specific: “Ra (or Re or Phra), which probably signifies ‘creator,’ is the name of the sun, sovereign lord of the sky.”” So also with James Frazer, who echoed this Egyptian dictum when he stated: “That Ra was both the physical sun and the sun-god is of course undisputed ... “” But then one conducts an in-depth study of this Egyptian “physical sun” and “sun- ‘The Egyptian god Ra, said to be the god” only to come to the realization that, personification of the Sun, but whose motions and characteristics do not fit the role of the Sun.",

        "main_text": "except for the fact that Ra shone brightly in the sky, the characteristics, and even motions, attributed to Ra do not fit the role of the Sun. Thus, for example, Ra was often lauded as “Lord of the Circles” and as “he who entereth [or liveth] in the Circle.”” He was described as “the sender forth of light into his Circle” and as the “Governor of [his] circle.”™ What is this Circle that the hymns allude to? Egyptologists will immediately inform us that this Circle of which the hymns speak was what the Egyptians referred to as the Duat (or Tuat), a word that has been rendered into English as “the Underworld.” That may be so, but the fact remains that Ra was said to have shone from within it. What becomes obvious, in other words, is that, whatever Ra once signified, it was a celestial body that resided within a circle or band or ring. As we all know, the Sun does not send forth its rays into a circle; it does not reside in a ring. There will now be those who will tell me that, under certain conditions, the Sun is seen to be surrounded by a ring. They will of course be alluding to that atmospheric re fraction which lends a halo, known as parhelia, to the solar orb. But not only is this too rare an apparition to have earned Ra his title of “Governor of his Circle” and/or “Lord of the Circles,” it is also a phenomenon that is restricted to northern regions and hardly, if ever, seen at the latitude of Egypt. But there is more. When pictured on the walls of temples and on papyri, Ra is often shown surmounted with a red or golden disc, which is not inappropriate if the Sun is truly being represented. In the liturgies dedicated to him, however, Ra is described as having shed a green, rather than a golden, light. Thus a hymn to Ra states: “Thou hast come with thy splendours, and thou hast made heaven and earth bright with thy rays of pure emerald light.”” In another hymn we read: “O Ra ... the heir of eternity, self-begotten and self-born, king of earth, prince of the netherworld ... thou dost rise in the horizon of heaven and sheddest upon the world beams of emerald light ...“® Not only did this sun shed a green, or emerald, light, it itself was green. As Donald Mackenzie informed his readers, in his form of Sebek-Tum-Ra, this sun was the “radiant green disk.” “Hail Green One,” was the manner in which Ra was lauded.” Mythologists have nothing to say by way of explaining why the ancient Egyptians al- luded to the Sun as having been green and shedding a green light. And, as long as they con- tinue to believe that Ra was the Sun, how can they? Does our Sun shed a green light? Is the disk of the present sun green? Consider further the motions of the celestial object called Ra. In a statement found in one of the Coffin Texts, the deity is addressed with these words: “You shall go up upon the great West side of the sky and go down upon the great East side of the earth.”” Is not this contrary to what the present Sun does? Does the Sun today “go up” in the west? Does it “go down” in the east? Thus Faulkner, who translated this passage, could not help stating that this “unexpected reversal of the points of the compass is incomprehensible”™—and ended up by",

        "main_text": "blaming what to him was an inconsistency on “a blunder in an early copy which no one has noticed or at least attempted to correct.”® This explanation, however, presupposes that there must be other texts which give the rising and setting of Ra correctly, that is in accordance with the present motions of the Sun. But, as David Talbott has indicated, “wherever the di- rection of the [sun] ship’s movement is explicitly connected with the phases of morning and evening the texts always reverse the direction expected by the solar interpretation.”® Worse than that, when sailing in his ship, or boat, Ra is said to move down at dawn,” and “upstream” at night,® contrary to what we see the Sun doing in our sky at present. There are many other characteristics of Ra that do not conform with the appearance and motions of our Sun which, in order not to anticipate the major thesis of this book, I will leave for later chapters. In the meantime I would simply like to add that the items I have so far touched upon have not really gone unnoticed by mythologists. Each and every datum that will be analyzed in this work have been noted and, in some cases, even discussed. Unfortu- nately, these incongruous astronomical oddities have never been collected in one place in an effort to analyze them as a whole—which is exactly what I intend to do in the chapters that will follow. CONTRADICTIONS Contradictions permeate ancient accounts. This is especially true, but not restricted to, the tales contained in the Old Testament and those that constitute what is generally termed Clas- sical mythology. To give but just two examples: In chapter six of the Book of Genesis, which describes the loading of the ark in prepara- tion for the coming deluge, it is written that God commanded Noah to take aboard two, a male and a female, of every living beast.” But in chapter seven of the same book, the com- mand to Noah is to take aboard two only of unclean beasts, but seven of every clean beast as well as of every kind of fowl.” Why the difference? The second example I will give comes from Greek mythology and concerns the goddess Athena. According to Hesiod, the father of Greek didactic poetry, Athena was born from the head of Zeus,” a tale that became very popular among the ancient Greeks. But, despite the notability of Hesiod’s tale, Athena’s parentage, as also the nature of her birth, was not unanimously agreed upon among the Hellenes. To some it was Poseidon who fathered Athena, Zeus becoming her adopted father only because the goddess disowned the god of the sea.” To others, Athena’s father was Itonus, king of Iton in Phithiotis.® Next in popularity to Hesiod’s tale was that which claimed that Athena was fathered by the giant Pallas whom she later slew and flayed.” According to Apollodorus, on the other hand, Pallas was the name of Athena’s playmate whom she also slew, but accidentally, while engaged in friendly",

Better still: If, as stated above, mythic lore was faithfully transmitted by word of mouth through the ages before it became engraved in writing, how did we end up with so many different versions of the same tale? While it is tempting to blame such contradictions on faulty recording when these myths were first written down, such is not always the case. The example given above concerning Noah from the Book of Genesis was not chosen at random. It was chosen specifically to clarify a conundrum. Thus, in that passage which tells that only two of every beast was to be taken aboard the ark, the instructions come from Elohim, an ancient name which is usually translated as “God” in most English versions of the Old Testament. But in the passage which specifies that seven should be the number taken on board of the beasts designated as clean, the command is said to have come from Yahweh, sometimes rendered “Jehovah,” another ancient name which is usually translated as “the Lord” in English versions of the same work. We shall not, at this point, involve ourselves in a discussion concerning whether or not these two names— Yahweh and Elohim—were but two different designations for one and the same deity. We shall leave that for later. Biblical scholars, however, had long ago realized that the Old Testament preserves more than one tradition, and that, among other things, these different traditions can be recognized by the name applied to what one usually considers as having been “God.” One of these traditions referred to the deity as Elohim, another tradition referred to him as Yahweh. Thus Biblical scholars refer to these different versions, among others, as the Elohist tradition on the one hand, and the Yahwist tradition on the other. Origi- nally, these different traditions belonged to different peoples who had passed on their tradi- tions by word of mouth, without change, from one generation to the next. But, as happened so often in the past, these different peoples merged to become one nation even though each faction was persistent in retaining its particular version of what they believed to have tran- spired in the past. At an even later time, when they decided to put their history into writing, these various traditions were incorporated as a unified, but not seamless, whole. And that, to put it simply, is what the Old Testament, as it exists today, consists of. So, similarly, with the ancient Greeks, who referred to themselves as Hellenes, suppos- edly after Helen of Troy, a nation that was forged from the remnants of earlier civilizations and wandering tribes—Pelasgians, Minoans, Mycenaeans, Achaeans, Trojans, Ionians, Dori- ans, and heaven knows who else—each of whom brought their own traditions into that Indo- European melting pot that has become known as Greek history and Classical mythology. Even so, why should there be more than one version of any one particular myth? Here I can best ask the reader to consider an event from the modern world—the blowing up, by the invading army, of the colossal swastika that had towered above the Germans in symbolic splendor above so many Nazi rallies. As Lewis Greenberg noted: “There appears to be some confusion over which swastika was dynamited, with some opting for one over the Reichstag",
