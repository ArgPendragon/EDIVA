        "main_text": "likely,” it is the first proposal that best fits the scheme. It was a “pre-existing polar configu- ration” that was disturbed “by the increasing influence of the Sun.” What seems to have transpired is that Earth’s axis was temporarily and slightly dislodged as the Sun attempted to separate it from Saturn. The Saturnian system’s entry into the Sun’s domain, however, was a prolonged development that unfolded in a series of awe-inspiring events. For a while of relative short duration, Earth teetered slightly off balance, and it was during this precarious episode that Saturn was seen to slowly circle around its former station- ary spot. The god wandered for a time. But Saturn was soon to reassert its hold upon its sat- ellite and the deity returned to his former motionless locale. There is, of course, much that went on before this temporary interlude, and even more that followed it—but the detailed ac- count of all that, complete with the relative evidence, will have to wait for the proposed se- quel to this work. Through all this we have not been able to lay down our dragon’s ugly head—because, if the mechanics behind the break-up of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 are not the ones we seek in explaining the manner in which the Saturnian system could have maintained its axial cou- pling, we are simply back to where we had started at the beginning of this chapter. What Shoemaker-Levy 9 taught us is that linear formations can exist, but only for a short period. That is not what we seek. What is required is a means to keep such a formation linearly aligned for a much longer period—longer than 3 months, longer than 45 years, 100 years, or 200 years. We need to discover a means to keep Saturn and Earth axially coupled for thousands of years, if not even longer. What, then, is the answer? COSMIC JETS The subject of the Saturnian co-axial system was discussed during the private round-table session held for the speakers at the 2000 KRONIA Communications world conference in Portland, Oregon. At that time, the astrophysicist Halton Arp declared that linear formations are not uncommon in the cosmos—to which he added the caveat that such formations are only possible if given a long time to form. While this declaration should have raised eye brows, it raised but little. When, a month later, I asked Arp what linear formations he had in mind,” he referred me to the “condensations” which had been discovered being ejected by galaxies.!© These condensations, as Arp called them, are now known to be “violent jets of plasma that erupt from the cores of some galaxies” !°! in poleward directions. In other words, the jets in ques- tion are shot out along the axis of the galaxy’s rotation. How are these jets formed? Once deemed anathema to astronomy, electric currents are now known to exist through- out the Solar System. As James Peebles declared: “No one today denies the importance of magnetic fields and currents in the solar sys- tem and in its formation. This is now completely accepted.” 102 More than that, as noted earlier in this work, 99% of the universe is now known to consist of plasma, an ionized gas that can conduct electricity. This led the plasma physicist and Nobel laureate Hannes Alfvén to ask: “why shouldn’t plasma still behave the same way for",

        "main_text": "the entire observable universe...?”! As Eric Lerner explains: “In Alfvén’s theory, a galaxy spinning in the magnetic field of space acts as a huge generator, inducing electric currents in the interstellar plasma. The currents flow in great filamentary spirals toward the center of the galaxy, where they turn and flow upwards along the spin axis.”!05 It is this model, according to Alfvén, which accounts for the violent jets that are observed erupting from the centre of galaxies. “Every now and then [says Alfvén], the electric current in a galaxy short-circuits and dumps a vast amount of energy into the core. The galaxy ‘blows a fuse,’ and the blast propels a jet of plasma up the spin axis.” 10 Most astrophysicists, on the other hand, claim that these jets are due to the intense gravity of a black hole harboring at the centre of these galaxies,!°’ even though the existence of black holes themselves has recently been raising some serious doubts. !°8 But when it comes to similar jets expelled by a breed of new stars, to say nothing of the remains of supernovae, the black hole explanation becomes untenable. The Crab Nebula is the remains of just such a star which went supernova in 1054 A.D. The explosion blazed so brightly that it was visible from Earth in broad daylight. Plasma jets similar to the ones seen ejecting from galaxies, to say nothing of a ring of hot plasma, have recently been revealed by X-ray photography around the “inner workings” of the Crab. The plasma ring itself has been calculated to be 200 times wider than the Solar System. This ring is believed to be “powered by particles shooting along the star’s magnetic poles” which cre- ate the twin jets that are seen “firing out perpendicularly to the ring.” !© An identical situa- tion has been found in the Vela supernova remnant. !!0 The same is true of young stars, which are now believed to form from gas and dust which “clump” at the centre of “an envelope of material” surrounded by “a swirling disk.” Magnetic forces then “direct jets along the axis.” Actually, even our own Sun is now posited to have exhibited such bi-polar outflows,!!! to say nothing of a so-called accretion disk, a remnant of which remains to this day as a circum- solar ring of asteroidal dust.!!2 But what have these cosmic jets to do with Earth’s axial coupling with proto-Saturn?",

At least visually, the item in ques- tion bore such an uncanny similarity to my proposed model of the proto-Saturnian brown dwarf star that I believed it impor- tant enough to share with the other at- tendees. Unfortunately, all those present who were interested in the co-axial Sat- urnian system brushed it aside as irrele- vant. Worse still, Arp himself declared the item a mistaken interpretation. It was only during my following corre- spondence with Arp that I realized he had mistaken my new star for something en- tirely different. What I had passed around for consideration was a picture of the star designated as HD 163296. What Arp mis- took it for was the controversial runaway planet—if that is what it is—that had been discovered streaming away from the double star system known as TMR-1 by Susan Terebey. Once this confusion was straightened out, Arp reminded me that he himself had included two photographs of a star emit- ting jets in his 1998 iconoclastic work on redshifts.!'3 Both photographs show the linear polar jet expelled by “a young stella~ object.” What is of more importance, how ever, is that, very much like the jets fron HD 163296, a number of globular clusters sometimes referred to as “knots,” whic/ are astronomical bodies in their own right are imbedded in the star’s jet. These je formations are known as Herbig-Haro ob jects—thus designated HH—named afte: their discoverers, George Herbig and Guil lermo Haro. The one shown on the twc photographs in Arp’s book is HH 34 which",

        "main_text": "also featured in a more recent article by Thomas Greene. !!4 The photograph and graphic reconstruction of HD 163296 that I had initially offered for consideration included three of these globular clusters—labeled HH 409-A, B, and C—imbedded in the star’s bipolar plasma jets. (The jet itself is labeled HH 409.) HH 34 has at least five of these globular clusters all lined up in a row along the star’s polar jet. The tell- tale “accretion disk” is also shown encircling HD 163296. Here, then, was incontestable evidence—nay, proof—that axially aligned linear forma- tions were not only possible, but actually existed in space. They line up along plasma jets ejected poleward, sharing the same axis of rotation as their parent star, exactly as has been posited for Earth and Saturn in this study. Nor can it be said that these configurations are in any way transitory, as in the case of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, since they are believed to exist for millions of years—and thus Arp’s caveat re the “very long time” needed for their formation. Moreover, rather than being uniquely rare cases, Herbig-Haro objects occur in profusion. As of 1994, as many as 250 of such objects had been discovered,!!5 and more keep being added to the list. Now if these stars can line up as much as five bodies in co-axial alignment, what is so impossible about proto-Saturn having had one such body, that is Earth, similarly aligned? Moreover, as those who are already familiar with the Saturn thesis know, and as I intend to show in future sequels, Proto-Saturn eventually ended up having at least three planetary bodies co-axially aligned. Thus, whatever keeps the bodies in Herbig-Haro jets axially aligned would also have kept Saturn and Earth (to say nothing of later planets) in similar alignment. What I must stress here is that all this is not to say that the Saturnian system was a Her- big-Haro object, the immense masses and distances of which alone would preclude such an identity. What is being hypothesized is that the Saturnian system can be visualized to have been a scaled down version of such an “object,” concerning which more will be revealed in our final chapter. At this crucial point, however, the following question presents itself: Did proto-Saturn display jets?",
