        "main_text": "century, E. H. Shackleton discovered seven seams of coal at about latitude 85°, each of which was between three and seven feet thick, testimonials to ancient forests which once grew where now not a single tree, not even a blade of grass, can grow.® The coal seams that run through the Transantarctic Mountains are some of the most extensive on Earth.™ Sandstone, associated with this coal, was found to contain petrified coniferous wood.® Fossils from the Pliocene include well-preserved wood in the form of tree stems as well as roots together with the remains of marine life. (And this is to say nothing about fossil forests from even earlier eras found near the South Pole, when the climate believed to have prevailed at the time should not have allowed such growth.”) In 1935, Admiral Byrd could write that: “Here at the southernmost known mountain in the world, scarcely two hundred miles from the South Pole, was found conclusive evidence that the climate of Antarctica was once temperate or even sub-tropical.”* The Eocene evidence of vast forests in the Antarctic has been attributed to a paleolatitude which was close to that of present Madagascar, while Antarctica is supposed to have still been drifting toward the pole.” Continental drift can therefore be used to solve the mystery by those who adhere to this belief. Melvin Cook, however, is of a different opinion. Ac- cording to his findings, Antarctica “appears not to have moved appreciably in continental shift” since the continents which were once in contact with it “left Antarctica in radial directions,””° thus leaving it more or less in the same locality. Besides, as we have seen, the problem also involves the Arctic regions where, even according to orthodoxy, continental drift cannot save the day. But the enigma entails more than just Earth’s polar regions; it also embraces the latitudes in between. Thus, from early in the twentieth century, many paleobotanists were convinced that “during by far the greater portion of time since the Azoic era, mild, benign climatic conditions have existed.”” According to Dolph Hooker: “It is also the concensus [sic.] that, astonishingly and inexplicably, such conditions were comparatively uniform over most of Earth’s surface; that temperate climate extended both north and south to within the polar circles. It is also believed that, amazingly, seasonal effects during most of geological time have been much less pro- nounced than they are now.” Writing in 1912, F. H. Knowlton stated that:",

This is the regular, the ordinary, the normal condition.”™ By 1953, this belief was still in vogue as exemplified by a paper published by Edwin Colbert in which he wrote: “So far as past climates can be interpreted from the record of fossil vertebrates, it would appear that during much of Earth history the world has enjoyed uniformly ® BH.

        "main_text": "warm, equable climate over most of its surface...the general picture of past vertebrate life is that of warmth-loving animals living over wide ranges of latitude, from the southern tips of the continental land masses through the middle latitudes to regions as far north as the Arctic Circle.”” According to Colbert, “the definitely zoned climatic belts, so familiar to us at the present time, apparently did not exist.””* Moreover, this situation prevailed from long before the Tertiary period as Elso Barghoorn indicated: “From the paleontological evidence available, it would appear that there was very slight climatic zonation between high and low latitudes during the major part of the Carboniferous.” There was thus an added problem that confronted paleobotanists. How could Earth’s po- lar regions been blessed with a sub-tropical climate while the rest of the world remained lit- tle, if at all, warmer than it is at present? As Barbara Bell admitted: “It is by no means clear that solar radiation sufficiently intense to keep the poles as warm as they appear to have been at times would not heat the tropics more than observations indicate.” THE CRETACEOUS CLIMATE Continental drift, through sea-floor spreading, is an ongoing process. Christopher Scotese, a geologist, now predicts that, in another 250 million years, Great Britain will have been pushed to a near-Arctic locale, with the Atlantic Ocean having become nothing but a distant memory. Just as all land masses are believed to have been joined together, 250 mil- lion years ago, in a super-continent which geologists have named Pangaea, a new mega-con- tinent, already dubbed Pangaea Ultima, will by then have formed. Africa would have rammed Europe, uplifting the colliding edges in a Himalaya-like mountain range while eras- ing the Mediterranean in the process. The Atlantic Ocean would first widen, then reverse its course and finally close up completely.” It is not, therefore, surprising that geologists and paleoclimatologists have tended to rely on this process to account for the moving of once-tropical areas into what are now the Arctic and Antarctic regions. As noted in the above report, Great Britain seems destined to do ex- actly that. As we have seen, however, continental drift cannot be made to account for the sub-tropical fauna and flora of the Tertiary period, the remains of which are now found within the Arctic Circle, for the simple reason that the Arctic regions were already close to their present location at the time. But what of earlier eras?",

        "main_text": "While the flora and fauna of the Cretaceous period, calculated to have prevailed 140 to 100 million years ago, was not exactly the same as that of the following Tertiary period, the climate does not seem to have been that much different. As Richard Kerr noted: “The earth of the Cretaceous Period 100 million years ago was unaccountably warm, as it generally had been since the end of the last great ice age 140 million years ear- lier...”” “Explaining Cretaceous climate has been difficult because it differed so from today’s. Coral reefs for which warm water is essential ranged as much as 1500 kilometers closer to the poles than they do today, as did nonseasonal land plants. Deep ocean water that now hovers near freezing was 15° (Celsius) warmer...Alligators and croco- diles seem to have thrived at latitudes as far north as that of present-day Labrador. And there is no evidence of any permanent ice like that which today deeply buries Antarctica and Greenland.”™ “Not only was it generally warmer during the Cretaceous, but it was particularly warmer in the polar regions.”*! Because the position of the continents during the Cretaceous would have been different from the locales they would have occupied later during the Tertiary, scientists continued to seek an answer to the riddle of the earlier climate via continental drift. This was not only be- cause the lands within the present Arctic Circle would have been farther removed from polar regions than they would have been during the following Tertiary, but also because the different continental configuration would have led to the development of an entirely different climatic regime. It was thus reasoned that: “Continents bunched in low latitudes near the equator, as Cretaceous continents tended to be, would allow warm ocean currents to carry heat poleward. High-latitude polar oceans, being less reflective than land, would also absorb more heat and further moderate climate.” Eric Barron and Warren Washington therefore decided to test this hypothesis by recreat- ing the Cretaceous climate through the use of a computer model.® Others followed suit.* There is no point in tracing the ups and downs of these various attempts and the disagreements between them. Suffice it to say that, in 1984, Kerr could safely state that",
