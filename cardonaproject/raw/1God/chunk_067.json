The “sun” of Creation, so claim the Sioux, appointed the north to be “the caretaker of this earth.”\"* More than that, at a time when “the sun did not move yet, did not rise and did not go down,” when it “just stood in one place,” the Creator “made the four seasons for the north to take care of...”'”",

        "main_text": "Chapter 19 Polar Wandering THE CORAL DATA edious as it may be to some, this chapter is included in order to forestall the objections that might be raised by those who see polar wandering through the wholesale shifting of Earth’s crust as a possible mechanism by which non-polar latitudes could have been driven into the Arctic regions. From the 1940s to the mid-1950s, for instance, Ting Ying Ma was involved in the study of corals which led him to declare that the position of the equator (and, therefore, also of the poles) had shifted from one geologic age to another.! What did these studies involve? Very much like trees, corals grow rings which are believed to indicate a cycle of seasonal growth; in winter, coral cells grow small and dense, whereas in summer they grow larger and more porous. Ma noticed that the rates of total annual growth in corals in identical, or simi- lar, species increased with proximity to the equator, while seasonal variation in growth rates increased with distances from the equator. This enabled him to correlate coral growth with latitude, which furnished him with a technique for investigating Earth’s ancient climates. It also led Ma to two related conclusions: (1) That seasonal change was clearly indicated in the oldest geologic periods, and (2) that the latitudinal temperatures of the past had been about the same as at present. If this is correct, a world without seasons, as proffered in the preced- ing chapter, could not have existed. What all of this conveyed to Ma was that, in the past, the position of the equator had changed from one geologic period to another and that none of these coincided with the pre- sent equatorial position of land. One of these earlier equators was even found to have bi- sected the Arctic Ocean. The mechanism for this displacement was then attributed to a sliding of the lithospheric shell over Earth’s liquid core, like the loose skin of an orange sliding around its fruit. Ma, however, could not match earlier equators in one hemisphere with corresponding ones for the same period on the opposite hemisphere in order to derive a complete circle. He therefore had to assume that continental drift was also involved and that it was this independent shift- ing of the continents which had thrown the ancient equators out of line. These combined displacements, of which Ma could deduce four separate events, were, according to him, sudden in execution and all in the same direction. He calculated them to have taken place during the last million years with the last readjustment having been com- pleted 65,000 to 2,800 years ago. Ma was as courageous in advocating continental drift as much as he was in proposing a wholesale shift of the lithosphere. Beginning as early as 1861, the theory of continental drift",

The theory was, however, disqualified in August of 1950 by the British Asso- ciation for the Advancement of Science for the simple reason that no mechanism could be found to account for the movements of the continents. It was then revived, thanks primarily to S. W. Carey, in March of 1958, at a symposium on the subject that was held at the Univer- sity of Tasmania. In the early 1960s, a cause was eventually tendered by Harry Hess who submitted that the upwelling of magma through immense rifts, or faults, in ocean bottoms was capable of carrying the “floating” continental plates with them as the magma spread to both sides of the rifts. The actual mechanism was to be found in the convection currents in- 392",

Where the spreading ocean bottom meets the edge of another conti- nental plate, it is subducted back into the interior, wrinkling the continental edge and uplift- ing it into mountain ranges in the process. The theory has now become dogma, proving sound Ma’s utilization of it at a time when it was still anathema to do so. On the other hand, the second half of Ma’s theory, concerning the wholesale shifting of earth’s lithosphere which, in any case, was the brainchild of Hugh Auchincloss Brown,” remained in dispute. Ma’s theory is thus left reliant on his coral evidence. How valid is this? First of all, as Thomas Stephenson warned in 1959, long after Ma had conducted his studies of corals, older accounts concerning the process of coral formation “should be read with reserve, since the ideas in vogue on this subject have until recently been largely specu- lative” and “too much based on the study of the skeleton.” “It is obvious that the skeleton is merely an imperfect if permanent record of the ac- tivities of the polyps, and study of the latter reveals the fact that in some cases at least conclusions as to the manner of growth, drawn from the skeleton, may be entirely er- roneous.”4 Granted that Stephenson was mainly concerned with the growth of coral reefs, the same can be said of older accounts pertaining to the growth of the polyps themselves, as indeed Stephenson makes clear when he refers to more recent studies by Matthai in relation to the formation of coral polyps.> Now it has long been known that corals are restricted to tropical and sub-tropical zones despite the fact that, in “certain past epochs,” coral reefs “had a far wider distribution than is now the case, their remains being plentiful in latitudes at which they cannot now maintain themselves.”° Thus, while Ma’s shifting latitudes could explain coral remains out of present tropical and sub-tropical climes, it has nothing to offer regarding their overall much wider distribution. The growth of corals requires an average annual water temperature of no less than 70° F. The polyps themselves, however, are insensitive to light. But “their endodermal tissues con- tain myriads of microscopic one-celled algae” which thrive “only in the presence of strong light.” This makes for a highly successful symbiotic relationship since “the corals rely on the algae to absorb their waste products.”? Thus, both warmth and strong light are necessary for the successful growth of corals and coral reefs. The biggest problem with Ma’s evidence, however, concerns the period of time repre- sented by a single coral reef which, at most, can be said to bridge a few thousand years, hardly enough to embrace a single geological period. Thus, for instance, as reported by Charles Hapgood: “At Pago Pago harbor borings were made down to the basalt underlying the reef, and after estimates of the growth rate were arrived at, the age of the reef (Utelei) was es- timated at 5,000 years. When these spans are compared with those of entire geologi- cal periods of the order of 20,000,000 or 30,000,000 years, it is clear how fragile must",
