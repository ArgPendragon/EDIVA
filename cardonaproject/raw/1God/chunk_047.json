        "bibliography": "THE ASTRONOMICAL DILEMMA Needless to say, our theory also demands an astronomical solution to the problem inher- ent in Saturn’s polar placement. As already noted, there are no bodies in the present Solar System which are linearly aligned. Worse than that, present Solar System theories, based on purely gravitational forces, do not seem to allow for celestial bodies so aligned. In the past, various authorities have attempted to scientifically account for, or discount, this polar align- ment® but, as of this writing, none of them have been able to encompass the totality of the model and/or the entire events dictated by the Saturnian scenario. This is not to be wondered at because the events in question have so far been scattered over an ever-growing array of piece-meal publications without much regard for their chronological order. Worse than that, not all of the events, with all their celestial interactions, and their consequential outcomes, have so far received treatment. Nor can the present work alleviate that particular problem ® See here especially, R. Ashton, “The Unworkable Polar Saturn,” AEON 1:3 (May 1988), pp. 39 ff.; F.

Before that can be attempted, however, we need to add a few more details to our scenario, even though it will tend to deepen the waters we have been wading in enough to cover our chin. 260",

Actually, the implication derived from the mytho-historical record is that there was a time when not even Saturn was yet quite visible. The record, for instance, hints at a time when the unseen god was still to emerge from an all-encompassing darkness. Mankind con- tinued to remember this as the time of beginnings, a time before Creation commenced. Thus the later compilers of the Rig Veda could philosophically state that, before there were any gods, there was neither “existent” nor “non-existent.”’ And yet there was something which was described in the same source as “that One Thing” and “this All.” As it is stated: “That One Thing, breathless, breathed by its own nature: apart from it was nothing whatsoever.”” And: “Darkness there was: at first concealed in darkness this All was indiscriminated chaos. All that existed then was void and formless.” As we shall soon see, this all-encompassing darkness is spoken of by the mythologies of almost all races. In fact, this milieu is stressed so often that one cannot help but assume that few situations impressed early man as much as this prolonged environmental state. And yet, in this darkness, up in the sky, there seems to have been something indistinct, the “void and formless” substance of the Rig Veda. TOHU WA BOHU As David Talbott noted from the very inception of his Saturnian studies, man described the creation of what has been termed “the earth” as if he had been an actual witness to it all. He was there when it happened and saw it all unveil with his very own eyes.‘ Some will counter that this was the natural outcome of man’s budding philosophical yearning. Looking around him, we are told, man would eventually have fallen upon the question of how every- thing had come to be. But, apart from the fact that the doctrine of beginnings was not univer- sally adhered to, why would all those races who believed in Creation have described it in",

        "main_text": "similar, if not near-identical, terms? The answer, of course, has to do with the fact that the mythic tales of Creation have always been misunderstood. Let us then continue to re-examine them. The father of all Creation myths, at least in the Western World, is that contained in the very first chapter of the Book of Genesis. It is there stated that: “In the beginning Elohim created the shemayim and ‘eretz. And ‘eretz was tohu wa bohu, and darkness was on the surface of the tehom. And the ruach of Elohim moved upon the face of the mayim.”* As we have already seen, Elohim was one of the ancient names of Saturn. Shemayim are “the heavens”—in the plural. Eretz is the word usually translated as “Earth,” but it more properly means “land.” The words tohu wa bohu are traditionally translated as “without form and void” or “void and empty.” The tehom is understood as a watery abyss—the deep. Ruach means “spirit” or “soul,” but also “wind,” while the mayim are merely “the waters” —also in the plural. What follows might offend those of a religious bent but, in a scholarly work, this cannot always be helped. Devoid of all religious significance, what the words of Genesis actually tell us is that, “in the beginning” —that is, as far back as man can remember—Saturn fash- ioned the “land”—which originally meant the land of the gods—which was formless and empty, while the “spirit,” or “wind,” of the same Saturn moved over the darkened waters. CHAOS Tohu wa bohu, however, can also mean “utter chaos.”° Thus, in the Phoenician cosmog- ony of Philo Byblius, we find “dark chaos” presiding as the ruling principle before Creation.’ It was no different among the ancient Greeks. In describing the Creation as remembered by his countrymen, Hesiod asks: “From the beginning, which first came to be?” And he an- swers: “Chaos was first of all...” ® Thus, according to Hesiod, in the beginning there was nothing but Chaos, “vast and dark.” This Chaos was surrounded by Night,'° which means surrounded by, or enveloped in, darkness. Guirand tells us that, among the Greeks, Chaos was “a pure cosmic principle devoid of god-like characteristics.”'' In this, however, he was simply falling prey to a later philosophic doctrine. Guirand also muddles the issue when he claims that “the first principle was Cronus, or Time, from which came Chaos, which symbolized the infinite...”!? It is obvious that, here,",

All of this reminds us of what Ovid had to say concerning the Creation as believed in by the Romans: “All nature was Chaos...Earth, Air, Water heaved and turned in darkness...” And this, in turn, leads us back to Janus who, as we have seen on a previous page, was also made to refer to himself as “Chaos.” It was said that when the elements of Creation separated, Chaos took on the form of Janus.‘ But since Janus was the same as Satur- nus/Kronos, what is indicated here is that this “Chaos” was Saturn itself or, to be more pre- cise, the element out of which Saturn was seen to emerge.'* TAO Likewise, the Chinese philosopher Lao-tzu (Lao-tse, Lao-tze) had it stated that: “There is something chaotic yet complete which existed before heaven and earth. Oh how still it is and formless, standing alone without changing, reaching everywhere without suffering harm. Its name I know not. To designate it I call it Tao.”\"® Or, in a different translation: “Before Heaven and Earth existed—There was something nebulous—Silent, iso- lated—Standing alone, changing not—Eternally revolving without fail—Worthy to be the Mother of All Things—I do not know its name—And address it as Tao.””” Notice the description of this entity as “something nebulous,” standing alone and “re- volving without fail.” As Lao Tzu claimed: “I do not know whose Son it is, an image of what existed before God.”'* In other words, this thing called Tao had no progenitors; it existed of its own, and did so before anything distinct that could have been termed God made its ap- pearance. Moreover, this thing called Tao was believed to be located “about the celestial pole which was considered to be the seat of power because all revolves about it.”!? This is the same locality in which the ancients insisted in placing the planet Saturn. More than that, the",
