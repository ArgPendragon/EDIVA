        "main_text": "David Leeming presented Hurakan as an aspect of the Feathered Serpent, % that is our old friend Quetzalcoatl. In the Popul Vuh, however, Hurakan and Feathered Serpent, there called Gucumatz, are presented as partners in Creation. Thus, while we view Gucu- matz/Quetzalcoatl as the embodiment of the Saturnian deity, it is obvious that Hurakan, while closely associated with proto-Saturn, was visualized as a separate entity. In a recent work, M. Preuss had half a mind to identify Hurakan, which name she ren- dered by the Spanish spelling “Jurakan,” with the constellation of Ursa Minor. This is in- teresting because Ursa Minor, the Little Bear, is the very northern constellation which con- tains the Pole Star, thus situating Hurakan in the very locality where the myths of other na- tions place the primeval north wind. Additionally, however, Preuss was astute enough to note the connection between this deity and the axis mundi,55 the term used by mythologists to de- note the boreal column said to have stretched between Earth and sky. Of additional importance is the fact that the name Hurakan translates as “One Leg”*°—which brings us to the next motif in our unfolding scenario. THE ONE-LEGGED GOD Among the ancient Egyptians, Osiris was said to have shone “above the Leg of heaven.” What this indicates is that this “Leg” appeared beneath the Saturnian orb, represented here as Osiris.57 We also note that, whatever this leg was, it had the appearance of fire. “Hail, Leg of fire,” was the manner in which it was invoked.*8 That this “Leg of fire” descended from Earth’s celestial north pole, the proto-Saturnian place par excellence, was cogently argued by Gerald Massey® and, as Talbott has shown, also by Hermann Kees.® It thus becomes appar- ent that this “Leg” stood for a support which stretched from beneath Saturn’s south pole to Earth’s north polar regions. In India we meet with the deity named Manu whose assimilation to the god Saturn had already been noticed in the 19th century by William Jones and G. S. Faber.°! That this identi- fication is correct is borne out by Manu’s epithet of Satyavrata, which is one of the many Sanskrit names for the planet Saturn.® Moreover, as Jacob Grimm indicated, Satyavrata is the Sanskrit equivalent of the Slavic Sitivrat, which is also a name for Saturn.® It is therefore noteworthy that Manu was said to have performed a severe penance which consisted of being “poised on one leg” for ten thousand years. It is also stated in the Upanishads, that Brahma, whom we have already seen identified as Saturn, “is only one-footed.”65",

        "main_text": "Presently a name for the Pole Star, we have also seen how Dhruva was placed in its posi- tion by Vishnu, the location of which he claimed to have been his in an earlier time. More than that, we have actually seen that Dhruva was originally one of Vishnu’s own epithets. The added interest here is that, very much like Manu, Dhruva was said to have maintained himself in intense meditation while standing upright on one foot. Furthermore, in Sanskrit, the word dhruva also means “post” and/or “stake”®? which, as Roger Ashton indicated, evi- dently stood for “a celestial support.” In the Maitri Upanishad, Vishnu himself is referred to as “All-supporting.”©° Another epithet of Vishnu is Yamakila, derived from Yama, one of the Sanskrit names for Saturn, plus the suffix kilah, meaning “post” and or “pillar.”7° Yet another epithet of Vishnu was Ekapada, from Ekapad, which means one-footed.7! Under this archaic epithet, sometimes rendered Aja Ekapad, Vishnu is referred to as the one footed support of the Cosmos?? and “the Birthless One-footed One.””3 This is in keeping with our theory that the divine Leg un- der consideration must have been a physical substance that had the appearance of a columnar support. But also, being “birthless” presupposes an existence beyond memory. In other words, this celestial support, stretching between Saturn and Earth, seems to have always been",

        "main_text": "there as, in fact, Genesis implies in connection with the ruach which has led us to this disclo- sure. Other epithets of Saturn in Sanskrit literature are Pangu, signifying a lame person,”4 and Shirnapada, meaning “withered foot.”75 Perhaps the most well-known Sanskrit name for the planet Saturn is Shani (or Sani).76 And while Shani is not described as having been one legged, he is nonetheless said to have been lame.7” As Talbott has noted: “The Celtic Sol [so named by the Romans] stood on one foot all day. The African Wachoga tell of the old god Mrule who...had only one leg...Russian myth presents the demonic Verlioka as a...one-legged figure. So also was the Chinese primeval god K’uei one-footed.”78 One even finds this one-legged god among the Australian Aborigines, where he is re- membered as Turunbulun.7? One word of caution: There are other deities said to have possessed a single leg or foot who do not translate as personifications of the planet Saturn, prime among whom is the Mesoamerican Tezcatlipoca. But that, too, is a related topic that must await a future volume. THE PHALLIC POST In the year 2000, while exploring the Neolithic remains at the Nakovana cave near Du- brovnik on Croatia’s Dalmatian Coast, Tim Kaiser and Staso Forenbaher made a revealing discovery. Having come across a barrier to the cave, first thought to be a natural rock fall, but later disclosed as having been man made, they penetrated beyond it to three natural cham- bers. Various shards of pottery, some dating to 6000 B. C., were found scattered all over the floors of these chambers. The central room, however, contained a two-foot high stalagmite, “unmistakably phallic in shape.” Examination of this stalagmite showed that it had actually been formed in another part of the cave from where it was detached and moved to the central cubicle. Near the stalagmite was a trough covered with limestone slabs, which is thought to have served as a bench, running the entire width of the cave. A three-foot deep pit was also found nearby.®° All of this marks the cave as having been a cult center devoted to the wor- ship of the phallus. Natural formations of similar resemblance have long attracted the attention of primitive societies as well as members of civilized races. One such phallic rock, an artificially en- hanced natural formation, and now a prominent stop for tourists, is Kauleonanahoa, in the forest above the Kalaupapa Cliffs, on the Hawaiian island of Molokai. It has, of course, long been known that phallic worship was an institution that stretches back into the mist of time. In certain parts of the world, especially in India, it continues to",

One found in a Neolithic temple on Malta, the island of my birth, and now housed in the ar- chaeological museum in Valletta, reproduces the phallus in triplicate form. Triplicate phallic images were also found at Alatri and on the Pelasgic walls at Grottatore.8! Until recently, Western sentiments, especially those harbored by Judeo-Christian faiths, had long been shocked by the veneration of the male reproductive organ. This is so true that, in 1891, a Hindu boy was flogged in Madras, India, by order of the British Police Magistrate “for exhibiting an indecent figure in public view.”82 As Count Eugene Goblet d’Alviella re- counted: “What he had explicitly done was to set up, in accordance with universal custom, a phallic image before a house that was in the course of erection... The image was in- deed set up before [the house] as a symbol of the Deity...”",

        "main_text": "Those of Western religious sentiment would be even more shocked to learn that the Hebrew El, the very same god who, under the name Elohim, is believed to have created the world, was said to have been equipped with a long penis. What was this sacred virile member attached to god? Among the Egyptians, the phallus of Ra was highly honored. This is indicated in the praises glorifying the god. As it was written: “Who is this?” And the answer is given: “It is Osiris.” But, as an alternative, which, in this case, as in many others, boils down to the same thing, the passage continues with: “Others, however, say that his name is Ra, and that the god who dwelleth in Amentet is the phallus of Ra, wherewith he had union with himself.”85 The most popular ithyphallic god of Egypt was Min. Unfortunately, despite Ev Coch- rane’s attempt to identify this deity as a personification of Saturn® and, later, through a change of mind, as a personification of Mars, 87 not enough is known about this deity to reach a definite conclusion concerning his genesis. Although at this point, as noted above, the inclusion of Shu would be out of chronologi- cal sequence, it is interesting to note that this god was inter alia lauded as “Lord of the Phal- lus.”88 In the Pyramid Texts, he is actually equated with the male organ of Atum.8° What is even more revealing, however, is the fact that, in some depictions, the heaven-sustaining Shu is replaced with the phallus of Geb. It is then evident that the phallus of the deity was itself believed to have acted as the support of heaven much in the same manner that the single leg of the god did. As Diodorus reported, it was not only the Egyptians who consecrated “that member” in their initiatory rites, but quite a few other nations.” And, as a more modern authority noted: “The antiquity of the phallus as an amulet is shown by the number found among Egyptian sculptures. No visitor to Egyptian antiquities needs to be told this...The phallus was the most sacred amulet worn by the vestal virgins of ancient Rome. Moreover, we find that Sesostris of the early twelfth dynasty, who conquered Asia, set up memorials of a phallic nature among the people who had acted bravely...In the ruins of Zimbabwe, in Central Africa, are to be seen phalli carved upon stone, similar to those found in Sardinia, which are said to be Phoenician...Again, numbers of phallic amulets in bronze are found in the earliest Etruscan tombs...”°! Mythologists have always assumed that phallic worship arose out of the ancients’ recog- nition of the male member as a generative organ, and thus worthy of sacred honor as a sym- bol of fertility. Nor is this entirely a modern view, as evidenced by the writings of Dio- dorus.%2 That this is a logical assumption there is no need to tell. As an example, the lower part of a statue of Dionysos, at Phigaleia, was covered with leaves of bay and ivy. Arthur Cook surmised that this was “possibly” done in order to conceal the god’s erect phallus and",
