(It has always fascinated me that such extraterrestri- als would have bestowed such astronomical knowledge to the ancestors of the Dogon, knowledge which was of no practical use to them, while giving them nothing that might have alleviated the precarious living of their Stone Age primitiveness.) Others would rather have the Dogon educated in these matters by other sorts of visiting aliens—Christian missionaries from the West. The missionary campaign in tropical Africa, however, did not commence in earnest until the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century. But this is neither here nor there because, to be sure, the Sudan, including Mali, had much earlier come under the influence of Islam, so that no Christian influence could have pene- trated the region—and this despite the fact that the rural areas, such as the one occupied by the Dogon, continued to stick to their traditional animistic ways.®! And, in any case, would missionaries, Christian or otherwise, bent on converting primitive peoples to their faith, have filled the minds of these natives with astronomical knowledge? Or why was this knowledge, as adhered to by these natives, first reported to the outside world by missionaries who were as confounded by the knowledge as were later astronomers? One other alternative that has been proposed is that the ancestors of the Dogon had been in possession of optical instruments. However, even Galileo, with his pioneering telescope, was not able to see Saturn as a ringed orb. In fact, the image of Saturn that he was capable of resolving through his optical instrument was so vague that he mistook the planet for three separate bodies. As he himself reported: “I have observed with great admiration that Saturn is not a single star but three to- gether, which, as it were, touch each other...the middle being much larger than the lateral ones...by employing a glass which multiplies the superficies [i.e., visible boundaries] more than a thousand times, the three globes will be seen very distinctly and almost touching, with only a small dark space between them.” & It was not until 1655 that Christian Huygens, with a better instrument, was able to report (through his now famous encoded message) that Saturn was actually “girdled by a thin flat ring, nowhere touching, inclined to the ecliptic.” Is it then probable that the Dogon, who are still living in their primitive mud huts as I write this, could have been in possession of a better telescope than the one utilized by Gali- leo? THE STAR OF NINE MOONS The Efe Pygmies of the Ituri Forest in the eastern portion of Africa’s Congo basin in what is now Upper Zaire have been unceremoniously relegated by most anthropologists to the lowest rungs of human evolution.

If ever there was a people who did not need any knowledge of the stars, or who, even if they did, would have been encumbered by their environment in properly observing the twinkling deni- zens of the night sky, it surely must have been these Pygmies. Of horizons, so cru- cial to astronomical observations, they could see nothing. And yet, hampered as they are by their encroaching jungle, they possess “some rather remarkable knowledge of the planets and constella- tions” which they continue to observe “with the keenest interest.” © As with the Dogon, of special inter- est to us in this work is the Efe Pygmy knowledge concerning the planet Saturn. There are intimations that, like the Dogon, their ancestors were also aware at first mistook them for two adjoining bodies. that this planet is surrounded by a ring. (illustration by Charles Hogarth.) They definitely hold the belief that Sat- urn is surrounded by satellites. Up until the end of the nineteenth century, Saturn was known to possess only eight satellites. Phoebe, the ninth satellite of Saturn, was discov- ered by W. H. Pickering in 1899. No further Saturnian satellites were discovered until the dawn of the space age. In the views of Earth-based telescopes, only nine of Saturn’s satellites are visible. And yet, the Efe Pygmies “traditionally define the planet Saturn as ‘the star of nine moons’.”67 Their name for the planet—Bibi Tiba Abutsiua’ani—means exactly that: The Star of Nine Moons.® They also call it Bibi Deba—“The good or perfect star.” 6 Jean-Pierre Hallet, of course, is of the belief that the Efe Pygmies had not always occu- pied the land they do at present. “According to Pygmy legends,” he wrote, “the ancient Pyg- mies smelted and worked metals, dwelled in ‘great villages’ or cities, practiced agriculture and animal husbandry, sailed about in boats, manufactured pottery, and in general lived on an exceedingly high level of material technology.””° None of this has ever been verified by",

But even if there is a grain of truth in these legends, it still would not have enabled the Efe Pygmies, or their ancestors, to see the satellites surrounding the planet Saturn. So where did that information come from? When all is said and done, the only other alternative left to explain the Dogon and Efe Pygmy knowledge of Saturn’s ring structure and its satellites is that their ancestors had, in a far off time, been able to view the planet at closer proximity—which would mean that, somehow, Earth had been much closer to Saturn than it is at present. As outlandish as this idea may appear, there seems to be no other resolution to the problem—which brings to mind the oft-repeated words of Arthur Conan Doyle: “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, has to be the truth.”7! Besides, as forthcoming chapters will indicate, everything else that our ancient forefathers had to say about this planet continues to strengthen the supposition. THIRD INTERLUDE Science has forgotten Oskar Reichenbach who, as far back as 1884, had proposed a the- ory purporting to prove that land masses on Earth have rifted and moved northward.” His ideas can therefore be said to have preceded the similar ones of Alfred Wegener, himself rel- egated to a footnote in the annals of science as the originator of the Continental Drift Theory, by some 33 years. But, more than that, Reichenbach was of the belief that, in the past, the So- lar System had experienced a series of catastrophic events.”? Basing his conclusions on the imperfect knowledge of his time, he had also formulated certain theories concerning the planet Saturn. As wrong as he might have been, and I am not here concemed with defending Reichenbach, he hit on the novel idea that Earth is “an offspring of Saturn,”74 by which he meant to imply that Earth had once been a satellite of the giant gas planet. Whether Immanuel Velikovsky was aware of Reichenbach’s wild theory or not must remain a moot question but, many years later, he, too, came to the same conclusion. Origi- nally, Velikovsky’s Worlds in Collision contained a section on Saturn concerning events that predated the ones he described in that work. For various reasons, he was then advised to ex-",

At one time, because of the manner in which he was treated by academia, Velikovsky threatened to take his Saturnian thesis with him to the grave but, as matters turned out, reason prevailed and he was able to expand and finalize his hypothesis under the title of Saturn and the Flood and Jupiter of the Thunderbolt, a title which was later changed to In the Beginning. As of this writing, this work still has to see the light of day. In 1971, however, Velikovsky gave a lecture at the University of the New World in Valais, Switzerland, in which he presented a synopsis of his unpublished Saturnian scenario. Among the items he disclosed there was the hypothesis that Earth might once have been a satellite of Saturn.7> The lecture was later transcribed by Jan Sammer and appeared as an ar- ticle in KRONOS.7© Independent of Velikovsky, but basing their work on his as also on the mytho-historical record, Harold Tresman and Bernard Newgrosh (writing under the name of Brendan O’Gheoghan), also came to the conclusion that Earth must once have orbited Saturn as a satellite,”’ a topic to which Tresman was later to return.78 In analyzing the ambiguous, but tantalizing, planetary system proposed by Philolaos, the Pythagorean philosopher from Southern Italy who lived in the time of Socrates, Lynn Rose came to the same conclusion. Although this system of Philolaos had long been relegated to the library of Classical curiosities, Rose was able to recapture what it might have once in- tended to portray. Although what resulted was a Saturnian scenario the details of which are at variance with the one being presented here, it still contains some of its basic elements. As Rose explained: “According to the conventional interpretation, the system of Philolaos had Earth in orbit around a Central Fire...”79 Since the Sun was described as orbiting this Central Fire®° it becomes obvious that the Central Fire could not have been the Sun. An in-depth study of this system, together with his privileged knowledge of Velikovsky’s unpublished work on the subject, enabled Rose to conclude that this Central Fire was Saturn shining as a “sun,” and that Earth was in those days in orbit around it.! Combining Velikovsky’s postulate with that of David Talbott and others, Frederick Hall embraced the same idea, presenting it in a speculative scenario concerning the history of the Solar System.®2 Certain fundamentals, based on specific proposals offered by others, are here accepted, but also tested against the record. The hypothesis that Earth had once been a satellite of Sat- urn, which originally came to this author via Velikovsky, is one of them. Additional research conducted independently by the present author has led to the same conclusion. This research has however made it apparent that prehistoric man, ignorant of astronomical matters, would not have been able to deduce that his world was a satellite of another planet. But, being close enough to Saturn, he would have been able to view that planet as something much bigger than the present pin-point of light we see in the night sky. Saturn, in fact, would have loomed large in the sky as a disk, or sphere, much larger than that of the present full Moon. And this",

This makes us better understand why Janus/Saturnus was made to state that, prior to Creation, he appeared as “a mere ball,” a claim also made for the Eskimo deity Ataksak who was said to look “like a sphere.” It also explains why the symbol of Shamash, identified as the planet Saturn by the Assyro-Babylonians themselves, was represented as a sun-like disk. So, likewise, with the disc-symbol representing Ra, whom we have also seen identified as Saturn, although in a less elaborate manner. It definitely explains the beliefs of the Dogon of Mali, as also those of the Efe pygmies of the Ituri forest. This, then, together with its radiating brightness , better explains why Saturn was consid- ered to have been the most prominent among the planets—which provides us with our next numbered hypothesis. But, rather than numbering this as Hypothesis #3, I would like to num- ber it #1, while reshuffling our previous two hypotheses. What we have at this point then is the following: Hypothesis #1: That, from what can be deduced from ancient as well as primitive astron- omical lore, Earth had one been a satellite of the planet Saturn which, because of its proxim- ity, loomed large in the sky as a distinct disc larger than the size of the full Moon. Hypothesis #2: That, according to the ancients, the planet Saturn once shone as a sun. Hypothesis #3: That, still according to the ancients, this primitive Saturnian sun shone during that time we today call the night. But does astronomy, as presently believed in, allow for this state of affairs? 178",
