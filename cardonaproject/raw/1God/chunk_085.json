        "main_text": "And then, harping back to the ambiguities of plasma science as it exists at present, are jets really jets? In other words, are they really jettisoned material? There does not seem to be a consensus concerning the answer to this most important question. Beginning with the sug- gestion of W. Baade and R. Minkowski in 1954, astrophysicists have assumed that astral jets constitute the actual ejections of matter.27 But, as Don Scott more recently noted: “We should not infer too much when we see the word ‘jet’ used (especially by as- tronomers). A columnar plasma can /ook like a jet. But these jets are not jet engine exhausts—they are not massive flows of material. There may not be much stuff flowing in the jet—except for an electric current. The ‘stuff’ may be getting squeezed while remaining relatively stationary within the ‘jet’.”°8 Or, to quote Peratt, who himself uses the word “jet” in relation to these astral emanations throughout his 1992 opus: “Good as ‘jets’ are, [they] are not really jets. They are perceived as ‘jets’ of gas by astronomers and jets of gas do exist. But gas jets do not have the radiation properties, not even the features, of what we observe in space. “Jets also do not exist in plasma (charged particle beams) except when a very strong magnetic field is there to keep it from immediately flaring out...The term ‘jet’ is very popular and convenient if physically incorrect.”?9 Which brings us back to Andrew Gray’s “electric discharge” hanging out in space with- out dissipating, to say nothing of Thornhill’s own sustained plasma discharge. Another objection that Thornhill raised is that “being enveloped in a plasma vortex would not be conducive to pleasant living conditions”3° since this would have placed the entire Earth within the vortex of a world-wide tornado.3! And, to be sure, while astral jets are rela- tively slim or narrow in close proximity to the stars that spawn them, they tend to fan out farther away, “reaching a diameter wider than the orbit of Pluto.”22 But this, again, is merely a matter of scale. Thus when we look at HH 34 we see quite distinctly that the width of the jet is not as wide as the diameters of the knots embedded within it. This is even more evident in HH 409, the jet emitted by HD 163296. These two systems show quite clearly that the widths of astral jets fall short of the diameters of the knots. In fact it is quite obvious that, were these knots to be thought of as planets, the jets would only encompass their polar areas, very much as posited for proto-Saturn’s polar column in relation to Earth. Thornhill is also of the opinion that had Earth really been suspended within an astral jet emanating from proto-Saturn, all of terrestrial life would have been electrocuted.*? In view of the number of deaths of people reported to have been struck by that plasma discharge known to us as lightning, Thornhill’s concern is understandable. This author was himself, at the age of twelve, blown off his feet by a lightning discharge. Fortunately it was not a direct hit. Di- rect hits by lightning discharges on persons who managed to escape with their life are not, on",

But, as Don Scott felt moved to clarify, this would only have ensued at ground zero and could never have applied to Earth’s entire population.*4 Thornhill disagreed, stating that, as the voltage rises, “the plasma would extend to lower latitudes until the entire surface of the planet was covered.”> He did not, however, provide an electrical justification concerning why the jet’s voltage should rise. And then, again, we run headlong into Thornhill’s belief that proto-Saturn’s polar column was a sustained plasma discharge in the form of Birkeland current. Why, then, would this sustained plasma discharge not be subject to a similar, if not identical, rise in voltage? One of Thornhill’s greatest objections has to do with the force that would have kept Earth aligned with proto-Saturn’s rotational axis, which brings us full circle to the problem we started with. As he had it stated: “No one has shown how massive planets can be simply sus- pended above the pole of a star while enveloped in a plasma discharge.”3° And: “Most of the planets so far discovered [in extra-solar systems] are gas giants that oc- cupy normal [that is equatorial] orbits close to their stellar parents. They are not sus- pended in polar stellar jets.”37 “If [what Cardona claims was] the normal mode of planet formation we should not expect to find planets around nearby stars by looking for the stellar wobble caused by normal orbits.” 38 But, for one thing, no one is advocating that planets can only be formed through poleward ejection. If Arp is correct in that some galaxies are ejected from other galaxies in a lateral di- rection, the same may probably be true for the ejection of some stars and planets. And then, also, no one is proclaiming that planets ejected in poleward direction must remain forever stacked. Obviously, the Saturnian system itself eventually relaxed into equatorial orbits once it entered the domain of the Sun. Meanwhile, because of their very lack of equatorial orbital motion, any extra-solar planets suspended in polar jets would not cause stellar wobble, and would thus be among the most difficult celestial objects capable of being detected. Thornhill claims that “there would need to be a persistent force to keep the planets sus- pended above a stellar pole.”3? In discussing the E galaxies aligned along the jet of M87, Arp, too, found reason to ask an identical question: “Why had not these older galaxies drifted off this alignment into the general field in all this time?” But as he himself recognized, “be- ing ejected along the minor axis [that is the axis of rotation] they have no angular momentum and simply remain along their original ejection direction.”# This applies just as well to our hypothesized situation because, out in space, there would have been no nearby bodies that would have tended to exert their attractive influence on proto-Saturn and its entou- rage—which is one additional reason demanding that the proto-Saturnian system would originally have been a free-floating sub-brown dwarf system outside our Solar System.",

        "main_text": "To be sure, Thornhill is not opposed to the contention that planets are ejected from brown dwarf stars. As he has stated: “Brown dwarfs are constitutionally and energetically best suited to produce rocky planets and moons.”4! Neither is he adverse to the claim that proto- Saturn itself ejected planets which are now members of our Solar System, together with our own Earth,” precisely as postulated in the present thesis. Exactly in what, then, does he dif- fer from us? One of the main reasons behind Thornhill’s list of objections enumerated above becomes apparent when he compares proto-Saturn’s characteristics to Jupiter’s magneto- sphere. As he explained: “The polar column can then be imagined as having been equivalent to a hyperactive magnetospheric display of a size exceeding that of Jupiter’s in which the Birkeland currents were visible. Remember that Jupiter’s ‘tail’ stretches invisibly for half a bil- lion km to the orbit of Saturn.”43 Jupiter’s “magnetospheric display,” which stretches into its billion km “tail,” is however equatorially wrapped around the giant planet. It is not a polar, or bipolar, emission. And this is precisely Thornhill’s point because, as far as he is concerned, the planets were ejected from proto-Saturn in a lateral, or equatorial, direction. As we have seen, according to Thorn- hill, only on entry into the Solar System would the planets have aligned themselves in a lin- ear configuration as proto-Saturn dragged its entourage behind it much in the manner of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. Thus, still according to him, “we are talking simply about a linear arrangement of bodies where the only force between them is attractive.” This would then conform with Talbott’s contention that Earth had originally orbited proto-Saturn in a phase- locked equatorial orbit, concerning which no evidence was ever produced from the mytho- historical record, and against which enough objections have already been raised in the past pages of this work. Within the confines of Thornhill’s scenario, it then becomes evident that proto-Saturn’s polar column would also have come into being after proto-Saturn and its entourage invaded the Solar System. And it is this scenario that precludes him from accepting the pre-existence of proto-Saturn’s polar column.‘ But, as Peratt stated on the strength of his plasma studies, “the column is the configuration out of which planets form so it should always have been there.” Thus, when I brought it to Peratt’s attention that, according to the mytho-historical record, proto-Saturn’s polar column was one of two items—the other being the celestial wa- ters—which was never seen as having been created, he reaffirmed both our positions by as- serting that there is much quantitative evidence that tends to support this.47 Granted that we have been discussing emissions of vastly different amplitudes, might we not, after all, be embroiling ourselves in nomenclature? One thing we have surely learned is that the demarcation between stars, red dwarf stars, brown dwarf stars, sub-brown dwarf stars, and giant gaseous planets is simply one of magnitude. We have also been discussing knots, condensations, plasmoids, and planetisimals “imbedded” in astral “jets” when, in fact, these are terms that connote the same phenomena even if, perhaps, at different stages of",

Or where is the demarcation be- tween the members in this last class of objects? Other than amplitude, might we not be inad- vertently referring to the same, or associated, phenomena? Thus, when it comes to proto-Sat- urn’s polar column, is it the term “jet” that Thornhill really objects to? Did he not, originally, himself refer to it as a “jet”? Would he rather that I refer to it as a sustained Birkeland cur- rent? Have I not referred to it as such? Does he not himself believe it to have been exactly that? Does not Moss’ suggested remnant of a jet come close to filling the bill? Call it what you will, this cosmic emission, or sustentation, with or without the participation of a Rankine vortex, would have been the whirling ray of light from above which ancient man remem- bered as the single leg or phallus of the Saturnian deity, that axis of fire which he saw stretching down as a swath of light from the polar planet he venerated as his god. AN ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTION Thornhill’s other objections, as enumerated above, must not necessarily be judged as be- ing invalid. My reluctance in accepting his convictions notwithstanding, he might yet turn out to be correct in some of his opposing contentions. While I feel confident in my own views, I will not be adamant about their acceptance. My honest opinion is that both his claims and mine, to say nothing of David Talbott’s, should remain open to further investiga- tion until our presently opposing beliefs can be reconciled through further developments, and a better understanding, of plasma cosmology. Additionally, and to be fair, while the use of Halton Arp’s data, as utilized in this work, seems to imply his endorsement of the Saturn thesis, I must confess that nothing can be fur- ther from the truth. On the contrary, as he has made clear to me: “,..the biggest difficulty I see with matching the Saturnist interpretation of the his- torical records is the very long time scales needed for dynamical and material evolu- tion. Also I wonder how much the record reflects the world picture of the [ancient] priests who can be very illusionary and how much it represented the practical obser- vations of the citizens tilling the fields. Your point about independent myths agreeing across time and culture is the point that impresses me the most. But then I think of the unfortunate situation today when experts disagree totally when looking at the same replicable [astronomical] photograph.”48 There is, however, nothing in the present volume that contradicts the posited time scales required by the evolution of celestial bodies. No date for the origin of Earth—or proto-Sat- urn, for that matter—has been proposed, and no date, or age, shall be. Neither will I offer anything concerning what Arp calls “the unfortunate situation today” concerning expert dis- agreement on any subject. As for the consistency of the mytho-historical record itself, enough has been presented in these past pages (with much more yet to come in hopeful future volumes). Arp, of course, is not yet well acquainted with this record, having only come in contact with the Saturn thesis during one single conference sponsored by KRONIA Communications, which was held in Portland, Oregon, in September of 2000. This is not to say that he will necessarily accept the thesis, either in part or in its entirety, once he acquaints himself with the evidence in its favor. My only hope is that if he ever gets to read this work, he will at least consider it.",

        "main_text": "It is a somewhat different matter when it comes to Anthony Peratt who had also first come in contact with the Saturn thesis at the same world conference attended by Arp. While not entirely convinced during the conference, he soon showed interest right after the event through personal communications with David Talbott and Wallace Thornhill. Thus, during the proceedings of the KRONIA conference, held in Laughlin, Nevada, in July of the fol- lowing year, he had no qualms in stating that, because of scaled-up Birkeland currents, he was not surprised to hear of the Saturnian configuration or its attendant polar column.*? As Thornhill later reported: “According to Peratt, the recognized authority on the subject, the plasma behaviour fits the detailed representations of the polar column perfectly. I am aware of the com- plexities of plasma discharge instabilities and am satisfied with Peratt’s subsequent identification of the polar column with that phenomenon. The ‘Peratt instabilities,’ as they are now known, turn out to be far more complex than any of us could have imagined and therefore form an unbeatable test of the polar configuration model.” ° What led Peratt to seriously consider the Saturnian, or polar, configuration theory was his own first-hand experience with plasma experiments at the Los Alamos National Laboratories, New Mexico. To begin with, having served as Alfvén’s secretariat, he was quite familiar with the latter’s theories. Thus, during a lecture given at one of Alfvén’s “New Astronomy” seminars at the University of California, San Diego—circa 1980-1981 — Alfvén had proposed that cosmic objects form in columns,°>! very much in the manner being here propounded. As Peratt later clarified, plasmoids are produced in an electrical discharge.>? And: “Plasma cosmogony, via Alfvén, provides the physics for the evolution of the plas- moids into planetisimals and eventually planets. These form like beads on a string.” 3 It might be argued that one planet suspended beneath another, or beneath a sub-brown dwarf, can hardly be compared to “beads on a string.” However, as those who are already familiar with the Saturnian configuration theory know, and as will be disclosed in future se- quels to this work, there were other planets besides Earth that were involved in the configu- ration in question. Even so, when questioned on the possibility of brown dwarf stars ejecting jets, Peratt’s answer echoed Thornhill’s with a resounding “no.”4 How, then, can this be compatible with his assertion that cosmic bodies form in columns like beads on a string? To begin with, plasma experiments have convinced Peratt that planets and their satellites can form entirely independent of any star.55 If nothing else, this would eliminate the neces- sity of searching for proto-Saturn’s parent, a search that, even if one existed, would certainly prove futile in any case. But the question that this raises is: How, then, would strings of plan- ets form? The answer to this takes us back into Alfvén’s domain, concerning whom Peratt had this to say:",
