        "main_text": "Chapter 1 MYTH he first criticism that will be leveled at this work is that it is based on nothing but myths and legends. I agree: it is. It is also based on recent discoveries in astronomy, geology, and palaeontology. Even so, what are myths and legends? Strictly speaking, legends are traditional tales popularly regarded as historical myths. But then what are myths? Myths are usually defined as primitive, or ancient, tales involving su- pernatural beings, often embodying once-popular ideas concerning natural and historical phenomena. What, then, is the difference between myths and legends? There will be some who will claim that there is no difference. Others may make a distinction between mythic tales told about historical persons (legends) and mythic tales told about divine and semi-divine beings (mythology). Personally, I would make a further distinction in that mythology deals mostly with cosmogonical origins. But let us not get caught up in semantics. Let me simply say that, in this work, I shall be concentrating on those tales dealing with divine and semi-divine beings. One claim I shall, however, be making is that these tales are not mythic in the usually understood sense of the word. In other words, what I shall be claiming is that the tales I shall be treating of are not to be considered untrue. On the contrary, I hope to show beyond a reas- onable doubt that these tales truly reflect events that, bizarre though they might seem, actu- ally transpired in ages past. Franz Xavier Kugler, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on Babylonian and Biblical astronomy, chronology, and mythology, who died in 1929, warned that: \u201c...ancient traditions, even when they are dressed as myth and saga, cannot be dismissed lightly as fantastic, or worse, meaningless fabrications. It is particularly proper to avoid this pitfall when dealing with serious reports, especially those of a religious nature such as those that occur in large number in the Old Testament.\u201d' In this work, the word \u201cmythology\u201d is used in its original Greek meaning\u2014 mytholo- gia, from muthos or mythos, as pronounced by the Athenians, meaning \u201ctale,\u201d and logia, de- rived from legein (to speak): that is, the telling of tales. There is nothing in the Greek term it- self which specifies that these tales were considered fictional. More than that, it were these very tales that formed the basis of Greek and other religions of the ancient world. True, it shall be countered that these ancient religions were based on false premises. What I aim to indicate, on the other hand, is that these premises were anything but false.",

As Roger Wescott explained, lin- guistic comparison suggests that the Greek word muthos is derived from a Proto-Indo-Euro- pean stem which means \u201cto remember nostalgically,\u201d and/or \u201cto pine for.\u201d* And, as I shall also endeavor to show, the contents of the world\u2019s mythology indicates exactly that\u2014a sorrowful longing for the conditions of a past age. Thus Wescott was inclined to state that he viewed myth \u201cas more wistful than wishful\u201d besides being \u201cmore commemorative than imaginative.\u201d? Those who are familiar with the contents of myth, even if only cursorily, will at once point out that myths are too convoluted in their bewildering messages, when not perplexingly contradictory, to be taken seriously in this day and age. But, as Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss admon- ished, \u201cthis apparent arbitrariness is belied by the astounding similarity among myths col- lected in widely different regions.\u201d* Or, as Wescott succinctly phrased it: \u201cMyths are at once startlingly bizarre and oppressively repetitious.\u201d* For Alan Watts, the prime paradox was that myth conceals while it simultaneously reveals.\u00b0 RITUAL The systematic study of myth could be said to have been inaugurated no earlier than the 6th century B.C.,\u2019 but it has continued unabated ever since. Myth, in its turn, is inexorably bound to ritual, so much so that a particular school of thought has long argued that myth is derived from ritual.* This view holds that myths originated as textual commentaries meant to explain and justify the rites. As James Frazer noted: \u201cNo people ever observed a custom be- cause a mythical being was said to have once acted in a certain way.\u201d\u00b0 And as long as the stress is on \u201cmythical being,\u201d | heartily agree. 1 cannot, however, agree with him when he maintains that \u201call peoples have invented myths to explain why they observed certain cus- toms\u201d \u00b0\u2014especially since this begs the question as to why customs arose in the first place. A particular myth, according to Frazer, \u201cis never so graphic and precise in its details as when it is a simple transcript of a ceremony which the author of the myth witnessed with his eyes.\u201d\" \u201cFor while many cases can be shown in which a myth has been invented to explain a rite [Frazer had it stated], it would be hard to point to a single case in which a myth has given rise to a rite. Ritual may be the parent of myth, but can never be its child.\u201d\u201d",

        "main_text": "There might be some who might view this as a case of placing the cart before the horse, claiming that the contrary is certainly true, that, in actual fact, ceremonial rituals arose as an attempt to graphically illustrate the events narrated by myth. Wescott, citing Edward Tylor and L\u00e9vi-Strauss, definitely saw this reverse as being Just as possible\u2014that rites could have arisen \u201cas mere dramatizations of preexisting myths.\u201d \u201d Frazer himself not only knew this but referred his readers to H. Usener whose views were in direct opposition to his own.\" But, as Clyde Kluckhohn was forced to conclude, the problem as to which came first, ritual or myth, is one that is not likely to be solved.\" Thus, while I cannot agree with Frazer\u2019s view, neither can I agree that the opposite is true. To begin with, I do not believe that myths owe their existence to an author\u2014at least not if we are speaking of the origin of any one particular myth. Myths, as I intend to illustrate, arose as eye-witness accounts of what was actually seen and, in that sense, no author need be invoked. Likewise also with custom, ritual, and religious ceremonies: They all owed their in- spiration to actual events which the participants attempted to recreate for purposes much more sublime than Frazer ever imagined.\" My own position is that myth and ritual rose together hand-in-hand in a united effort to perpetuate, rather than explain, what had once taken place in the ancient sky, and to com- memorate those events. DRAMA In ancient Greece, myth was not only associated with ritual but also with that form of entertainment that has come down to us as drama. What is interesting about Greek drama, and not widely known, is that the art originated in the rituals dedicated to one particular de- ity, namely Dionysus. As Gilbert Murray observed, according to the testimony of the Greeks themselves, tragedy was explicitly concerned with the \u201csufferings of Dionysus.\u201d In fact, when dissatisfied with any particular play, the Athenians were wont to exclaim that \u201cit has nothing to do with Dionysus.\u201d * \u201cGreek tragedy, strictly speaking, was a peculiar form of art with narrow limits, both local and temporary. It was, in literal meaning, a \u2018goat-song,\u2019 i.e., a molpe (dance and song combined), performed at the altar of Dionysus over the sacrifice of a dismem- bered goat, which, by a form of symbolism common in ancient religion, represented the god himself. Hardly acted outside one small district of Greece, lasting as a living form not much beyond the limits of the fifth century B.C., performed only at one par- ticular type of religious festival, the Dionysia at Athens.\u201d\u201d\u201d True, a certain amount of criticism can be leveled at the above. After all, Dionysus was not himself the usual subject of Greek drama\u2014at least not that we can tell from the various Greek plays that have come down to us\u2014since he only appears in a couple of plays.

As Peter James pointed out, the real subject of all Greek plays was \u201cgood drama\u2014the same criterion used by Shakespeare and the rest.\u201d\u201d \u201cOf course Greek drama drew on religious, legendary and historical themes\u2014these formed the moral backbone of Greek society, from which the great dramas were crea- ted. (Same as Shakespeare, who drew on local British traditions as well as Scandinav- ian, Greek, Roman and Italian.) It does not mean that Greek drama somehow \u2018evolved\u2019 from religious ritual, though this is commonly supposed.\u201d As James also pointed out: \u201cThe ancient Greeks of the Sth century were much like us\u2014they liked a good drink, a laugh and good drama.\u201d\u201d One can argue, as James has,\u201d against Murray\u2019s statements concerning the acting out of Greek drama as having taken place hardly \u201coutside one small district of Greece\u201d or that Greek drama lasted as a living form \u201cnot much beyond the limits of the fifth century B.C.\u201d since the available evidence, here, seems to contradict him. Thespis, for instance, was renowned for his traveling shows which were usually performed on the back of a wagon. Even so, I cannot agree with James when he claims that Greek drama did not evolve from religious ritual.\u201d Murray himself also stated that: \u201cWe must remember that the subject of Greek tragedy is always the heroic saga. It is never an invented story, and it is never the history of ordinary human beings. I should doubt if there was any named character in an Attic tragedy who was not actually in some way an object of worship: a god or hero or at least the possessor of some taboo, tomb, or oracle, or ritual.\u201d\u201d Aeschylus, the Greek poet and playwright, is renowned as the founder of Greek drama. He is the first of the only three Attic tragedians of whose work entire plays survive. \u201cThe first thing that strikes a student of Aeschylus,\u201d according to Murray, \u201cis the strong Bacchic or Dionysiac element ... \u201d* More than that: \u201cThe ancient critics seem always to recognize that, while Dionysus was, of course, the patron of all drama, there was something specifically Dionysiac about Aeschylus.\u201d\u201d Nor is this merely Murray\u2019s contention. The Greek biogra- pher, Plutarch, himself had had it stated that all of the plays written by Aeschylus were \u201cbrimming with Dionysus.\u201d* Here, an incident in the life of Aeschylus may be pertinent. Apparently, the playwright himself once acted a part in one of his own plays in which there was a reference to the god- dess Demeter. The audience, who suspected him of revealing the inviolable secrets of one of Demeter\u2019s rites, rose in anger against him. Aeschylus fled, seeking sanctuary, to the alter of Dionysus which was erected in the orchestra and thus, at least temporarily, saved himself",

He was later charged with the crime before the Areopagus, in Athens, but his plea that he had not known that what he had uttered was supposed to have been a secret was accepted by the court who acquitted him. Murray, of course, is not the only mod- ern authority who holds, or held, the view that Greek drama had its origin in Dionysian rituals. According to Karl Kerenyi \u201c[Fried- rich] Nietzsche [also] believed that in line with an unassailable tradition, the oldest forms of Greek tragedy dealt exclusively with the sufferings of Dionysus, and that for a long time the sole hero of tragedy was Dionysus.\u201d\u201d Like James, Kerenyi himself did not quite agree, even going as far as la- beling Nietzche\u2019s assertion as false. \u201cThe oldest stage hero,\u201d as far as Kerenyi was concemed, \u201cwas an enemy of Dionysus.\u201d\u201d _ But I will not quibble here as to whether it - was Dionysus or his enemy who was con- Greek theatrical mask. sidered to have been the hero of early Greek tragic drama since this does not alter the fact that such tragedies were originally concerned with the life and downfall of Dionysus himself. Thus, as Jane Harrison noted: \u201cThe plays were performed in the theatre of Dionysus, in the precinct of the god, his image was present in the theatre, the chorus danced around his altar, his priest sat in the front and central seat among the spectators. In the face of facts so plain it seems to me impossible that the drama had its roots elsewhere than in the worship of Diony- sus. Let us, however, temporarily set the opinions of modern scholars aside. What should really concern us is what the ancient Greeks themselves had to say, because, after all, it was they who were in the best position to illuminate us on the subject. In this respect, we have al- ready noted what Plutarch had stated concerning the Dionysiac content of Aeschylus\u2019 plays. But what of Greek drama in general? According to Herodotus, the Greek historian, \u201cthe tragic chorus\u201d that was part and parcel of Greek drama belonged \u201cto the worship of Dionysus.\u201d\u201d Aristotle went even further when he wrote that tragedy \u201coriginated with the leaders of the dithyramb,\u201d\u00ae a wild choric hymn sung in honor of Dionysus by participants masquerading as satyrs, from which the festivals of Dionysus developed.

In this instance, as in many others, however, no borrowing need be called for. What is at bottom here is that whatever it was that Dionysus had originally stood for was the very same thing that the Egyptian Osiris had originally represented. Or, to put it in a simpler way, Osiris and Dionysus were representations of the same original phenomenon; they were simply one and the same god under different national guise. Others, of course, have maintained that the similarity of Greek rituals to those of the Egyptians stems from the ignorance of the Greeks in matters Egyptian. Thus, for in- stance, Gwyn Griffiths tried to convince his readers that Greek observers were \u201cnot usu- ally in a position\u201d to understand Egyptian religion particularly because of their igno- rance of the Egyptian language.\u201d Thus, ac- cording to Griffiths, Greek theological ex- planations of Egyptian religious particulars and mythological equations were based on ee Dionysus.",

As we have seen, despite the odd dissenter, modern opinion mainly reflects that of the Greeks themselves who seem to have attained a degree of unanimity\u2014by no means the ac- customed expectancy\u2014on this particular subject. Let us not, after all, forget that the very word \u201ctragedy,\u201d in Greek tragodia, means nothing more than \u201cgoat song,\u201d derived from tra- gos, that is \u201cgoat,\u201d the sacred animal of Dionysus. Despite its enigmatic name, the goat song itself was sung in honor of Dionysus, describing his birth and violent end. That the term \u201cgoat song\u201d \u2014 tragodia\u2014became a synonym for \u201cmisfortune\u201d is therefore understandable. Christians, if no one else, can at least understand this much: What could be more tragic than the violent death of a god? ORALITY Myths and rituals originated in the days before the invention of writing. Prior to that, myths were handed down orally. That having been said, the next question the critic will ask is: How reliable can a report of anything be if it has been handed down orally for an untold number of years before it was even written down? And, to be sure, the reliability of oral tradition has been the subject of controversy since the time of Euhemerus.* In our own world, as we all know, different eyewitnesses are liable to offer different ver- sions of any single event even when the reports are collected within a very short time of the occurrence. Not only that, but, with each telling, each report becomes more embellished until all semblance of truth is muddied beyond recognition. Can you imagine the reliability of such reports being handed down by word-of-mouth over a few thousand years? And yet, as Dorothy Vitaliano shrewdly observed, how often have parents retold a bed- time story only to be found corrected if they deviate by as much as a single word from the original version told? Such is the power of oral tradition\u2014as notice, to give but one example,",

        "main_text": "the accuracy with which the people of sub-Saharan Africa managed to preserve their history, without the aid of a written language, up until the advent of the colonial period.\u201c As Peter Hallberg pointed out in relation to the Icelandic skalds, when history is transmit- ted through a succession of professional bards with highly trained memories and powers of tecollection, there is reason to believe that, when put into writing even after a few centuries, the details remain more than reasonably accurate.* Thus Alfred de Grazia was echoing re- ceived opinion when he stated: \u201cWe know from general anthropology and ancient literature that an exact rendition of a large body of verse and prose (such as Homer\u2019s Iliad and other epic works) can be transmitted over generations and centuries...[I]n the period of oral transmission, trained speakers can memorize and reproduce exactly thousands of lines heard from the lips of a teacher.\u201d To paraphrase Peter Warlow\u2019s astute words, the main secret behind the retention and im- mediate recall of any part, or all, of a particular epic, regardless of its enormity of lines, is the systematic learning by rote, or repetition. As he aptly demonstrated, this is made evident by the effortless recall of nursery rhymes learned by rote in early childhood together with other poems and quotations drummed into youngsters in school and college. It is by rote, which Warlow calls \u201cthe basic way,\u201d that every child learns the complexities of speech, the chronological order of the alphabet, the days in the month, multiplication tables, spelling aids, and other fundamentals in the early garnering of knowledge. He was nowhere near ex- aggerating when he referred to rote learning as \u201can incredibly powerful technique.\u201d\u201d It has also been hypothesized that the hexameter of Homer\u2019s verses was inherited from an earlier oral tradition and that it was this very hexameter that helped preserve the epics.* If this was so, verbatim memorization may not even have been necessary. According to Milman Parry, the hexameters of poetic sagas such as the Iliad and Odyssey are not simply con- structed of word-units but of formulas. These constitute \u201cgroups of words [co-ordinated pre- cisely] for dealing with traditional materials, each formula shaped to fit a hexameter line.\u201d Thus, for instance, as Walter Ong noted, the phrase \u201cthere spoke out clever Odysseus\u201d occurs seventy two times in Homer\u2019s poems.\u201d Such a formula would be easy to remember every time Odysseus is introduced to say something. Personally, I disagree emphatically with Ong when, from this, he also surmises that Odysseus was thought of as being clever\u2014\u201cpolymetis\u201d\u2014not because he was supposed to have been, but because \u201cwithout the epithet polymetis he could not be readily worked into the meter.\u201d According to Ong, all of Homer\u2019s characters, including the deities, received their time-worn epithets in order to fit the correct metrical lines of the epics in which they appear. This is difficult to believe when one remembers that the same, or similar, epithets were be- stowed on the comparative deities of other nations which appear in poetic sagas employing an entirely different meter from that of Homer. In various other cases, deities carry the same,",

In recent years, an interesting experiment was conducted by Hildegard Wiencke-Lotz who traveled some 45,000 miles through Europe in an all-encompassing effort to track the various versions of the Gudrun Epic still \u201csung\u201d in those parts and to verify, if possible, the historicity of its setting and occurrences. Previously believed to be \u201clittle more than a fairy tale in three parts, of which the middle part possibly reflected some historical events,\u201d the Gudrun Epic was demonstrated by Wiencke-Lotz to be \u201can ancient oral tradition representing a unified whole which loses its meaning when the three parts are considered separately.\u201d* As David Griffard, relying on notes by William Douglas, as well as the work of Wiencke-Lotz herself, was able to report: \u201c[Wiencke-Lotz] argues that the entire Gudrun Epic has a sound historical basis and that all specific places mentioned can be found where expected geographically, though their distribution covers a large geographical area. She has identified and vis- ited the numerous places named in the tales and has traced the specific period of Gu- drun\u2019s life in relation to Roman history.\u201d\u00ae What emerged from this study is that the epic is exclusively indigenous to those territo- ries which had, at one time or another, been occupied by the Goths.

Their rendition of Gudrun songs and/or tales was found to be \u201cabsolutely trustworthy\u201d when compared to the epic as it had been immortalized in writing in 1233, even though the recitals were anything but verba- tim duplications of it. In the meantime, the recitals themselves were always repeated in exactly the same way. This was so true that, on one occasion, when a particular story- teller deliberately, and mischievously, changed a line, \u201cthere was a drastic interrup- tion, even from the toddlers\u201d who immedi- ately sought to correct the narrator.* One telling conclusion, among others, that can be drawn from this study is that, de- spite a passage of more than the 400 years which supposedly separate Homer from the events he narrated, the Gudrun Epic has re- tained geographical, historical, and archaeo- logical accuracy with a consistency that can only be attributed to a faithful persistence in the original. In its turn, this faithfulness can only be the result of a honing of memory through learning by rote and, perhaps, to give Parry his due, by formula. LITERACY Need I even state that the invention of writing revolutionized the ancient world? And yet, despite its many advantages, writ- ing does carry one disadvantage with it, a point that was not lost on the ancient Egyp- tians. Here the point I wish to make is best illustrated by the allegorical story of Thamus, a mythological king of Egypt, who, with the following words, reproached Thoth, the god of letters, for having invented writ- ing: Thoth\u2014the Egyptian god of letters.",

As Sharon Begley ef al noted: \u201cBefore there is knowledge, there must be memory. Yet few subjects remain so unknown, so obscured in metaphor and myth. According to the ancient Greeks, life is the act of recollecting knowledge the soul forgot at the moment of its birth in a body... Later thinkers noted the perversity of memories\u2014how nothing imprints them more strongly than the desire to forget.\u201d PERPLEXITY Roger Wescott recently wrote: \u201cEver since Greek philosophers first initiated critical examination of Homeric and Hesiodic myth, some mythologists have characterized myths in general as mad.\u201d* As Wallis Budge stated of Egyptian texts, the perplexity of ancient beliefs confounded even those very ancients who professed adherence to them. Speaking especially of the antiquity of the so-called Book of the Dead, Budge informed his readers that there is no doubt that \u201cthe greater part\u201d of these texts \u201care far older than the period of...the first historical king of Egypt.\u201d\u201d According to him: \u201cCertain sections indeed appear to belong to an indefinitely remote and primeval time.\u201d\u00ae Those who came later, however, did not always seem to have understood what the originals had alluded to\u2014which is exactly the situation that Thamus, in reproaching Thoth, had meant to emphasize. \u201cThe earliest texts bear within themselves proofs, not only of having been composed, but also of having been revised, or edited, long before the days of king Mena [or Menes], and judging from many passages in the copies inscribed in hieroglyphics upon the pyramids of Unas [and other early kings], it would seem that, even at that remote date, the scribes were perplexed and hardly understood the texts which they had before them.\u201d Concerning a particular, and very important, \u201cchapter\u201d of the Book of the Dead\u2014a \u201cchapter\u201d that has been considered \u201can abridgment of the whole Book of the Dead\u201d \u2014and basing his opinion on that of Chabas, Budge affirms that it was not only \u201cvery ancient\u201d and \u201cvery mysterious,\u201d but \u201cvery difficult to understand\u201d even \u201cfourteen centuries before our era.\u201d Can we, millennia later, fare any better in our attempt to understand these texts?

I sit in the pupil of the Eye.\u201d* Now I ask you, what meaning can be extracted from the above? As the \u201clord of the crown,\u201d the deity can be understood as the crowned god. Thus he can say that his seat is on his throne. There is nothing enigmatic about a crowned god sitting on his throne. But what does it mean that the deity is, or resides, \u201cin the Eye\u201d or that he sits \u201cin the pupil of the Eye\u201d? What is this \u201cEye\u201d in which the god resides? And why is the eye equated with his egg? What has an eye to do with an egg? What is this egg anyway? And yet, enigmatic as these words are, together with others pertaining to different themes, an in-depth study will reveal their coherence and even logic once the key to the symbolism behind them is understood. MISTRANSLATIONS Once myths were put into writing, mistranslations were bound to occur. Here, an illustra- tion offered by Bob Forrest comes immediately to mind. \u201cI can imagine how odd anomalies could arise in transmission, and this point was brought home to me by a curious example I came across just recently: Cinderella\u2019s glass slipper. I had always found it peculiar that the slipper should be said to be made of glass, but according to Brewer\u2019s \u2018Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\u2019 this came about via a mistranslation of the phrase \u2018pantoufle en vair\u2019 (a fur slipper) as \u2018a glass slipper\u2019 (pantoufle en verre). I do not suppose, though, that the vagaries of oral transmission can account for more than the odd \u2018peculiarity\u2019 of a myth, legend or story.\u201d\u00ae Another example concerns one of the most famous sayings attributed to Jesus: \u201cIt is eas- ier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the king- dom of God.\u201d\u201d As Vitaliano indicated, this is more than probably a mistranslation of the Greek, in which the Gospels were originally written, where the Greek word for \u201crope\u201d \u2014 kameylos \u2014was mistranslated as \u201ccamel\u201d \u2014 kamelos. \u201d This is because the sound of the Greek letter efa sounds very similar to that of epsilon to a foreign ear. Thus the words of Jesus should be translated as: \u201cIt is easier for a rope to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God\u201d\u2014which, let\u2019s face it, makes for a better simile. When it comes to Hebrew, in which the books of the Old Testament were originally set down, we encounter even greater difficulties because, for one thing, Biblical Hebrew was written without vowels, thus making for confusion between words containing the same con- sonants but different vowel sounds, and, for another, there are over a thousand Hebrew words which appear only in the Old Testament, and, in some cases, appear there only once. How, then, without comparison, can the meaning of such words be verified with certainty? As will be seen in forthcoming pages, such mistranslations, which owe more to the writ- ten word than they do to oral tradition, permeate the mythological sources of most ancient nations. But, rather than proving detrimental to our cause, such mistranslations, where found, shall actually help us ferret out the truth.",

        "main_text": "MISINTERPRETATIONS The casual reader of popular mythology may not realize to what extent the subject is in- fused with astronomical content. This is partly due to the aversion displayed by most modern mythologists to anything in their studies that smacks of astronomical connections. This is so true that when Girogio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend dared to go against the com- mon trend in their monumental work, Hamlet\u2019s Mill, they found the doors of academia closed shut in their face. As Martin Bernal found reason to state: \u201cHaving written a major book on Galileo, de Santillana [whom Bernal qualifies as possibly the greatest historian of Renaissance science] became interested in the Her- metic Egyptian tradition; then, late in life, he read Dupuis\u2019s Origine de tous les cultes, and was convinced by its argument that much of ancient mythology was indeed alle- gory for scientific astronomy. \u201cDespite de Santillana\u2019s enormous reputation, Hamlet\u2019s Mill\u2014the book in which he and a younger German colleague [Hertha von Dechend] set out [such a mytho-astro- nomical] scheme\u2014was not accepted by any university press and was published com- mercially. This means that respectable scholars are not obliged to take such work into account. In addition, de Santillana\u2019s having stuck his neck out so far lessened his ef- fectiveness as a [historian]. Furthermore, his work ... could be lumped together with a more or less \u2018lunatic fringe\u2019; this allowed or even compelled orthodox scholars to ignore it.\u201d\u201d Earlier in this century, mythologists were quite aware of the astronomical nature of an- cient myths, but, of lately, the general assumption has been that these astral connections are of late derivation, having been foisted on an already existing mythology. So much can be said against this that volumes, of which this is one, can be written. The problem, however, goes deeper than that because even those earlier mythologists who had accepted the astronomical nature of the myths were themselves often guilty of tam- pering with their sources so that, today, it is not easy to discern what these ancient sources really had to say about the cosmic powers our ancestors venerated. This is not to be wondered at because, if one had to pursue the astronomical motifs inherent in most of mythology, one would be forced to assume that the ancients\u2019 perception of the celestial sphere was entirely different from that of modern man. Thus, when modern mythologists pursue these astral myths, they tend to look up at the sky, if only figuratively, and realize that what the ancient records state about the planets, and even the Sun and Moon, bears absolutely no resemblance to the present Solar System. And yet one must keep in mind that these self-same ancients, as we shall see in the next chapter, were quite sophisticated when it came to observational astronomy. Thus something of a dilemma faces the mythologist as was poignantly demonstrated, a few decades ago, by Irene Nicholson. In a Mayan scheme purported to describe the celestial sphere, Nicholson discovered that the planet Venus was positioned above the Sun, below which was the Milky Way and, below that, the Moon.\u201d Knowing full well that the Maya had been better astronomers than that, she attempted to circumvent the problem by blaming these disparities on a faulty record.",

Be- sides mistranslations, however, there has also been a fair amount of misin- terpretation. Here Nicholson was trapped by her predecessors who had already identified certain Mayan objects as the Sun, the Moon, and the Milky Way. It did not occur to her that these objects might have been misidentified. Such misidentifications and, therefore, misinterpretations litter past works on mythology. Ask anyone who has even a modest knowledge of mythology to name the sun-god par excellence, and he or she would probably point to the Egyptian Ra (or Re). And why not? Is that not what most books on mythology claim? The Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology is very specific: \u201cRa (or Re or Phra), which probably signifies \u2018creator,\u2019 is the name of the sun, sovereign lord of the sky.\u201d\u201d So also with James Frazer, who echoed this Egyptian dictum when he stated: \u201cThat Ra was both the physical sun and the sun-god is of course undisputed ... \u201c\u201d But then one conducts an in-depth study of this Egyptian \u201cphysical sun\u201d and \u201csun- \u2018The Egyptian god Ra, said to be the god\u201d only to come to the realization that, personification of the Sun, but whose motions and characteristics do not fit the role of the Sun.",

        "main_text": "except for the fact that Ra shone brightly in the sky, the characteristics, and even motions, attributed to Ra do not fit the role of the Sun. Thus, for example, Ra was often lauded as \u201cLord of the Circles\u201d and as \u201che who entereth [or liveth] in the Circle.\u201d\u201d He was described as \u201cthe sender forth of light into his Circle\u201d and as the \u201cGovernor of [his] circle.\u201d\u2122 What is this Circle that the hymns allude to? Egyptologists will immediately inform us that this Circle of which the hymns speak was what the Egyptians referred to as the Duat (or Tuat), a word that has been rendered into English as \u201cthe Underworld.\u201d That may be so, but the fact remains that Ra was said to have shone from within it. What becomes obvious, in other words, is that, whatever Ra once signified, it was a celestial body that resided within a circle or band or ring. As we all know, the Sun does not send forth its rays into a circle; it does not reside in a ring. There will now be those who will tell me that, under certain conditions, the Sun is seen to be surrounded by a ring. They will of course be alluding to that atmospheric re fraction which lends a halo, known as parhelia, to the solar orb. But not only is this too rare an apparition to have earned Ra his title of \u201cGovernor of his Circle\u201d and/or \u201cLord of the Circles,\u201d it is also a phenomenon that is restricted to northern regions and hardly, if ever, seen at the latitude of Egypt. But there is more. When pictured on the walls of temples and on papyri, Ra is often shown surmounted with a red or golden disc, which is not inappropriate if the Sun is truly being represented. In the liturgies dedicated to him, however, Ra is described as having shed a green, rather than a golden, light. Thus a hymn to Ra states: \u201cThou hast come with thy splendours, and thou hast made heaven and earth bright with thy rays of pure emerald light.\u201d\u201d In another hymn we read: \u201cO Ra ... the heir of eternity, self-begotten and self-born, king of earth, prince of the netherworld ... thou dost rise in the horizon of heaven and sheddest upon the world beams of emerald light ...\u201c\u00ae Not only did this sun shed a green, or emerald, light, it itself was green. As Donald Mackenzie informed his readers, in his form of Sebek-Tum-Ra, this sun was the \u201cradiant green disk.\u201d \u201cHail Green One,\u201d was the manner in which Ra was lauded.\u201d Mythologists have nothing to say by way of explaining why the ancient Egyptians al- luded to the Sun as having been green and shedding a green light. And, as long as they con- tinue to believe that Ra was the Sun, how can they? Does our Sun shed a green light? Is the disk of the present sun green? Consider further the motions of the celestial object called Ra. In a statement found in one of the Coffin Texts, the deity is addressed with these words: \u201cYou shall go up upon the great West side of the sky and go down upon the great East side of the earth.\u201d\u201d Is not this contrary to what the present Sun does? Does the Sun today \u201cgo up\u201d in the west? Does it \u201cgo down\u201d in the east? Thus Faulkner, who translated this passage, could not help stating that this \u201cunexpected reversal of the points of the compass is incomprehensible\u201d\u2122\u2014and ended up by",

But, as David Talbott has indicated, \u201cwherever the di- rection of the [sun] ship\u2019s movement is explicitly connected with the phases of morning and evening the texts always reverse the direction expected by the solar interpretation.\u201d\u00ae Worse than that, when sailing in his ship, or boat, Ra is said to move down at dawn,\u201d and \u201cupstream\u201d at night,\u00ae contrary to what we see the Sun doing in our sky at present. There are many other characteristics of Ra that do not conform with the appearance and motions of our Sun which, in order not to anticipate the major thesis of this book, I will leave for later chapters. In the meantime I would simply like to add that the items I have so far touched upon have not really gone unnoticed by mythologists. Each and every datum that will be analyzed in this work have been noted and, in some cases, even discussed. Unfortu- nately, these incongruous astronomical oddities have never been collected in one place in an effort to analyze them as a whole\u2014which is exactly what I intend to do in the chapters that will follow. CONTRADICTIONS Contradictions permeate ancient accounts. This is especially true, but not restricted to, the tales contained in the Old Testament and those that constitute what is generally termed Clas- sical mythology. To give but just two examples: In chapter six of the Book of Genesis, which describes the loading of the ark in prepara- tion for the coming deluge, it is written that God commanded Noah to take aboard two, a male and a female, of every living beast.\u201d But in chapter seven of the same book, the com- mand to Noah is to take aboard two only of unclean beasts, but seven of every clean beast as well as of every kind of fowl.\u201d Why the difference? The second example I will give comes from Greek mythology and concerns the goddess Athena. According to Hesiod, the father of Greek didactic poetry, Athena was born from the head of Zeus,\u201d a tale that became very popular among the ancient Greeks. But, despite the notability of Hesiod\u2019s tale, Athena\u2019s parentage, as also the nature of her birth, was not unanimously agreed upon among the Hellenes. To some it was Poseidon who fathered Athena, Zeus becoming her adopted father only because the goddess disowned the god of the sea.\u201d To others, Athena\u2019s father was Itonus, king of Iton in Phithiotis.\u00ae Next in popularity to Hesiod\u2019s tale was that which claimed that Athena was fathered by the giant Pallas whom she later slew and flayed.\u201d According to Apollodorus, on the other hand, Pallas was the name of Athena\u2019s playmate whom she also slew, but accidentally, while engaged in friendly",

        "main_text": "combat.\u201d Apollonius Rhodius tells us that, according to the Pelasgians, Athena was born on the shores of Lake Tritonis in North Africa,\u201d having been fostered by Triton (or Tritos), the deity of the lake.\u201d Philo Byblius, basing his report on that of Sanchoniathon and quoted by Eusebius of Caesarea, stated that Athena was the daughter of Kronos.* So which of these versions, if any, is the correct one? Better still: If, as stated above, mythic lore was faithfully transmitted by word of mouth through the ages before it became engraved in writing, how did we end up with so many different versions of the same tale? While it is tempting to blame such contradictions on faulty recording when these myths were first written down, such is not always the case. The example given above concerning Noah from the Book of Genesis was not chosen at random. It was chosen specifically to clarify a conundrum. Thus, in that passage which tells that only two of every beast was to be taken aboard the ark, the instructions come from Elohim, an ancient name which is usually translated as \u201cGod\u201d in most English versions of the Old Testament. But in the passage which specifies that seven should be the number taken on board of the beasts designated as clean, the command is said to have come from Yahweh, sometimes rendered \u201cJehovah,\u201d another ancient name which is usually translated as \u201cthe Lord\u201d in English versions of the same work. We shall not, at this point, involve ourselves in a discussion concerning whether or not these two names\u2014 Yahweh and Elohim\u2014were but two different designations for one and the same deity. We shall leave that for later. Biblical scholars, however, had long ago realized that the Old Testament preserves more than one tradition, and that, among other things, these different traditions can be recognized by the name applied to what one usually considers as having been \u201cGod.\u201d One of these traditions referred to the deity as Elohim, another tradition referred to him as Yahweh. Thus Biblical scholars refer to these different versions, among others, as the Elohist tradition on the one hand, and the Yahwist tradition on the other. Origi- nally, these different traditions belonged to different peoples who had passed on their tradi- tions by word of mouth, without change, from one generation to the next. But, as happened so often in the past, these different peoples merged to become one nation even though each faction was persistent in retaining its particular version of what they believed to have tran- spired in the past. At an even later time, when they decided to put their history into writing, these various traditions were incorporated as a unified, but not seamless, whole. And that, to put it simply, is what the Old Testament, as it exists today, consists of. So, similarly, with the ancient Greeks, who referred to themselves as Hellenes, suppos- edly after Helen of Troy, a nation that was forged from the remnants of earlier civilizations and wandering tribes\u2014Pelasgians, Minoans, Mycenaeans, Achaeans, Trojans, Ionians, Dori- ans, and heaven knows who else\u2014each of whom brought their own traditions into that Indo- European melting pot that has become known as Greek history and Classical mythology. Even so, why should there be more than one version of any one particular myth? Here I can best ask the reader to consider an event from the modern world\u2014the blowing up, by the invading army, of the colossal swastika that had towered above the Germans in symbolic splendor above so many Nazi rallies. As Lewis Greenberg noted: \u201cThere appears to be some confusion over which swastika was dynamited, with some opting for one over the Reichstag",

It hap- pened at a time when the recording of history had already reached perfection, at a time when events could be frozen and immortalized on film. And, as it happens, the event in question was exactly so documented. As Greenberg noted: \u201cThe last two choices are definitely in error. Film footage of the great swastika being blown up (as seen in the film The Enigma of the Swastika) leaves no doubt and clearly indicates that it was the Zeppelinfeld swastika.\u201d If the memory of events from the recent past can get to be so confused, why should we wonder about the faulty memory concerning events from a much more remote past? But then, without a film to document these earlier events, how can we ever be sure of what really transpired? Two lessons to be learned from the above example are these: Despite the differing ver- sions as to which swastika was blown up by the invading army, all reports agree on one fact: A colossal swastika in Germany was blown up by the invading army. That is the core of this particular historical event. And, in many cases when dealing with contradictory versions of a particular myth, it is the core of the event that we must hold on to and not necessarily the de- tailed trimmings, many of which were, in any case, appended to the myths at a much later time. Thus, whether it was just one pair or seven of each animal that Noah was said to have taken into his ark, the core of the different tales remains that he did take male and female specimens of the animals on board. The second lesson is that various versions of an event can be compared and, with a little help from logic, the correct one can often, if not always, be as- certained. When it comes to the science of mythology\u2014and it is a science\u2014comparison can be a very effective tool. COMPARISONS Hermann Collitz had this to say about the subject: \u201cComparative mythology, in co-operation with the study of popular traditions (folklore), has been especially studied with assiduity...Mythological science is not intended to serve the knowledge of cultural development\u2014be it of a people or of a group of closely related peoples\u2014it does not primarily co-operate with philology, but it looks for similar ideas in different peoples and it tries to determine types which are repeated in the course of time.\u201d In other words, comparative mythology is that branch of mythology which compares the myths of one nation, or race, with those of another\u2014and, sometimes, even compares the myths of one particular nation, or race, with the divergent myths found within the same na- tion or race. Among other things, this is done in order to identify the unidentified protago- nists in one myth with the identified ones in another, but similar, tale. An example that comes to mind is the following:",

        "main_text": "A tale from the Hindu lore of India concerns the goddess Kali whose thirst for gore\u2014she is often portrayed with hanging tongue and mouth dripping with blood\u2014was developed after she had slain the asura (or demon) Raktavira (also known as Raktabija). From every drop of blood that fell to the ground from the wounded asura, there sprang another demon possessing his courage, strength, and valor.'\u00ae In order to keep Raktavira\u2019s blood from reaching the ground, and thus generating further demons, Kali, also known as Durga, was forced to drink it as it gushed out. This drinking of blood gave her such a blind lust for violence that, when she gave free reign to it, nothing was able to stop her. \u201cOn one occasion Shiva himself had to mingle among the demons whom she was slaughtering and allow himself to be trampled un- derfoot in her dance of victory, as this was the only way to bring her to her senses and save the world from collapse.\u201d '\u00ae This myth is very similar to one involving the goddess Anath. In a myth from Ugarit we see Anath coming to the aid of Baal when he was beset by his enemies. As cruel a goddess as Kali, Anath did not limit her slaughter to demons but went on a drunken rampage against mankind from \u201cfrom the rising of the sun\u201d to \u201cthe shore of the sea.\u201d\"\u2122 In the end, Baal was forced to intervene in order to stop the goddess from annihilating mankind. As William Albright reported: \u201cIt has been pointed out by Marvin Pope that there are many traits which Anath shares in common with the Indic goddess Kali or Durga. In fact, the respective figures are in some ways so similar that coincidence can scarcely be the only explanation.\u201d Yet another similar myth that both Pope and Albright failed to notice comes to us from ancient Egypt. Here we read of the goddess Sekhmet, who was said to have been Ra\u2019s de- structive eye, being hurled in anger at mankind. Incited by Ra himself, the goddess began a slaughter so complete that she ended up by flooding the world in blood. In both this myth and that of Anath, each respective goddess is described as wading up to her waist in gore. In the end, like both Shiva and Baal, Ra himself was forced to intervene and call the goddess back. As can be seen, there seems to be no doubt that, in the above three myths, despite the dif- ference in details, the same event is being described. This leads to the assumption, which we can state beyond a reasonable doubt, that the three goddesses, Kali (or Durga), Anath, and Sekhmet were merely different names, applied by different nations who spoke different lan- guages, of one and the same goddess. Let me now concentrate on Anath (sometimes transliterated as Anat) in order to further illustrate the methodology behind comparative mythology. What we know of this goddess comes mostly, but not solely, from the tablets discovered at Ras Shamra, the ancient Ugarit, in a priest\u2019s house adjoining the temple of Baal.'\u201d In one of these texts we read that Anat was described as a \u201cstar.\u201d\"\u00ae Her alter-ego, the Persian Anahita (sometimes transliterated as",

        "main_text": "DIFFUSION Joseph Campbell, perhaps the most popular mythologist of the latter half of the twentieth century, began the first tome of his four-volume work, The Masks of God, by pointing out that the \u201ccomparative study of the mythologies of the world compels us to view the cultural history of mankind as a unit; for we find that such themes as the fire-theft, deluge, land of the dead, virgin birth, and resurrected hero have a worldwide distribution\u2014appearing every- where in new combinations while remaining, like the elements of a kaleidoscope, only a few and always the same.\u201d\"\u201d\u00b0 It was thus his view, as it has been that of many another mytholo- gist, that the ideas inherent in the mythological record owe their universal distribution to a radiating diffusion, especially by contact and mainly from \u201cthe nuclear Near East.\u201d As he had it stated: \u201cThe archaeology and ethnography of the past half-century have made it clear that the ancient civilizations of the Old World\u2014those of Egypt, Mesopotamia, Crete and Greece, India and China\u2014derived from a single base, and that this community of origin suffices to explain the homologous forms of their mythological and ritual structures.\u201d\"\u201d To be sure, there is no doubt that ideas\u2014knowledge\u2014traveled from one people to another. Thus, for in- stance, it has been known for years that ancient Greek astronomical beliefs owed their impe- tus to Babylonian knowledge, as well as to that of other nations. One may therefore suppose that the similarity of the myths enumerated above conceming the goddesses Anath, Kali, and Sekhmet could have been passed on from one people to an- other. Is it not possible, for instance, that the Indo-European Aryans brought the myth of Kali with them, which myth was then passed on to both Canaan and Egypt through migrational contact? Possible, yes; but, despite Campbell, highly unlikely, especially since the three god- desses do not share a common, or similar, name. Thus, for instance, while we can see the similarity \u2014or, actually, the evolution\u2014of the names from the Canaanite Anath, or Anat, to the Persian Anahita, Anahid, and/or Anaitis, from which we can safely suppose a diffusional contact, direct or otherwise, between Canaan and later Persia, there is nothing linguistically related between the names Anath, Kali, and Sekhmet. Nor do these three goddesses share a similarity in their physical depiction. Although pictorial depictions of Anath are rare, she is usually portrayed as a seductive-looking female with a very distinctive hair style shaped in the form of the Greek letter omega. Kali, on the other hand, is always depicted as a ferocious- looking and emaciated hag with disheveled hair, vampiric fangs, a lolling tongue, and shriv- eled pendulous breasts. And while Sekhmet, like Anath, is also shown having the slim con- toured form of a woman, she is invariably given the head of a lioness. One would think that, had two of these goddesses been borrowed from the mythological lore of another nation, or race, they would have retained some similarity of the original\u2019s name and physical appear- ance. As we have seen, however, it is only in the detailed account of their crazed and bloody acts of destruction and death-dealing annihilation that the three goddess bear any similarities. On the other hand, without wishing to contradict the above, the cult of the goddess Anat did find its way from Canaan to Egypt. Among her various epithets, Anat was known as Qadesh, or Qudshu, which simply meant \u201choly.\u201d'\u00ae The worship of this goddess, together with others of Near Eastern origin, was introduced into Egypt when the Egyptians began to infiltrate Palestine. Even so, despite their attempt to Egyptianize the goddess, mainly by depicting her in the company of Egyptian deities, her name of Qudshu (Qetesh or Qeteshi)",

The fact that the Egyptian Hathor was similarly portrayed by the Egyptians, while not coinci- dental, should not blind us to this fact.) There is therefore no doubt that cults and rituals were transferred from one culture to another, but, when this transpired, it left its tell-tale marks. No such marks are obvious between the cults of Anath and Sekhmet despite the similarity of their myths. As William Heidel pointed out as early as 1929, \u201cthe facile assimilation of one rite to the other ... was probably due to the recognition of a common basis in ritual forms.\u201d'\u00ae He, however, warns that there should be \u201cmade no assumption of direct borrowing of motives, as is often done; such an assumption is methodically without justification where other explana- tions of such points of agreement as may be found are possible and sufficient.\u201d \u2122 \u201cIdeas, without a material substratum to which they are related, are not so easily communicated as some historians appear to suppose; the experience of the Western world with the East in our day would seem to show that concrete objects and modes of behaviour are far more readily adopted than ideas and ideals.\u201d '\u201d Similar mythological ideas are not, however, restricted to the ancient lore of Asia, Eu- rope, and Egypt. They are also to be found on opposite shores of the Old World and the New. Consider, for example, the following aspects of the myths of Osiris and Quetzalcoatl. In Mesoamerica, the priest-king known as Quetzalcoatl was thought of as a civilizer, a compassionate being, a lawgiver and inventor of the calendar.'* The Egyptian Osiris was also thought of as a civilizer. Having become king of Egypt, he imparted the arts of civilization to his subjects. He taught them how to till the land, formu- lated a code of laws by which they should live, and instituted the rites of the gods.\u2019 Toward the end of his tragic life, Quetzalcoatl \u201cordered ... that a stone casket should be built in which he was to lie four days and nights in strict penance.\u201d The end of Osiris was similarly woeful. His brother and enemy, Set\u2014whom his biogra- pher, Plutarch, refers to as Typhon\u2014managed to trap him within a chest, which he instantly nailed shut and flung into the river.\u201d When Quetzalcoatl died\u2014some said by throwing himself on a funeral pyre\u2014his heart flew out of him into the sky to become the Morning Star.'\u201d\u201d Now, as is well known, Egyptian rites of the dead attempted to assimilate the deceased pharaoh to Osiris. In the Text of Unas it is told that \u201cthe king\u2019s soul, provided with its words of power, flew with its wings to heaven, and \u2018opened\u2019 its seat there with the stars of the sky, and itself became the morning star ... \u201c\"* Since the dead king was believed to recreate the",

At this point I should perhaps point out that there have been various scholars who have gone to great pains in attempting to prove pre-Columbian cultural contact across the Atlantic between the Old and the New World\u2014even between Egypt and Mesoamerica.\u201d And let us not forget that, in his 1970 voyage from Africa to Barbados in a replica of an Egyptian reed boat, Thor Heyerdahl, if nothing else, did prove the fea- sibility of such voyages. More recently, Vincent Malmstr\u00e9m has also suggested the possibility of pre-Columbian contact across the Pacific between East Asia and Mesoamerica,\u201d although, in a later work, he seems to have limited this contact to Japan.\u201d Mainstream diffusionists, however, do not generally adhere to these hypotheses, preferring instead to think that any diffusion of Asian ideas into the New World could only have passed into North America, together with the nomads who brought them, across the once-existent Bering land bridge from where the ideas dispersed throughout the rest of the continent. That there is no direct borrowing be- tween the two myths in question, however, should be quite evident. Despite the similar- ity in the essence of the two tales, they are told in quite different ways. Thus, while they were both represented as civilizers, the manner in which Osiris and Quetzalcoatl met their end was differently told\u2014the one self-sacrificed on a funeral pyre, the other suffocated in a chest.

But it was not, as generally believed, diffusion by contact. On the contrary, it seems to have been diffusion by separation. DIVINE REVELRY At this point, it should perhaps be pointed out that the problems involved in the interpre- tation of mythology is not merely a modern concern. The same problems occupied the minds of the ancients themselves\u2014definitely the ancient Greeks who were very \u201cconcerned with the relation of rationalism to traditional beliefs.\u201d\"* As Fred Bratton noted: \u201cThe Sophists and Neoplatonists anticipated one modern solution by defining myths as allegories that symbolized moral or spiritual truth and were not to be taken liter- ally. The Neoplatonic and Stoic philosophers of the Hellenistic period were thus able to hold both to tradition and rationalism. This method of interpretation was rejected by Plato and the later Epicureans as just a way of keeping intact the traditional super- natural beliefs of the state religion and keeping the facts of history from the people. The emperor Julian regarded myths as esoteric teachings understood only by the intel- lectual aristocracy. The early Christian theologians discredited the pagan myths while teaching new ones for the Hebrew and Christian religions.\u201d '\u201d Other than as a form of art, often more of a voluptuous or heroic nature than not, mythol- ogy is not much valued by the modern layman. Yet, in one form or another\u2014and this in- cludes past and recent occultism among our youth\u2014religion is. Here lies one of the major in- congruities of the problem I wish to address because, in essence, religion is only the philo- sophical interpretation and mystic ritualization of myth. The forms which man\u2019s various religions have taken in the past, and continue to take in the present, are endless. The names of his past and present gods are legion. The rituals he has invented with which he has sought, and continues to seek, divine protection and godly bless- ing have run the gamut from love feasts to horrible mass human sacrifice. Throughout the ages, the expositional interpretation and theological apologetics concerning his rites and be- liefs have filled untold volumes most of which do nothing but contradict each other. Meanwhile, the discoveries of anthropology and archaeology keep adding evidence not only of the antiquity of man\u2019s basic faith but also of the universality of its thematic structure. Even that indomitable primitive, Neanderthal Man, it finally had to be admitted, had, burning in his savage breast, the desperate need to satisfy, or otherwise appease, the unseen forces",

The study of comparative religion, despite its past overall banality, has always been sub- ject to stray insights. From the very beginning of the development of western thought, the philosophes have been cognizant of the universality of certain religious rites and beliefs. Among these one can enumerate all manner of lustrative rituals; the need for some sort of re- demption; the immortality of the soul, the mind, or the human aura; the belief in paradise, hell, or some other place of existence after death; and various others. Most of these have often been explained as a psychological alleviation\u2014a ray of hope against the realization of a futile life capped with the finality of death. Man, it has been said before, is the only animal burdened with this acute awareness. It is also for this same reason that those of an unreligious bent of mind, whether they realize it or not, very often find them- selves involved in a continuous search for the supposed meaning of life. Belief in an afterlife should not, of itself, incur a belief in God. Belief in a reward, or punishment, after death, on the other hand, does\u2014for someone, or something, must exist to judge and mete out justice. This someone, this something, this God, should logically be ex- emplary. How come most of man\u2019s gods are not? The philosophic endeavor to discern moral precepts in divine action becomes something of a farce when one is confronted with the ungodly activities of most deities. The Greek gods, for instance, were guilty of patricide, butchery, cannibalism, rage, jealousy, adultery, rape, incest, deception, and slaughter without equal. These actions are not symbolic of moral precepts; they are the irresponsible adventures of a bunch of delinquent revelers. Why, then, did the Greeks look up to these imperfect gods, build them costly temples, offer them sacrifices, prayers, and invocations, while philosophers endeavored to illustrate the divinity of what they believed to be the orderly universe by comparing it with these gods? The Stoics and pagan apologists had long attempted to spiritualize the myths described by Hesiod and others. This spiritualization, in the form of allegorism, continued as the dominant mode of mythic interpretation well past the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance.'* Only half way through the seventeenth century, and more so during the eighteenth, did philoso- phers begin to reduce the fantastic episodes of classical mythology to common-sense narra- tives. But this was merely an attempt to de-allegorize the myths. The origin of the gods, to- gether with the rites connected with them, remained unexplained. The actions of the Greek gods could no longer be seen as the moral conflict between good and evil\u2014between virtue and vice\u2014for the simple reason that, according to the myths, the evil, or vice, was more often triumphant than not. Zeus was guilty of more deceptions and rapes than any other god the Greeks venerated. Yet this same Zeus was considered to be the upholder of law and order. If this divine lawlessness could not be explained allegorically, it could only mean that the gods were impervious to their own laws. Pierre Bayle took great pleasure in accumulating tales which told of the lusts of these gods and goddesses who could indulge in incestuous and homosexual rape. To him, the Greek world was a world of sex-mad divinities.\u201d Yet the Greeks of ancient times believed that these actions, normally repugnant even to them despite their hedonistic society, actually took place precisely as narrated by the early poets\u2014 by Hesiod, by Homer, and others.",

        "main_text": "Pheidias, architect of the Parthenon and sculptor of the colossal Athena Parthenos, was accused of an act of impiety simply because one of the figures on Athena\u2019s shield was thought to resemble him. Epicurus, because he was bold enough to teach a school of mixed sexes, caused a scandalous stir in his day. When Praxiteles sculpted his famous Aphrodite, the people of Cos were shocked by the complete nudity of the figure. Socrates, because he preached against the gods, was accused of blasphemy and of corrupting the youth of his time. For that he was put to death. Yet these very people, so scandalized by the impiety of their citizens, could look at their upholders of law, the gods, and excuse the atrocious actions they were portrayed as having been guilty of. Since our western world owes so much to Classical Greece, should we not wonder at the incongruity of this affair? Should we not ask the question: What was it that made the an- cients\u2014and the Greeks were not the only ones\u2014bow their heads to such consistent lawless- ness in the lives of their upholders of law? CELESTIAL DIVINITIES From Greek sources comes the following well-known tale of divine family conflict: The goddess Gaea bore a son called Ouranos and then lay with him in incest. Ouranos\u2019 children, born of Gaea, planned a revolt against their father. Ouranos therefore imprisoned these rebellious sons. In revenge, Gaea inflamed her youngest-born, Kronos, to overthrow his father. Kronos, hiding in ambush, attacked his father and castrated him with a sickle. He then became lord of heaven in his father\u2019s stead. Fearing a similar rebellion, Kronos did not see fit to release his brethren. Worse than that, laying in incest with his sister Rhea, he commenced to devour his own offspring. But when his son Zeus was born, Rhea gave Kronos a stone to swallow in his stead. When Zeus grew to manhood, he also attacked his father and deposed him. Like Ouranos and Kronos before him, Zeus then inherited the lordship of heaven. What philosophical insights could lay buried within this tale of incest, revenge, castra- tion, patricide, cannibalism, stupidity (for how could a god have mistaken a stone for his in- fant child?), and deception? Not that philosophers have not tried. Pierre Jurieu, for instance, saw Kronos as a symbol of time which devours what it first produces.\u201d Jurieu\u2019s belief derived from the fact that, in Greek, \u201cTime\u201d is rendered Chronos, which concept they then attributed to Kronos. Jurieu did not ask what prompted the Greeks to equate time with their god Kronos\u2014and this question should have been asked in view of the fact that Kronos was also the Greek name of the planet we call Saturn. To the ancient Greeks, the planet Saturn would have appeared as nothing more than a pin- point of light in the night sky, no different than the way it appears to us with the unaided eye at present. What, then, could have impelled the Greeks to equate this pin-point of light with the abstract idea of time? When, as narrated in the above myth, Zeus deposed Kronos, did he also depose time? Better still, what does it mean that Zeus deposed Kronos?\u2014for Zeus was also the Greek name of a planet, that which today is known to us as Jupiter. What could it mean that the planet Jupiter deposed the planet Saturn? Despite what philosophers, mythologists, and students of ancient religion might have written in the past, the tale recorded above can have no philosophical meaning \u2014at least none that would not be strained. In view of the fact that Kronos and Zeus were actually deified",

After all, unlike the Sun and Moon, to the unaided eye the planets appear no more than small flickering pin-points of light lost amid a starry sea among a multitude of other flickering pin-points of light. The ancient Greeks deified all of the heavenly bodies of the Solar System that were, and still are, visible to the naked eye. Saturn was Kronos who was once king of heaven. Jupiter was Zeus who, as in the case of other planetary pantheons, seized the kingdom of the gods from his father Kronos/Saturn. Mars was known as Ares, the blood-thirsty god of war. Aphrodite, the goddess of love, perhaps the most popular of the Greek deities, was the personification of Venus. The planet Mercury was Hermes, with his winged sandals, the swiftest god among the Olympians. These planetary identifications were even adopted by those ancient peoples who came into direct contact with the Greeks. Thus, in The Book of the Secrets of Enoch, a Graeco- Jewish work from the intertestamental period, the names of the planets are so given in Greek: Kruno for Kronos/Saturn; Zeus for Jupiter; Aris for Ares/Mars; Aphrodit for Aphrodite/Venus; and Ermis for Hermes/Mercury.'\u2122 Can it however be said that, in the minds of the Greeks, planets and gods were synonymous? I pose this all-important question because critics have often denied this to have been the case. My answer is that the identity of the ancient gods as planets should never even have been questioned. The only acceptable assertion in this matter is that of those very people who once believed in, and venerated, these gods. Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend recognized this truth when they wrote: \u201cThe most \u2018ancient treasure\u2019 ... left to us by our predecessors ... was the idea that the gods are really stars, and that there are no others. The forces reside in the starry heavens, and all stories, characters and adventures narrated by mythology concentrate on the active powers among the stars, who are the planets.\u201d This is quite a claim, to say the least, when one remembers that, at the very dawn of civilization, the Sumerian list of deities already contained more than five thousand names with which to reckon'*\u2014think about it! Accepting that most of these names constitute nothing but a litany of epithets bestowed on a much shorter list of deities, the deities themselves, and the tales told about them, remain quite numerous. And yet, as we shall see, this was not merely a case of epithets, for the deities themselves were often inadvertently duplicated, triplicated, and so forth. On the other hand, to maintain that all mythological characters reduce to a handful of planets, and that all mythological tales are descriptive of planetary motions, is not, in my opinion, a defensible position. After all, in the end, man found it expedient to recognize divinity in just about everything, creating deities who would lord it over such concepts as birth, health, sleep, and death and a thousand other issues to boot. Even so, I will maintain that if we restrict ourselves to the world\u2019s major myths, de Santillana and von Dechend\u2019s claim can be validated.",

When Solon visited Egypt, he was informed that \u201cneither he nor any other Hellene knew anything worth mentioning about the times of old.\u201d\"\u201d He was told that \u201cthere is no old opinion handed down among you [Greeks] by ancient tradition, nor any science which is hoary with age.\u201d\"\u00ae The Greeks, according to the Egyptian sages, knew \u201cnothing of what happened in ancient times\u201d\u2019\u201d and this, supposedly, was due to the survivors of previous natural catastrophes who, for whatever reason, had left \u201cno written record\u201d behind them.'* The gods\u2019 eventual disassociation from the planets was also abetted by the fact that, like other nations, the Greeks were wont to allude to the planets by a different set of names when dealing with astronomical, as opposed to cosmogonical, matters. Thus, as indicated by Burnet above, we come across Saturn, who was Kronos, being referred to as Phaenon; Jupiter, who was Zeus, as Phaethon; and so forth. It should be noted, however, that these astronomical terms were not themselves devoid of mythic characteristics\u2014so that even in purely astronomical treatises, it was difficult to disassociate the study of planets from that of the gods.",

Having been widely forgotten by his immediate, but not his earlier, ancestors, he simply rediscovered this verity and sought to reaffirm it. Besides, he was not the only one to offer the assertion. Others maintained and voiced identical opinions. Among the Greeks, Lucian of Samosata also knew this truth.\"* Thus he tells us that \u201cfrom both Homer the poet and the epics of Hesiod we should understand that the ancients were of one mind with the astrologers,\u201d and that it is \u201cthe conjunction of Venus and Mars\u201d that \u201ccreates the poetry of Homer.\u201d'\u00a9 Plato, who recognized the same truth on his own, had it verified by the Egyptians. '* The Romans, who, in their turn, borrowed many of their deities from the Greeks, were no different. It is in fact to them that we owe the present names of the planets in the western world so that, to this day, the planets still bear the names of the gods. Kronos became Saturnus, the god of civilization. Zeus became Iuppiter, Diespiter, or simply lovis, and, like his counterparts throughout the world, was considered king of all the gods. Ares became Marspiter, also known as Mavors\u2014pronounced Ma-oors\u2014or Marmar, a god of war as blood-thirsty as his Greek counterpart. Aphrodite became Venus, retaining her position as the queen of Jove and feminine beauty. Hermes became Mirqurius, or Mercurius, and was honored as the god of merchandise. The synonymy of planets with gods was so entrenched among the Romans that Cicero denied the possibility of planetary orbital changes simply because he believed such changes to be contrary to the planets\u2019 divine nature.'\u201d This belief, that the gods were really deified astronomical bodies, even touched primitive peoples. Thus the name of the great Polynesian god, Ta\u2019urua, simply means \u201cstar\u201d'*\u2014and here we cannot help but note the similarity of this name to that of Tara, an epithet of Kali/Durga, mentioned earlier, which also means \u201cstar,\u201d even though no etymological con- nection between the two names has yet come to light. In old records of Tahiti, the name Ta\u2019urua is applied to Fomalhaut, a star in the constellation Pisces; to Orion\u2019s belt; to Al- phard or Cor Hydra; Betelgeuse; Canopus in the constellation Argo; Deneb in Cygnus; and Sirius. Each particular star was then identified by a clarifying epithet added to the name Ta\u2019urua.\"* The same name, however, was also applied to the planets Jupiter and Venus. The former was designated Ta\u2019urua-o-rai\u2019i-taetae\u2019a-o-Havai\u2019i-i-te-tua and the latter as Ta\u2019urua-e- hiti-Matavai.\"\u201d Among the Skidi branch of the Pawnee Indians of North America, there were some who, in a sense, might be considered to have been astronomers. These men compiled star maps; identified the constellations and the brightest stars among them; noted the planets and recorded their movements. The beginning of the Pawnee ceremonial year was co-ordinated in rites.'\" As G. A. Dorsey discovered, \u201cthe greater part of the [Pawnee] heavenly gods were",

C. Brundage, on considering the function the planet Venus played among the Mesoamericans, had no recourse but to offer the obser- vation that the planet\u2019s true role in the development of this particular culture \u201cis not under- stood.\u201d\"\u00ae He also, however, added: \u201cJt might not be far wrong to look upon the Mesoamericans\u2019 great skill in numeration as a child of that planet and to state that their intellectual life pulsed to its periods. Certainly a significant portion of their mythology involved that planet.\u201d Thus Anthony Aveni, one of the foremost archaeoastronomers of the twentieth century, could not help but avow that \u201c[flor the Maya the importance of Venus ... cannot be over- stated.\u201d\"\u201d In fact what student of Mesoamerican lore can delve into the religious beliefs of these people without running headlong into Quetzalcoatl, perhaps the greatest Mesoamerican deity, at whose death, as we have already seen, his heart flew out to become the Morning Star.

People of perfect knowledge say that Mercury is lord Narayan. O ex- cellent brahmins, the great planet Shaniscara, the slow-moving Saturn, is Yama, the lord of the worlds. The preceptors of Devas and Asuras [that is Shukra and Brihas- pati] are the great planets Venus and Jupiter with (refulgent) rays. They are mentioned as the sons of Prajapati.\u201d\"\u2122* In the Hebrew Talmud, the very meaning of \u201cidolatry\u201d is defined as the \u201cworship of stars and constellations.\u201d But none of this has stemmed criticism concerning the synonymy of planets and gods as they appear in ancient literature and beliefs. That planets were deified and worshipped as deities has, of course, been accepted\u2014and how can it be otherwise when the evidence is there for all to read about. What has not been accepted is that this has always been so. What critics generally claim is that the planets had not always been gods\u2014that, on the contrary, the deification of the planets owes its origin to a late date. But, as I have now been asking for a number of years, how late is late? Or, to ask a different question, how far back in history can this belief be traced? Ignoring, or sweeping aside, the statements of Aristotle, critics continue to maintain that the Greek identification of the planets as gods does not trace beyond the 4th century B.C. But is Greek lore the yardstick by which to measure the antiquity of anything? The Greeks, after all, came somewhat late on the ancient historical scene. What about those nations that were older, much older, than the Greeks? In Egypt the planets were also deified. Saturn was called Heru-ka-pet, that is Horus the Bull of Heaven; Jupiter was Heru-ap-sheta, the Star of the South; Venus was Sbat uatitha, the Evening Star; Mars was Heru-khuti and/or Heru-tesher, the Red Horus; and Mercury was Se- bku and/or Sebek.\u2019\u00ae Granted, it will be pointed out that these names and identifications be- came popular during the late Graeco-Roman period and that they do not trace further back than the 19th Dynasty. But the identity of the Morning Star as Horus was already known during the Old Kingdom and is found recorded more than once in the Pyramid Texts.\u201d In fact, to the ancient Egyptians, the synonymy of gods and planets was so complete that, in some instances, the same word was employed to signify either. Thus sba, among other things, meant \u201cstar,\u201d but Sba was also the name of a \u201cstar\u201d god.\u2019 The word netru meant \u201cstars,\u201d but it also meant \u201cgods.\u201d As Faulkner pointed out:",

But, strictly speaking, this is incorrect. The ancients had no need to deify the planets because, to them, the planets had always been deities. They were, to be sure, the only deities they knew. In other words, planets were gods; gods were planets: planets and gods were one and the same.

Thus Nicolas Fr\u00e9ret (1688-1749), the first permanent sec- retary of the Academie des Inscriptions, who disputed so much with Isaac Newton, was of the belief that the astronomical events al- luded to in the mythologies and described by ancient writers could only have been based on actual observations.

But, before we laugh Fr\u00e9ret out of court, let us not forget that Newton\u2019s theological seams were quite apparent in his own day, and it is only with the passage of time that historians of science have been able to hoodwink the public by downplaying his once glaring religious fundamentalism.

The question we address is why.\u201d\u201d\u201d Most mythologists who have favored an astronomical interpretation of mythology have however been handicapped by the uniformitarian dogma that the Solar System has remained unchanged for millions of years. Not only that, some of them have even utilized this dogma as the very basis for astro-mythological beliefs. Thus, for instance, Elmer Suhr who could feel confident in reporting that: \u201cAstronomy, including manifestations of sun, moon, stars, comets and meteors, has the advantage of remaining constant in its movements and consistently the same in appearance over great periods of time; its forms are more geometric, its changes more regular, all of which gave the heavens more prestige in the mind of primitive man.\u201d\u201d* This, I intend to show, has been the great pitfall of most mythologists who could not rec- oncile the heaven alluded to by our ancient forefathers with the one that now stretches above and around us. And yet, as I hope to demonstrate, it was the very opposite to what Suhr be- lieved that lay at the very foundation of mytho-astronomical belief. In fact, what I wish to stress is that the astronomical bodies of the Solar System were deified by ancient man the world over not because they consistently followed an ordained pattern, but precisely because they did not. As Lewis Farnell noted early in the twentieth century: \u201cWhat is normal in nature and so- ciety rarely excites the myth-making imagination, which is more likely to be kindled by the abnormal, some startling catastrophe, some terrible violation of the social code.\u201d And as the French anthropologist Emile Durkheim (1858-1917) pointed out: \u201c.,.that which characterizes the life of nature is a regularity which approaches monotony. Every morning the sun mounts the horizon, every evening it sets; every month the moon goes through the same cycle; the river flows in an uninterrupted manner in its bed; the same seasons periodically bring back the same sensations. To be sure, here and there an unexpected event sometimes happens: the sun is eclipsed, the moon is hidden behind clouds, the river overflows. But these momentary varia- tions could only give birth to equally momentary impressions, the remembrance of which is gone after a little while; they could not serve as a basis for these stable and permanent systems of ideas and practices which constitute religions. Normally, the course of nature is uniform, and uniformity could never produce strong emotions.\u201d*\u00b0 While not exactly an authority on mythological subjects, it is also worth noting the words of Frederick Hall who wrote: \u201cIf we will the myths their proper credence in the light of new evidence of planetary catastrophism, we will find that they can add much to our store of knowledge. All mythical accounts may not be equally authentic\u2014and surely many are garbled\u2014but",

In fact, even that so-called pillar of astrophysics, the Big Bang Theory, had been much earlier posited in a religious work. In the Book of Genesis, Elohim, usually translated into English as \u201cGod,\u201d begins the cre- ation with the words: \u201cLet there be light.\u201d And, it is there written, \u201cthere was light.\u201d There have been many who have seen a similarity between this description of beginnings and the Big Bang Theory. The following, one of several such, comes from a popular work devoted to the mysteries of the Bible: \u201cPrevailing scientific theory proposes that the universe was created in a flash of light. This \u2018big bang,\u2019 or cosmic explosion, is believed to have occurred some 16 billion years ago. Some see parallels between this modern, scientific theory and the biblical account which opens with God\u2019s command, \u2018Let there be light\u2019.\u201d\u201d\u201d Granted, on its own, this similarity is not enough for one to claim that the theory in ques- tion had already been posited in a religious work. The Book of Genesis is not, however, the religious work I have in mind. So bear with me for a while. George Gamow is the acclaimed father of the Big Bang theory. But before Gamow there was Georges Lemaitre who, in 1927, was the first to propose that a hot, dense, primeval \u201catom\u201d had exploded, flinging its contents outward to create the universe.\u201d With the advent Of the theory in question, Pope Pius XII himself had it stated that \u201cscientists are beginning to find the finger of God in the creation of the universe.\u201d\"* Lemaitre, who was a Catholic priest besides being a physicist, was later decorated by the Vatican for his scientific achieve- ments. To be quite fair, in developing his theory of the expanding universe, Lemaitre had relied on the principles of general relativity. But, since he was also well versed in the discipline of theology, could he not also have come across that great medieval commentary on Biblical Scripture known as the Ramban? In 1990, in a book titled Genesis and the Big Bang, the Is- raeli nuclear physicist Gerald Schroeder argued in detail that there is no contradiction to be found between the account of creation as described in Genesis and the current scientific dic- tum.\u201d\u00b0 Moreover, as Schroeder noted, \u201cthe Ramban ... had the remarkably modern insight that at the moment after creation, all the matter in the universe must have been concentrated in a tiny speck.\u201d\u201d\u201d Tell me that this insight is not identical to that reached by Lemaitre? I hope no one will now think that I, personally, believe that Creation as described in Genesis is a veiled description of the Big Bang since, as I hope to demonstrate in a future work, Ihave an entirely different theory to propose concerning the shedding of light by",

It is one thing to hypothesize, but quite another to uphold the hypothesis\u2014at least Lemaitre had general relativity on which to rely. In this respect, David Leveson was shrewd enough to note: \u201cIn scientific as opposed to pseudo-scientific polemic, evidence has priority over hypothesis,\u201d adding that \u201chypothesis must conform to evidence, not evidence to hypothesis.\u201d And he goes on with: \u201cIf evidence contrary to a given hypothesis is found, the hypothesis must (or should) be altered or rejected.\u201d But then he was astute enough to warn that: \u201cThis does not mean that when contrary evidence is found the hypothesis is immediately rejected; it may be retained tentatively in the hope that further evidence may eventually explain the \u2018contrary\u2019 evidence in terms of the theory.\u201d\"\"* As he also pointed out: \u201cIndeed, many hypotheses are arrived at intuitively, through a \u2018flash of insight,\u2019 and may be maintained in the mind of the investigator in spite of much initial \u2018contrary\u2019 evidence, and later be vindicated ... But a legitimate researcher will not consciously suppress contrary evidence. Certainly he will not publish a hypothesis until he has satisfied himself that all the available evidence is in accord with it. Indeed, if he is properly conscientious, he will search for contrary evidence to test the validity of his ideas. Hypothesis may precede evidence in time but not in importance.\u201d\u201d\u201d These are guidelines that will be kept in mind as we attempt to unravel the lost history of our Solar System in the pages that follow. But, even so, the question must be asked: What constitutes evidence? As Daniel Trifiletti noted: \u201cThe very nature of evidence changes from one discipline of science to another. What is evidentiary to one person is excluded by another. Facts are not the same for every- one. Since we cannot all agree as to what constitute \u2018facts,\u2019 deductive arguments alone can never be fully convincing... \u201cThere is another approach, however, for assessing what might be considered \u2018dubious\u2019 by some. That recourse is inductive reasoning. Let it be recognized that no fact stands alone, but is part of a whole constellation of other facts. At some point, when enough facts have been collected, each individual point of light may be seen as part of a newly recognizable figure\u2014an organic whole. Eventually the sheer weight of even \u2018dubious\u2019 facts becomes too large to ignore.\u201d\u2122 THE HISTORICITY OF THE EVENTS Can it, however, be assumed that the events portrayed in myths have any factual basis one way or the other? Many a past mythologist has been vociferous in denying that any his- toricity can be discerned in mythic content. Most mythologists continue to believe that myth, on the one hand, deals with religious, that is moral, precepts presented in allegorical form, and, on the other hand, with such fabulous events that no scientifically-minded modern per- son can accept. Conrad Hyers, a professor of religion, to name but one, has written profusely",

In attempting to dissect the Old Testament Book of Genesis, he has stressed that \u201cthe authors were concerned with using these stories as instances of various theological and ethical truths.\u201d\u201d' As he had it stated, the \u201cprimary function of great myths and legends is not that of offering explanations;\u201d\u2122\u201d they \u201care not concerned with providing a miscellany of - information or ready-made answers.\u201d\u201d \u201cThey were,\u201d according to Hyers, \u201cunderstood as vehicles of the most basic and important truths of all by which people organized, regulated, and interpreted their lives, and through which they saw meaning, purpose, and value in their existence.\u201d \u201cMyths and legends,\u201d he goes on, \u201ctogether with rituals, provided the overar- ching frame of reference within which to live and experience and celebrate the world.\u2019\u201d\u2122 In a way, I could not have put it better myself. Where I disagree with him is when he states that \u201cto dwell on the historicity of the accounts, even only an historical core, is to stray from the purposes of the writings.\u201d He goes on with: \u201c[The accounts in Genesis] are not aimed at providing a \u2018truer\u2019 picture of the universe or of human history, let alone the only true picture, in the modern scientific or historical senses of true.\u201d\u201d\u201d Personally, I refuse to be dubbed a fundamentalist,\u201d but I must also state that Hyers\u2019 disclaimer is mainly due to the fact that he does not understand what historical truths lie hidden within the pages of Genesis, a work which will hold a place of great importance in the pages to follow. Mircea Eliade who, in his faltering way, has done more for comparative mythology than any other mythologist of the past, was of a slightly different opinion. To him, religious rites consisted in \u201cthe repetition of an archetypal action performed in illo tempore (before \u201chistory\u201d began) by ancestors or by gods ... \u201d\u201d \u201cBy its repetition, the act coincides with its archetype, and time is abolished. We are witnessing, so the speak, the same act that was performed in illo tempore, at the dawn of the universe.\u201d\u2122 Of course this depends on what one means by \u201chistory.\u201d If, by that term, one is to under- stand \u201cwritten history,\u201d then Eliade is correct. If, however, by \u201chistory\u201d we mean \u201cthe story of mankind,\u201d Eliade could not have been correct. This becomes of great importance when one considers what else Eliade had to say about this subject. Thus, toward the end of the work being cited, he states that: \u201cEvery ritual, and every meaningful act that man performs, repeats a mythical archetype; and ... this repetition involves the abolition of profane time and placing of man in a magico-religious time which has no connection with succession in the true sense, but forms the \u2018eternal now\u2019 of mythical time.

But note that the majority of myths, simply because they record what took place \u2018in illo tempore,\u2019 themselves constitute an exemplar history for the human society in which they have been preserved, and for the world that society lives in. Even the cosmogonic myth is history, for it recounts all that took place ab origine; but we must, I need hardly say, remember that it is not \u2018history\u2019 in our sense of the word\u2014things that took place once and will never take place again ... \u201d\u2122\" Despite the fact that I shall be relying heavily on Eliade\u2019s scholarly insights in the pages that follow, it is precisely here that I must part company with him because, as | aim to illus- trate, the events narrated in myth did take place. They took place not \u201coutside history,\u201d as he maintained, but within history. And by \u201chistory\u201d I do mean \u201c\u2018history\u2019 in our sense of the word.\u201d Moreover, Eliade claimed that even the cosmogonic myth is history, whereas I main- tain that all myth is cosmogonic in origin. The \u201chistory\u201d / am speaking of, therefore, is a cosmogonic history, one that unfurled across the sky and touched Earth and its inhabitants with a mighty finger that has left the human psyche scarred unto this day. The events that the major myths of the world narrate actually took place, and they took place very much in the way the myths narrate. What, then, is myth? I cannot for the life of me remember who said it, but someone, somewhere, once stated that myth constitutes the fossilized memory of man. Truer words have rarely been spoken. But this fossilized memory betokens a knowledge, a remembrance, of what once took place in heaven and, in that respect, it can safely be stated that myth constitutes the history of the Solar System. Here I can best illustrate the above by repeating a story that was well known to the an- cient Greeks. The story involves the god Helios\u2014usually identified as the personification of the Sun*\u2019\u2014who was believed to drive his flaming chariot across the sky. When, once, He- lios told his son Phaethon that he could ask him for any boon, Phaethon replied by asking to be allowed to drive his father\u2019s chariot. At first Helios, repenting of his oath, tried to dissuade Phaethon by stressing the dangers involved in driving the chariot. But, when Phaethon in- sisted, Helios, having given his word, was left with no recourse but to give in to his son. Phaethon, still in the pride of his youth, leaped into the chariot, took reins in hand, and began on his journey. The steeds drawing the chariot, however, felt that the weight they were carry- ing was too light and they leaped into the air as if the car was empty. This occasioned them to leave their usual well-beaten path, and Phaethon, who lacked his father\u2019s expertise, panicked, and, in trying to correct his erroneous course across the sky, pulled this way and that way at the reins, confusing the horses further. Losing control of the chariot, Phaethon ended up driving it too close to Earth with the result that Earth\u2019s moisture was dried up by the heat of the chariot and, in due course, Earth caught fire and came close to being annihilated by the conflagration. In the end, Zeus himself was forced to intervene. Sending forth one of his ter- rible thunderbolts, he smote Phaethon with its might, shattering the chariot and freeing the horses. The fragments of the wrecked car were scattered and Phaethon himself, with flames",

It was on the way from the airport that Peiser first in- formed us of the above revelation. He also told us, however, that while astronomers had come around to seriously consider terrestrial catastrophism as having possibly been caused by asteroidal and cometary impacts, they were still adamant in their denial concerning the possibility of planetary catastrophism within the historical, and man\u2019s prehistoric, past. Not only that, Peiser, who seems to have no use for planetary catastrophism himself, also warned us that the persistence of belief in planetary \u201cbilliards\u201d can only prove a hindrance to the eventual acceptance of cosmic catastrophism. Peiser sees this face-about by astronomers and their allies as a positive step forward. As I told him then, unless planetary catastrophism was also to be embraced as a valid possibility, at best the step in question can only be seen as be- ing sideways. The present state of affairs was uniquely displayed at the Second SIS Cambridge Confer- ence, held in July 1997 at Fitzwilliam College, in Cambridge, in which the work of the as- tronomers Victor Clube and Bill Napier received quite a boost. Having kept the astronomical part of their cosmic scenario well within the bounds of accepted paradigms, not much can be",

In fact, as far as their book, The Cosmic Serpent, is concerned, it can safely be stated that they relied quite heavily on Immanuel Velikovsky\u2019s Worlds in Collision. Of course, Velikovsky dealt in plan- etary catastrophism, whereas Clube and Napier re-interpreted Velikovsky\u2019s mytho-historical sources in light of cometary bombardments. They could not, of course, escape the fact that the sources themselves stress the role of planets in lieu of comets. They got around this by the supposition that planets were named as the perpetrators in lieu of comets because the comets had first appeared close to the planets and thus received planetary names. Even so, the sudden interest in cosmic catastrophism among establishment science was not influenced by the work of Clube, Napier, Velikovsky, or any of their predecessors in the field, but was largely due to the insights derived from three separate events\u2014one ancient, the other two recent. The ancient event concerns the demise of the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous period (the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, actually) due to the terrestrial impact of a celestial body, which was first proposed by de Laubenfels in 1956,\u2122 twenty four years before the team headed by Luis Alvarez stole the credit for the hypothesis. At first described as \u201ca nutty theory of pseudoscientists posing as paleontologists,\u201d\u2122 the proposal has now gained general acceptance. Even so, because this event is supposed to have transpired mil- lions of years ago, it did not do much toward the gaining of respectability by cosmic catas- trophism. In that respect, neither did the terrestrial impact of a heavenly bolide in the Tun- guska region of Siberia, which occurred on the morning of June 30, 1908, exploding in a blinding flash and flattening twenty-five square miles of the surrounding forest, since this, too, was considered an isolated case. Although the warning should have been clear, the event did not attract much attention in the Western World until the late decades of the century. It was, more than anything else, the most recent of these events, when Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, which had broken up into a train of twenty-one separate fragments, smashed into Jupiter during the month of July in 1994. Had there been a slight deviation in the comet\u2019s orbit, all twenty one pieces could have plowed into Earth. But even with this terrestrial miss, it be- came painfully apparent that if a comet can smash into a nearby member of the Solar System, another one could just as easily collide with Earth. All of a sudden there was a flurry of activity among astronomers centered on the detec- tion, and possible elimination, of Earth-crossing objects, while geologists have gone wild in their attempt to discover previously unrecognized impact scars in our terrestrial terrain. His- torians began pouring over historical, pseudo-historical, and mytho-historical documents in the hope of discovering records of possible past impacts, while archaeologists started re- sifting the dust of ages to see what they might have missed among the scattered ruins of past civilizations that might be interpreted as cometary, or asteroidal, destruction. So that, in a manner of speaking, the writing of this book does not exactly place me in bad company\u2014but only in a manner of speaking. Comets plowing into Earth remain a far cry from planets shifting on their orbits\u2014that is if these shifts are maintained to have transpired during the advent of man on Earth. As pointed out above, it was because of the supposed impossibility of such orbital shifts that the astronomers Clube and Napier thought it expedient to re-interpret the mytho-historical record in a cometary light, claiming that planets were named in the ancient records simply because comets had appeared in close proximity to the planets and thus were given planetary names. And, to be fair, this is not exactly a spurious idea. Thus the Greeks were wont to refer to",

        "main_text": "+ Chapter 2 Ancient Astronomical Lore SACRED IMAGES FROM THE SKY here will be some who might object that ancient civilizations had enough knowledge of astronomical matters, so that one could not really accept whatever they had to say concerning the planets of the Solar System as being accurate. Such an objection would, however, be based on ignorance since the various civilizations whose mytho-historical re- cords we will soon be examining were actually quite knowledgeable when it came to obser- vational astronomy. A detailed exploration of this ancient astronomical lore would constitute a book of its own. Thus, despite the length of this chapter, what is presented below consti- tutes only a brief account of the major astronomical discoveries made by our ancient forefa- thers. I will start with a topic that might be considered mundane\u2014meteors and meteorites. These had been falling from the sky since time immemorial. Our primitive forebears would not have been strangers to such falls. And, unlike the deification of planets, the sanctification of meteorites is more understandable. Meteors do not appear merely as pin-points of light in the night sky. Even when they do, as shooting stars they leave a short-lived luminous streak in their wake. Every so often, veritable showers of these streaky flares seem to radiate from a local spot in the sky. When conditions permit, such showers can be quite impressive. More rarely, meteors roar in the shape of terrible fire balls through the sky, night or day. Their ex- plosive impact on the ground can be quite a frightening experience. Such events, when wit- nessed, must have awed our primitive ancestors. The occurrences would have been remem- bered with fear and even reverence. Depending on conditions, an impacting meteor may or may not form a crater. The meteor itself may be burned and atomized in its passage through Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Often enough, stony chunks or masses of iron remain on the ground as evidence of the bombardment. The arrival, or apparent materialization, of such objects in places where fire balls were seen to strike must have mystified primitive man to no little extent. Such objects, when found, would have been thought to be magical, possessing benign or evil powers, if not both. It is under- standable that such objects, now known as meteorites, would have been collected, preserved, and even revered. But we find that there was more than that. Lincoln La Paz put it succinctly when he wrote: \u201cThe ancients supposed the stars to be the domicile of gods; falling stars and falling meteorites signified to them either the actual descent of a god or the sending of his image to earth.\u201d! The worship of meteorites\u201d as images of the gods, however, could only have accrued from a prior belief that the gods resided in the sky in the form of stars. Thus, if stars were",

One thing to note here is that it can thus be seen that the ancients were well aware of the phenomenon. The Babylonians referred to meteors as Kakkabu rabu.\u2019 This recognition, how- ever, did not keep the ancient peoples of the Near East from attributing sanctity to meteorites. Nor did it keep them from identifying them as images or pre-existing deities.* Among the Semites, especially the ancient inhabitants of the Arabian peninsula, stones were frequently credited with divine attributes.* These cults, as Hildegard Lewy indicated,\u00b0 were practiced by the same people who worshipped the visible planets. Philo Byblius tells us that the Phoenicians considered meteorites as \u201cstars fallen from the air,\u201d and that these played a dominant role in the religion of his ancient forebears.\u2019 These meteorites, as Lewy stressed, \u201cwere conceived as divine beings of exactly the same nature as the planets.\u201d* A meteorite which fell at Tyre, in Syria, was associated with the goddess Astarte.\u201d What is of additional interest here is that, according to those very Phoenicians who venerated her, Astarte was the same as the Greek Aphrodite\u2019 and, therefore, like her, the goddess of the planet Venus. According to a passage in the New Testament, one of the sacred images that was wor- shipped at Ephesus, and associated with Artemis/Diana, was believed to have fallen from the planet Jupiter.\" The Syrian cultists of the god Elegabalus (or Gabal) \u201cfocused their worship on a meteorite at the shrine of Emesa.\u201d\u201d A large, conical, black stone, this \u201cimage\u201d was later transported by the emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, who assumed the name of his god, to the temple of Kybele in Rome.\u201d Another famous meteorite which was held as sacred in this region was the Magna Mater at Pessinus, in Asia Minor.\"* Worthy of mention was also the stone which fell at Abydos and was worshipped there. \u00b0 According to the Egyptian priest Manetho, as quoted by Plutarch, the Egyptians consid- ered lodestones to be the bones of the god Horus, while iron, in general, was believed to be the bones of Set (which Plutarch rendered as Typhon).'\u00b0 Meteorites were venerated not only in honor of Set but also in honor of the great god Amon\u201d whom the Greeks, rightly or wrongly, identified with their own Zeus,\u201d and the Romans, quite naturally, with Jupiter. The ancients were so well acquainted with meteorites that, before its discovery as an ore in the bowels of the Earth, they were of the belief that all iron fell from the sky. Thus the",

In Egypt, the association of meteoric iron with the gods, and especially with the evil god Set, seems to have led to a taboo against the use of the metal.* A similar religious taboo is also known to have existed in ancient Israel. The Old Testament preaches against the use of iron tools in the construction of Yahweh\u2019s altar.\u201d The taboo against the use of iron was also ob- served in Greek and Roman cults.\u201d A religious ex- ception seems to have been allowed in Egyptian fu- nerary rites. \u201cMetal of heaven\u201d was used in the manu- facture of small symbolic instruments in connection with the rites of the dead and such items were often interred with the deceased. These religious instru- ments are mentioned in the Egyptian prayers for the dead even though, because of the corrosive nature of iron, few of them have ever been retrieved.\u201d Meteorites were also worshipped in Greece. Con- cerning this practice, Pausanias wrote: \u201cOrchomenos has a sanctuary of Dionysos, but the most ancient one is consecrated to the Graces.

As G. A. Wainwright wrote in 1936: \u201cPlenty of [other meteorites] could be mentioned as being kept in churches or tem- ples, but let that of Casa Grande suffice. It was found in a room of an ancient Mexi- can temple carefully swathed in bandages.\u201d Let not the reader delude himself into thinking that such beliefs and practices were merely the result of ancient and/or primitive naivet\u00e9. Modern-day Moslems might not care to admit it, but the most holy object in all of Islam, the Black Stone, which today is incorpo- rated into the Ka\u2019aba at Mecca, is also a meteorite. Here it is only fair to point out that Immanuel Velikovsky\u2019s claim that the Black Stone was believed to have fallen from the planet Venus\u00ae cannot be substantiated. Even so, there seems to be no doubt that the Black Stone \u201chad streaked out of the heavens one night in the forgotten past,\u201d and that it is nothing but a meteorite.\u201d There has been some speculation that this meteorite had originally been reddish in hue and that its present black color is simply due to the patina of ages.* To my knowledge, this has never been ascertained. In fact there is reason to believe that the Stone\u2019s blackness coin- cided with a special characteristic of mythic significance. That the Ka\u2019aba was originally a shrine to the god and planet Saturn has now been docu- mented.\u201d Also, the myths and astronomical lore of various nations connect the color black with this very planet and its deity.\u00a9 As Hildegard Lewy pointed out, \u201cSaturn is frequently called the \u2018black\u2019 or \u2018dark\u2019 planet.\u201d It is this particular Saturnian curiosity that points to the Black Stone\u2019s selection as a Saturnian symbol.

Having done so, he concluded that nothing of the sort could have tran- spired and that all those who were said to have witnessed the event had either been mistaken or lying.\u201d The reasoning was simple: As that indomitable arch-enemy of establishment sci- ence, Charles Fort, put it, since there were no stones in the sky to start with, no stones could have fallen from the sky.* Because of such episodes, many European museums ended up discarding genuine mete- orites, which would have been of great benefit to the scientific world in later years, simply because they thought of them \u201cas shameful relics of a superstitious past.\u201d\u201d One meteorite from that era, however, was preserved \u201cdue to the protection given to it by the bishop of Zagreb\u2019s consistory.\u201d This was the iron meteorite which had fallen at Hraschina in 1751. Sworn statements by eye-witnesses were collected and, together with the iron fragment, were sent to the Austrian emperor. Eventually, both the documents and the meteorite came into the possession of the Vienna museum and the attention of the physicist E. F. F. Chladni who commenced on a battle against the scientific establishment. In his paper of 1794, Chladni de- fended the trustworthiness of the Hraschina and other meteorites and was bold enough to claim that these objects originated as cosmic debris which had penetrated Earth\u2019s atmosphere and fallen to the ground. Most of his colleagues, however, remained skeptical.\u201d But then, in 1803, so many of the damned things fell and landed on the ground\u2014an entire shower of meteorites actually\u2014that the new investigator, Jean Baptiste Biot, had no option but to accept their extraterrestrial origin. Even so, when, in 1807, two Yale scientists claimed that meteorites had recently struck the ground at Weston, Connecticut, disbelief was still rampant. Thus, when Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States, \u201cwho included palaeontology among his many interests,\u201d was told of the incident, he is reported to have re- plied that: \u201cIt is easier to believe that two Yankee professors would lie, than that stones would fall from heaven.\u201d * There is a lesson to be learned here because, since the ancients, who had been reporting the fall of such objects, swaddling them, worshipping them, etcetera, have been proven right on this score, they should perhaps be given the benefit of the doubt concerning their reports of other astronomical occurrences which science has not yet had reason to accept as being valid. CALENDARS The Mesoamerican Indians have gained the reputation of having been one of the most astronomically-oriented peoples of the ancient world. This is stressed here because the unini- tiated has a tendency to perceive the Mesoamerican Indians as having been a primitive tribe of people, adorned in colorful costumes and exotic feathered headdresses, whose brutal re- ligion incorporated human sacrifice on a massive scale. Other than their description as primi- tive, the above holds true. But these Indians had also been capable of constructing monu-",

Among the Maya, the priests were the ones who normally acted as the keepers of scien- tific knowledge, including that branch we today would call astronomy. It was not, however, merely the priesthood which was obsessed with such lore but, as Juan de Torquemada re- corded a century after the Spanish conquest of Mexico, even kings. Of Netzahualpilli, the king of Texcoco, he had this to report: \u201cThey say he was a great astrologer and prided himself much on his knowledge of the motions of the celestial bodies; and being attached to this study, that he caused in- quiries to be made throughout the entire extent of his dominions, for all such persons as were at all conversant with it, whom he brought to his court, and imparted to them whatever he knew, and ascending by night on the terraced roof of his palace, he thence considered the stars, and disputed with them all on difficult questions con- nected with them.\u201d* It is obvious from the pictorial elements included in various codices that pyramid-tem- ples, as well as other structures, were utilized as astronomical observation posts. One of these codices even shows a priest stationed in a temple doorway, peering through a cross-piece to observe a celestial event. In fact, the symbol of an eye located within, or in conjunction with, such cross-pieces appear on other codices which treat of astronomical matters, thus indicat- ing that this simple instrument was the one most frequently used in astronomical observa- tions. Granted, most, although not all, of Mesoamerican astronomical knowledge is calendric in nature. It might therefore be countered that, since calendars are the outcome of solar and lu- nar motions, one should not be all that impressed with their knowledge. After all, as complex as they are, the motions of the Sun and the Moon are more observable than the fall of mete- orites. The computation of such systems is not, however, all that easily determined. After all, the calendar we presently use in the Western World was not computed until 1582. The Mesoamericans\u2019 mathematical abilities, especially when it came to the calculation of time-periods and, quite naturally, the formulation of calendars (of which they possessed more than one), formed the dictatorial power that held sway over Maya life. The vigesimal system they employed\u2014that is, a progression by twenties rather than by tens as in our decimal sys- tem\u2014enabled them to conduct complex calculations in their studies of astronomical phe- nomena. They understood, and utilized, the concept of zero a thousand years before Europe- ans did. They learned how to accurately predict eclipses and were able to tabulate the mo- tions of the planet Venus with a precision that has stunned modern astronomers. The Dresden Codex, for example, gives a total of 11,960 days for 405 lunar cycles which, when compared to the modern value of 11,959.89 days, discloses an error of only one day every 380 years.* I will not here tax the reader\u2019s patience with a detailed scrutiny of Mesoamerican calen- dars with all their complex calculations. Even so, a brief survey would not be amiss.",

In this respect, the Mesoamericans were no different. They, too, were enticed with the observation of the Pleiades. Known to European observers as the Seven Sisters, this group of stars received considerable attention all over the world. As Anthony Aveni informs us: \u201cThe Sherente of Brazil still use the Pleiades today to mark the seasons. They say that the year commences in June when the Pleiades first appear as the sun leaves the con- stellation of Taurus...The Navajo dignify the Pleiades by associating them with their principal deity, Black God, creator of fire and light. In fact, a recognizable form of this group appears on the face of Black God. \u201cThe Aztecs determined the occurrence of their most important feast day by the ap- pearance of the Pleiades. According to Sahagiin, the ceremony of the Binding of the Years took place every fifty-two years and began when the Pleiades transited the ze- nith at midnight...\u201d* As we have already noted, Saturn was known as the black god and/or black planet among various peoples of the ancient world. I therefore feel confident that the Navajo Black God mentioned by Aveni in the quote above will be found to have originally been a personifica- tion of the same planet.

As Guy Anequin tells us: \u201cTheir measurements...were based entirely on sighting, calculations of triangulation and measurement of the movements of shadows. They observed that the stars, and in particular the sun, were seen at different angles according to the time of the year. They also noted that daily hours of sunlight varied from one day to another according to these positions \u2014they thus strove to locate the solstices, the extreme solar positions for the longest and the shortest days of the year. For this, they probably used a gno- mon, a kind of sight made with only a vertical rod. The shadow on the ground at mid- day on June 21 (the summer solstice) was shortest, while at midday on December 21 (the winter solstice) was the longest. The various sightings taken at sunrise from a fixed point will give a different angle throughout the year\u2014for in winter the sun rises further to the south and in summer further to the north on the eastern horizon... \u201cScrutiny of the night sky must have been no less important than that of day.

The Evening Star Venus, with its irregular course, the first to appear and the last to fade, caught their eye. The Maya strived [sic.] to measure its height which varies at sunrise and sun- set...All of these preoccupations, which went far beyond those required to compile an agrarian calendar, showed their obsessive interest in infinity \u2014 whether of time or space\u2014and also an anxiety in the face of the passage of time.\u201d The astronomical observations of the Maya were so precise that the figures they arrived at in computing the solar year were not only more accurate than the Julian year, but, as some have claimed, also more accurate than the Gregorian year which was introduced into Europe in 1582 and remains the calendar year until the present.\u201d Mesoamerican calendars were not produced by any one person in any single generation. Their development and refinement was the product of centuries. In fact, their basic elements can be traced as far back as the Olmec, who had established their cities and ceremonial cen- tres in Mexico\u2019s Gulf Coast \u201cat least as early as the second century B. C.\u201d\" In time\u2014pun not intended\u2014these calendars evolved into an intricate system in which several different time cycles, all of which were calculated independently and with similar exactitude, were incorpo- rated in various combinations, relating one cycle to another, in their utilization of time meas- urement.\u201d One particular calendar employed by the Maya, called Haab, was based on a 360-day count and was divided into 18 months of 20 days each, to which five days\u2014believed to be \u201cmalefic, ill-omened, empty, and nameless\u201d*\u2014were added at the end to bring the year to a total of 365 days. While the 365-day calendar, which in time became the common property of all Mesoamerican peoples, has been attested in inscriptions as early as 667 B.C.,* Edmonson tells us that the 360-day calendar did not come into use by the Olmecs earlier than the first century B.C.,\u00ae that is some 300 years after the inauguration of the 365-day one. I mention this here in passing because, if Edmonson is correct, Immanuel Velikovsky\u2019s contention that the 365-day calendar followed the 360-day one\u00ae has to be wrong. A somewhat simpler, but more mysterious, calendar, said to have been called Tzolkin by the Maya, but Tonalamatl by the Aztecs, was composed of 260 days divided into 13 months of 20 days each. Usually referred to as the sacred calendar because it was used to keep the religious festivals in line with the proper seasons, the Tzolkin has been demoted to a mere divinatory program by students of Mesoamerican culture.\u201d More recently, Vincent Malmstr\u00e9m has attempted to show that this 260-day calendar was actually even older than the Maya. Said to have been originally developed for agrarian pur- poses, Malmstr\u00e9m contends that this calendar owed its origin to the Zoque of Mexico\u2019s Pa- cific coastal plain and that it marks the interval between passages of the Sun at its zenith over",

Developed in the fourteenth century B.C., the calen- dar passed on to the Olmec of the Gulf Coast and, from there, to the Maya in the east and the plateau of Mexico in the west.\u00ae Whether Malmstrom has come across a red herring, and/or whether Mayanists will ever accept his conclusions, as of this writing remains to be seen. One thing that can be stated for certain is that the synchronization of this calendar with the 360-day one occurred once every 18,980 days, which makes for 52 years.\u00ae This is the same time period we have already encountered as separating the ceremony known as the Binding of the Years which began at the midnight transit of the Pleiades constellation. The Mesoamericans also devised a lunar calendar which fitted into their other time- keeping devices. The lunar r period of 29.53 days that they obtained contained a mere discrep- ancy of only .112 of a day. The Dresden Codex not only includes the perpetual lunar calendar mentioned above, but also a table of new moons to be used for the prediction of solar eclipses.\u201d VENUS Of all the celestial bodies that the Mesoamericans observed, the planet Venus seems without doubt to have been considered the most important. Called, among other things, the Great, or Ancient, Star, it is repeatedly alluded to in the extant codices. Ram\u00e9n y Zamora, who studied the lore of the Mexican tribes only a few decades after the re-discovery of America, was astounded to discover that the Indians kept a precise record of the appearances of this planet. \u201cSo accurately did they keep the record of the days when it appeared and dis- appeared,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat they never made a mistake.\u201d\u201d Toribo Motolina added that \u201cthey knew on what day it would appear again in the east after it had lost itself or disappeared in the west\u201d and that \u201cthey counted the days by this star and yielded reverence and offered sac- rifices to it.\u201d\u201d The Dresden Codex of the Maya includes a complete record of the apparition of this planet in its cycle from Morning to Evening Star, recorded in the dot and bar mathematical symbols which they employed (in which a dot signifies 1, and a bar stands for 5, with an oval\u2014a stylized seashell, really\u2014for the concept of zero). Intervals indicating the elapsed time between successive heliacal risings are there recorded. This interval of time was calcu- lated by them as a period of 584 days which the Maya subdivided into four subintervals: the appearance of the planet as Morning Star; its appearance as Evening Star; its disappearance in front of the Sun; and its disappearance behind the Sun.\u2122 Venus takes 224.7 days to complete one circuit around the Sun. As seen from Earth, however, it appears to take 583.92 days to complete one circuit. This is because Earth, too, is moving in the same direction. This apparent time-span is known as the synodic period. As noted above, the Mesoamericans calculated the Venerian synodic year as 584 days,\u201d which, when compared to the modern value of 583.92 days, discloses an error of less than one hour",

It is easily forgotten by the layman that one cannot easily view the Sun directly without some form of optic protection except during its risings and settings. Of course, it could also be argued that the Chinese, who were so adept at just about everything, could have utilized dark, or smoked, glass in order to enable them to view sunspots. Actually, not even a smoked glass would have been necessary. Despite the fact that the Sun cannot be viewed directly for any length of time with the un- aided eye, it can be viewed indirectly when it is shielded by haze or thin clouds. As John Gribbin noted, it is hardly surprising that those Chinese records which mention sunspots \u201cvery often comment at the same time that the brightness of the Sun was reduced.\u201d As Gribbin explained: \u201cThis does not imply that the Sun itself was dim, but that dust or haze in the atmosphere was obscuring its light and making it possible to pick out the spots against the glare of the solar disk.\u201d\u00ae Had sunspots been as easily detected with the unaided eye as some would think, it would not, in Europe, have taken till the early seventeenth century for them to be re-discovered. One of the reasons why Galileo was persecuted by the Catholic Church was his insistence that the Sun often exhibits such blemishes on its surface. Prior to that, one of the central dogmas of the Church was that the Sun, having been created by God, had to be a perfect sphere. \u201c[S]uggesting imperfection in the Sun was seen in some quarters as implying that God could be fallible and was guilty of shoddy workmanship.\u201d\u201d\u201d And yet, even before the Chinese, sunspots had long been known to the ancient Greeks. THE ETERNAL PLANET The caliber of ancient Chinese astronomy can inter alia be judged by what the imperial astronomers were able to discover about the planets. Here I do not wish to bore the lay reader with too many technicalities, so I will merely zero in on what the Chinese had to say con- cerning the planet Saturn, the astronomical name of which was T\u2019ien-Sing, which means \u201cEternal Planet.\u201d The slowness of this body in its course around the Sun, for instance, was described by them in this manner: \u201cThis planet, with its slow and heavy walk, imitating age, drags itself along its path, in a manner of speaking; before finishing its revolution, it had seen a great number of men die whom it had seen being born, so slow was its pace.\u201d\u00ae",

The apparent stoppage and temporary retrograde motion of Saturn along its orbit, which applies to all outer planets\u2014that is, those farther away from the Sun than Earth, and therefore outside Earth\u2019s orbit\u2014an illusion brought about when Earth overtakes it in its narrower cir- cuit, was also calculated by them.\u201d As Gustave Schlegel pointed out, the modern value for this apparent motion \u201cmore or less agrees with the Chinese observation.\u201d\u201d And similarly for the other planets visible to the naked eye. GUEST STARS One particular branch of ancient astronomy that can be said to have been uniquely Chi- nese was the record-keeping of what they termed \u201cGuest Stars.\u201d These records documented the temporary blaze of stellar \u201cexplosions,\u201d or flare-ups, which bring usually invisible stars to bright perceptibility, an effulgence which persists for a specific, but not usually long, time, before it wanes and the star again disappears from view. Having once been referred to as \u201cnew stars,\u201d these stellar phenomena are now known as novae and supernovae. The most fa- mous of such temporary Chinese Guest Stars was the one that took place in 1054 A.D., a su- pernova that is now believed to have given birth to the Crab Nebula. THE SURYA SIDDHANTA Of Hindu astronomical knowledge I will say nothing beyond a few facts as contained in the Surya Siddhanta which, among other matters, presents the correct view that Earth is a sphere. As it is there written: \u201cAnd everywhere upon the globe of the earth, men think their own place to be uppermost\u2014 but since it is a globe in the ether, where should there be an up- per, or where an under side of it?\u201d* Aryabhatta even held the opinion that Earth revolves on its axis. One should read the section of the Surya Siddhanta which treats of planetary conjunc- tions, that is the apparent contact of one planet with another as seen with the naked eye against the background of stars, in order to obtain some measure of understanding concerning the painstaking observations and calculations that these early astronomers were capable of. A different term is there employed for different conjunctions.* These apparent close ap- proaches of planets were correctly understood in a purely angular sense\u2014that is, they were quite aware that the planets appeared to touch each other only when they happened to lie in the same line of sight as seen from Earth.\u201d Velikovsky was thus completely in error when he proposed that these conjunctions re- ferred to actual physical contacts between planets.\u201d This is evidenced by the work in ques-",

Thibaut has claimed that much of what is found contained in the Hindu Siddhantas, of which there is more than one, is mainly based on the teachings of the Greek Hipparchos and/or Ptolemy. Otto Neugebauer and D. Pingree also trace some of this Hindu knowledge to the even older Babylonians. We therefore turn next to Greece and, after that, to Babylon. THE ALMAGEST Claudius Ptolemaeus, popularly known simply as Ptolemy, was the most celebrated geog- rapher, mathematician, and astronomer prior to medieval times. More than that, he has often been referred to as \u201cthe greatest astronomer of antiquity.\u201d Unfortunately, despite some Arabian traditions concerning his personal appearance and the report that he lived to the ripe old age of 78 years, nothing much is known about the man himself. Whether his name, Ptolemaeus, derived from that of the Greek city in which he was said to have been born, Ptolemais Hermii, or whether, as Kenneth Heuer assumes, it \u201cindicates that he was an in- habitant of Egypt of Greek or Macedonian [that is, Ptolemaic] descent,\u201d cannot now be as- certained. What seemed to have been certain until recently is that he conducted his astronomical ob- servations at Alexandria, in Egypt, sometime during the years 127 and 141 or 151 A.D. The belief among more modern historians of science, however, is that Ptolemy conducted most of his observing \u201cnot at night on the coast of Egypt but during the day in the great library at Al- exandria, where he appropriated the work of a Greek astronomer [Hipparchus] and proceeded to call it his own.\u201d Of his works on geography and mathematics, I shall say nothing here, concentrating in- stead, and then only briefly, on his astronomical observations and theories. These were pre- sented in thirteen books originally titled Syntaxis, but later referred to by the Arabs as Al- magest, which means \u201cThe Greatest,\u201d the name by which the work is now more commonly alluded to. For better or worse, this work \u201cwas accepted as the final authority on the subject until it was superseded by the observations of the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus in the 16th century.\u201d\"\u201d What Ptolemy concluded from his so-called observations of the heavens was that the heavenly bodies moved in circular orbits and that Earth, already known by then to be spheri- cal in shape, was at the centre of the universe. He calculated the periods of revolution, as well as the apparent retrogradation, of the five planets visible to the unaided eye, the inclination of their orbits, and their motions in latitude. He compiled a catalogue of the stars visible in both the northern and southern hemispheres, listed under constellations, giving their apparent magnitudes, latitudes, and longitudes, which stars numbered 1,022 (some say 1,025) as compared with the 850 or so that were contained in the earlier catalogue of Hipparchus. Much of the Almagest is taken up with an explanation of astronomical assumptions and mathematical methods; the length of the year and the motion of the Sun; the length of the month and the motions of the Moon; the sizes and distances of the Sun, the Moon, and Earth itself; eclipses of the Sun and the Moon; and the precession of the equinoxes.",

Let not the reader, however, disqualify Ptolemy as an incompetent astronomer because of his astrological beliefs. Isaac Newton was not only a be- liever in alchemy, he himself attempted to change base metals into silver and gold. '\u00ae As Heuer informed his readers, \u201cPtolemy was not the kind of genius who produced new ideas; he took existing ideas and changed and extended them in order to obtain agreement with observed facts.\u201d\u2122 There is no doubt, however, that a large part of the theories he presents are his own contributions \u201cbased on observations of his own, not to speak of the unbelievable number of numerical calculations which underlie the tables of the Almagest.\u201d\"\u00ae Some of Ptolemy\u2019s modern defenders have been claiming that his \u201csystem\u201d has been much misunderstood by astronomers as well as historians of astronomy. As Irving Wolfe pointed out: \u201c...the theory of Ptolemy was not presented in its time as a real picture of the sky. Astrophysicist Bruce Gregory reminds us that Ptolemy\u2019s model was not said to be a miniature of the Solar System, as we use the word today. It was \u2018a device for calculating the position of the planets, not a device for representing the appearance of the planets.\u2019 Astonishingly, the theory of Copernicus was first presented in the same way, as a system which \u2018might not be the true scheme of nature, but merely a mathematical fiction which fitted the observations.\u2019'\u201d Ptolemy\u2019s system, however, was soon elevated to absolute truth, as was Copernicus\u2019 later, so it is we who have made them into religions.\u201d '\u00ae Maybe so, even though, to me, this sounds more like an attempt to whitewash Ptolemy\u2019s image. Thus, for instance, those astronomers who have more recently re-examined Ptolemy\u2019s original data soon realized that retrocalculations of the planets proved that many of Ptolemy\u2019s so-called observations were wrong. \u201cThe errors were gross even by the standards of ancient astronomy.\u201d There is also no longer any doubt that Ptolemy plagiarized the work of the earlier Hipparchus. We have already noted the earlier star catalogue compiled by Hipparchus who conducted his observations from the island of Rhodes. This Greek island lies five degrees of latitude north of Alexandria. This makes for a five-degree band of southern stars that can be seen from Alexandria but not from Rhodes. Not a single one of the 1,022 stars that Ptolemy listed in his catalogue is to be found in this five-degree band. Moreover, \u201cevery example given in the Almagest of how to work out spherical astronomy problems is given for a latitude the same as that of Rhodes.\u201d!\u201d Robert Newton went even further:",

Despite Owen Gingerich\u2019s claim that the geocentric world view \u201cwas almost universally accepted in his day,\u201d\"* when Ptolemy presented Earth as the centre of the universe with the planets revolving around it, he was rejecting what had al- ready been deduced before his time. Having considered the heliocentric system advocated by his forebears, he disqualified it since the implied violent rotation of Earth as deduced from Aristotle\u2019s physics seemed to Ptolemy to be contrary to observation. The way he reasoned was that Earth\u2019s rotation would have left \u201cthe animals and other weights...hanging in the air.\u201d Earth itself, he reasoned, \u201cwould very quickly fall out of the heavens.\u201d As he stated: \u201cMerely to conceive such things makes them appear ridiculous.\u201d As Carl Sagan correctly noted, in rejecting the earlier belief that the planets revolved around the Sun, Ptolemy was responsible for preventing \u201cthe advance of astronomy for a millennium.\u201d' Thus, Robert Newton may not have been too harsh in his judgement when he claimed that Ptolemy \u201chas caused us to lose much of the genuine work in Greek astronomy\u201d and that it would have been better for astronomy had the Almagest never been written.\" What, then, was this ancient Greek astronomy that Ptolemy sought to supersede? How superior was it to that espoused by Ptolemy? THE HELIOCENTRIC SYSTEM Many an authority on the subject of ancient Greek astronomy has in years past stressed the primitive nature of their knowledge. Many of them have relied on the oft-repeated dictum that \u201cthe world according to Homer\u201d consisted of a round, but flat, Earth overarched by a semi-spherical sky in which the gods had fashioned their various domains. But even as early as 1881, apparently to the unconcern of various authorities who came after him, Simon New- comb had already warned against this erroneous belief. As he wrote: \u201cNot enough credit has been given to the ancient astronomers. For instance, there was no time within the scope of history when it was not known that the earth is a sphere, and that the direction down at different points is toward the same point at the earth\u2019s centre. Current teaching in the text-books as to the knowledge of astronomy by the ancients is at fault.\u201d\"\u00b0 The discovery that the Sun, rather than Earth, was the body at the center of the Solar System has for long been attributed to the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Koppernigk, popularly known as Copernicus (1473-1543). It is sometimes forgotten that the Greek astronomer,",

For that reason, Heuer thought it appropriate to call Aristarchus \u201cthe ancient Copernicus.\u201d'\u201d Personally, giving credit where it is really due, I would rather turn that around by calling Copernicus \u201cthe modern Aristarchus.\u201d Copernicus himself was not only aware that Aristarchus had preceded him in the discovery, he actually ad- mitted to the fact in a passage of his work. Wishing to retain the fame for himself, however, he had _ second thoughts and ended up by excising all mention of Aristarchus in his published version. To be sure, the work in which Aris- tarchus proposed this hypothesis has not survived, but the hypothesis itself was well known and commented upon by other writers. For instance, in The Psammites (or Sand Reckoner), Ar- chimedes had it stated: \u201cBut Aristarchus of Samos brought out a book consisting of some hypotheses, in which the premises lead to the result that the universe is many times greater than that now called. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun in the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit...\u201d\"\"\" Granted that the great Plato (427-348 B.C.) had himself placed Earth in the centre of the universe, it seems as if even he had a change of mind. According to Plutarch (A.D. 46-120), Theophrastus had it stated that, when he had grown old, Plato repented \u201cthat he had placed the earth in the middle of the universe, which was not its place.\u201d'\u201d Actually, the belief in a heliocentric system seems to have originated not even with Aris- tarchus, but with Herakleides Ponticus (Heracleides of Pontus) who died in 322 B.C.\u2014we do not know when he was born. The same idea was also advanced much later by Macrobius (A.D. 395-423) and Martianus Capella (circa A.D. 400) and maintained by Emperor Julian the Apostate (A.D 332-363) and Nicolaus Cusanus (Nicholas of Cusa\u2014A.D.1401-1464) who himself based his opinions on those of Iamblichus of Chalcis, all of whom wrote long before Copernicus abrogated the idea.",

Copernicus, of course, was not the only astronomer of later times who appropriated the works of the ancients. The Danish as- tronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) also announced as his own discovery the fact that Venus and Mercury revolved around the Sun despite the fact that Heracleides of Pontus had already made the discovery. It might now be objected that these an- cient discoveries were not universally ad- hered to. Thus, for instance, Plutarch (A.D.46-120), who was anything but an \u201c astronomer, immortalized his conviction that Earth does not move. In other words, borrowing a phrase from the indomitable Charles Fort, there was not agreement among the wise men. The study of ancient Greek astronomy also makes it obvious Plato\u2014 427-348 B.C.\u2014who, in his old age that while an investigator might, through \"ePented for having placed Earth at the centre of observation and calculation, come to a cor- * rect conclusion about a celestial object, the (Mlustration by Charles Hogarth). very same person would often hold an in- correct belief concerning another. But was this any different than what transpired later in the so-called age of enlightenment. As Velikovsky so aptly noted: \u201cDuring his lifetime Copernicus had only one follower, Rheticus, and was rejected by all others. Kepler\u2019s discoveries were rejected by Galileo, his peer; Newton\u2019s gravita- tional theory was rejected by Leibnitz, his peer; and Agassiz, who was ridiculed, him- self rejected Darwin. Virchow did not support Pasteur; Edison rejected and fought against Tesla and the use of alternating current. The list can be multiplied a hundred times. It goes back to Archimedes\u2019 rejection of Aristarchus, who taught that the earth revolves around the sun.\u201d In fact, was it any different than what continues to transpire down to the present day? When new astronomical, or other scientific, discoveries come to light, as they continue to do almost day by day, and theories are then formulated to account for the discoveries, can it be said that astronomers, and/or other scientists, are almost immediately of one mind concerning them?

        "main_text": "Egypt, there was a well which, at noon on the day of summer solstice, was illuminated by the Sun down to the bottom. He also knew that, on the same day at Alexandria, a vertical staff cast a short shadow. From this\u2014a shadow in one place but no shadow in another on the same day \u2014Eratosthenes first verified that Earth was indeed spherical. Then, knowing the distance between Syene and Alexandria, which was measured at 5,000 stadia, and using some simple geometry, he realized that this was 7\u00b0, or close to 1/50 of a great circle. He thus arrived at the figure of 250,000 stadia, which he subsequently corrected to 252,000 stadia, as the circum- ference of Earth. When translated into miles or kilometers, his result was only a few percent off the mark. It was on thus discovering the vastness of the world he lived on that Eratosthenes became convinced of the immensity of the universe. INCLINATION TO THE SOUTH The Greeks were also aware that Earth\u2019s axis was inclined, and that it was inclined \u201cto- ward the south.\u201d As Plutarch wrote: \u201cDiogenes and Anaxagoras affirm that, after the world was composed and the earth had produced living creatures, the world out of its own propensity made an inclina- tion towards the south.\u201d Unfortunately, Plutarch, bless his soul, was not only not an astronomer, he was not much of a geographer either. So he did make something of a mess when it came to explaining the reasons behind Earth\u2019s inclination and, especially, when he attempted to account for its ef- fects. On the other hand, come to think of it, perhaps Plutarch should not be blamed too much for these misunderstandings since, in some instances, he actually claimed that he was but re- peating what others had asserted. '\u201d THE PRECESSION OF THE EQUINOXES Besides being inclined, Earth\u2019s axis spins in a strange fashion which has often been com- pared to that of a spinning top. Rather than rotating in a rigid manner, Earth\u2019s axis also wob- bles in such a way that its imaginary tip describes a circle of its own. In effect, the axis pre- cesses around the vertical so that it traces out a cone in space. This additional axial rotation thus causes an apparent shift of the stars, as viewed from Earth, which is different from the apparent daily revolution of the stars around the pole. Whereas the daily rotation causes the stars to seem to revolve around the Pole Star, precession causes the Pole Star itself to revolve in a circle of 231/2\u00b0 radius. Thus, throughout the years, the Pole Star is seen to shift and leave the north celestial pole. If another star is then in the right position, it becomes the new Pole Star. At present, the Pole Star is alpha Ursae Minoris, but, at the time of the Greek astrono- mers we are presently concerned with, it would have been beta Ursae Minoris. In 3000 B.C., it would have been alpha Draconis. It was not just the pole stars, however, that slowly \u201cpassed away,\u201d but the entire sky and, with it, its entire denizens. This movement, however, is very slow in execution, requiring 26,000 years in order to complete one full circle. The motion does not, therefore, lend itself to easy detection. Nor, for that matter, does the resul- tant change\u2014except over thousands of years. Needless to say, no one person can live long enough to detect the change. And yet, not only was this change detected, so was the preces- sional motion that gives rise to it. The discovery is attributed to one of the greatest astrono-",

It is said that Hipparchus came to his con- clusion by comparing the positions of the stars, especially Spica in the constellation Virgo, with the earlier ones given by Timo- charis of Alexandria sometime in the begin- ning of the 3rd century B.C. Hipparchus real- ized that the longitudes of the stars had in- creased and so concluded that the equinoctial points\u2014those points at which the Sun\u2019s path crosses the equator\u2014had moved westward along the ecliptic (moving clockwise for an observer on Earth). He estimated the move- ment at about a degree per century, or 36\" per year. The true value, of course, is closer to 50\" but, considering the crude equipment he had to work with, to say nothing of the diffi- culty of the task, one can claim that he did extremely well. It has, however, been argued that Hippar- chus could not have discovered this fact on the basis of Timocharis\u2019 observations alone, since these observations did not go back far enough in time for anyone to have noticed the difference in the positions of the stars as brought about by the slow motion of preces- sion. It is more probable that Hipparchus had access to much older Babylonian observa. tions. It was the Babylonians who had firs! started to measure longitudes by referring stars to the ecliptic. As George Sarton opined \u201c[Hipparchus\u2019] comparison of the longitudes of Spica (and other stars of low latitudes) with the longitudes determined 150 years before [by \u20181imocharis] in Alexandra may have roused his suspicion, but older observations were needed to carry conviction.\u201d'\u2019* Sarton, in fact, goes on to state that: \u201cTt has been claimed that the precession itself was discovered by the Babylonian as- tronomer Ki-din-nu (Cidenas of the Greeks...) who flourished c. 343 B.C. That is possible. Hipparchus may or may not have known of Cidenas\u2019 work, but it is certain that he was acquainted with Babylonian longitudes of stars.\u201d That Ki-din-nu (or Cidenas) was the true discoverer of this precessional motion has never been verified.

The prize for the cognition of what lies behind precession, however, remains his. This is not to say that others have not vied for the fame\u2014even if in retrospect and through modern proxy. None of these attempts have, however, withstood the test of scrutiny. THE CRIME OF ANAXAGORAS Anaxagoras (500-428 B.C.) was the first to clearly state that the Moon shines with the re- flected light from the Sun, from which he devised a theory concerning the phases of the Moon. At the time, as with Galileo much later, this doctrine, which was not in keeping with the prejudices of the day, was so dangerous that the manuscript in which Anaxagoras set out these theories had to be circulated in secrecy. A century later, Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), a great mind in some matters, not so in others, was to argue that the Moon exhibited phases and that eclipses occurred simply because that was the nature of Earth\u2019s satellite\u2014which, as Sagan succinctly put it, was \u201can explanation that explains nothing.\u201d'\u201d Anaxagoras also believed that the Sun and the stars were hot. While this was evident for the Sun, it was not, as it still is not, for the stars. When asked why we do not feel the heat of the stars, he replied correctly that it was because they were too far away. When he calculated the Sun to be larger than the Peloponnesus, which constitutes about a third of Greece, his es- timate was thought to be \u201cexcessive and absurd.\u201d!\u201d He knew that the Moon harbored mountains (although he also believed it harbored life). In the end, again much like Galileo, Anaxagoras was charged, convicted, and imprisoned for impiety, mainly because he had taught that the Moon consisted of ordinary, and not di- vine, matter. It took Pericles, the great Athenian leader, to engineer Anaxagoras\u2019 release from prison. SHADOWS THROUGH SPACE Thales, who lived toward the end of the 7th century B.C., has been lauded by his own an- cient countrymen as having been the first astronomer. Diogenes Laertius stated that Thales was first to receive the name of sage; that he was first to study astronomy and predict eclipses of the Sun and fix the solstices; was first to make a number of specific observations relating to the Sun and the Moon; was said to have \u201cdiscovered\u201d the seasons and to have di- vided the year into 365 days.'\u201d According to others, he was also the first, rather than the above mentioned Anaxagoras, to realize that the Moon was actually illuminated by the Sun. Thales is also said to have recognized and to have predicted the solstices; to have been the first to discover the passage of the Sun from one solstice to another; and to realize that this cycle was not always of equal length, but that, on the contrary, there were \u201cslight varia- tions in length of the solar seasons as divided by solstices and equinoxes.\u201d\"\"",

        "main_text": "But, despite William Mullen\u2019s noble attempt to uphold this lofty position for him,\u2122 the best that can be claimed for Thales is the honor of having been the first Greek astronomer. That being the case, one should attempt to find out exactly how much Thales could have bor- rowed from the earlier Babylonians. There has been much debate on how much Thales owes his fame to those who later praised his name. D. R. Dicks, for one, has insisted that Thales' reputation in having been the first Greek astronomer comes from later, unreliable, sources, and that, therefore, no validity should be applied to these claims.'* And while Mullen has found reason to question the evi- dence that Dicks relied on, the evidence he himself presented is, at best, circumstantial. '* Those who have sought to devalue Thales\u2019 reputation have also questioned his ability to predict eclipses. Both Plutarch\u2019 and Pliny (A.D. 23-79)\" knew that lunar eclipses were caused by the projection of Earth\u2019s shadow on the lunar surface. The passage of the Moon across the face of the Sun during a solar eclipse would have been more evident, so that it would also have been known that the Moon cast its shadow on earth during such an occur- rence.\u201d Even so, knowing what causes a lunar, or solar, eclipse is one thing; being able to predict either of them is quite another. Meanwhile, quite a number of ancient sources, including Herodotus, have claimed that Thales predicted an eclipse which took place during the battle between the Medes under Cyaxares and the Lydians under Alyattes.'\"* This has led historians to set the date of that battle at 585 B.C. Benny Peiser, on the other hand, has claimed that \u201cThales could not have possessed the knowledge necessary to predict eclipses in general.\u201d\u2019\u201d In this, he might not have been entirely correct. As van der Waerden had earlier noted: \u201cSuch a feat requires the experience of more than forty years, no matter how one pro- ceeds. It is not possible to accomplish it alone. But Thales had no Greek predecessors. The conclusion is inescapable that he must have drawn upon the experience of Ori- ental astronomers.\u201d Besides, when it comes to the eclipse that is said to have occurred at the time of the battle between the Medes and the Lydians, a close look at what Herodotus reported tells us that, while Thales did predict the year of this eclipse, he said nothing concerning the actual date, the time of day, or the place from which it would have been visible. As various scholars have noted, knowledge and a correct understanding of eclipse cycles should have enabled Thales to predict the eclipse in question by the day, and not just the year.'\" In his attempt to retain, or regain, Thales\u2019 reputation, Mullen has noted that none of the scholarly arguments denying Thales the capacity to predict eclipses and other celestial occur- rences \u201cis sufficient to prove that Thales did not begin an inquiry into each of these phenom-",

Thus | mention all this specifically to stem the possible accusation that I have taken every statement of the ancients as being necessarily true. THE METONIC CYCLE The reconciliation of the motions of the Sun with those of the Moon was required by an- cient societies in an endeavor to pin-point their seasonal festivals. Most Greek festivals were held at full moon with certain ceremonies to be held in certain months. The months, there- fore, needed to be reconciled with the year. But since twelve lunations fall somewhat short of the solar year, an extra month had to be added to the year every so often. According to Geminos of Rhodes, who wrote sometime in the first century B.C., such a system of intercalation was already in use \u201csome time before the second half of the fifth century B.C.\u201d'\u00ae The earliest such intercalation by the Greeks that has come down to us in- volved the supplementing of 96 lunar months through an 8-year period, a cycle they called octaeteris, with the addition of leap years every third, fifth, and eighth years by inserting an extra month into each of them.\u201c By the fifth century B.C., however, it had been realized that this 8-year cycle was not all that accurate. The small difference between 99 months (the 96 plus the 3 of the leap years) and the 8 years into which they tried to fit them accumulated as the years went by so that the integration of the solar and lunar motions was thrown off balance. It was the Athenian astronomer Meton who then realized that the Moon returned to the same position in relation to the Sun every 19 years\u2014or so Geminos had it stated, for which reason the system has, to this day, been called the Metonic cycle. This cycle works better than the 8-year one because 19 years equal 235 lunations almost exactly.\u2019 In actual fact, however, there are indications that the Babylonians had been using this 19- year cycle some one hundred years earlier. The Chinese also seem to have known about it, although it cannot be ascertained just how early the relationship was discovered and/or bor- rowed. Known as the chang, dates separated by multiples of 19 years are known from in- scriptions on Shang dynasty oracle bones. Diodorus Siculus also quoted a no-longer extant work by Hecateus of Abdera who also mentioned this 19-year return of the Moon and that it was known to the Hyperboreans who inhabited an island \u201cnot smaller than Sicily\u201d which was located \u201copposite to the coast of Celtic Gaul,\u201d which could only have been Britain.\u201d In Tibet, the year is counted as 360 days with the addition of seven intercalary months over a 19-year interval set up to keep the phases of the Moon in step with the solar year and the seasons.\u2019\u201d It is not known, however, how old this system is.

THE ROTATION AND REVOLUTION OF PLANETS That the planets both rotated on their own axes and moved on their orbits was well known to Plato. Thus he wrote that the Creator \u201cgave to each [of the heavenly bodies] two movements: the first, a movement on the same spot after the same manner...the second a forward movement....\u201d'\u201d Nor was Plato the only one. As Lynn Rose wrote: \u201cThe Sicilian Pythagorians Hiketas and Ekphantos, both of whom were from Syra- cuse, spoke explicitly of Earth\u2019s rotation in situ. The cosmology of Herakleides of Pontus...featured the same basic device.\u201d!\u201d PLANETARY CONJUNCTIONS Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), famous for his discovery of the three laws of planetary motions, wrote of a \u201cgreat conjunction\u201d that took place between the planets Jupiter and Sat- urn every 20 years, culminating in a \u201cmighty conjunction\u201d every 60 years (59.6, more cor- rectly).'* Kepler then prepared some diagrams, known as trigons, illuminating these con- junctions as they occurred against the background of the zodiac. As E. S. Kennedy has shown, however, Arabian astrology already knew all that.'* Earlier still, the Neoplatonist Olympiodorus (6th century A.D.) knew, and wrote, that one revolution of Jupiter took twelve years (modern calculation: 11.86) and that of Saturn was accomplished in thirty years (modern calculation: 29.46 years). \u201cFor if the sphere of Jupiter comes from the same to the same in twelve years, but that of Saturn in thirty years, it is evident that when Jupiter has made five, Saturn will have made two revolutions: for twice thirty is sixty, and so likewise is twelve times five; so that their revolutions will be conjoined in sixty years.\u201d\"* THE PERIODICITY OF COMETS It has often been stated that ancient historical documents, to say nothing of mythological ones, have nothing to offer as far as modern astronomy is concerned. But, as Livio Stecchini pointed out, this is certainly not true when it comes to the periodicity of comets. As he wrote: \u201cNo science of comets is possible without the use of these records.

And that intervals between worlds are unequal; and that in one quarter of space (worlds) are more numerous, and in another less so; and that some of them increase in bulk, but that others attain their full size, while others dwindle away; and that in one quarter they are coming into existence, whilst in an- other they are failing; and that they are destroyed by clashing one with another.

He had no Pericles to save him from those in authority. In A.D. 1600, Bruno was burned alive at the stake by the Catholic Inquisi- tion for espousing the belief, among other things, that other worlds must necessarily harbor other life. The belief that life exists on other planets did not, however, originate with him. As far back as the fourth century B.C., Metrodorus of Chios had already written that: \u201cTo con- sider the Earth the only populated world in infinite space is as absurd as to assert that in an entire field sown with seed, only one grain will grow.\u201d'\u201d THE BABYLONIAN PRECEDENCE We have come a long way in analyzing the astronomical knowledge of ancient peo- ples\u2014from eye-witness reports of meteors and the metallic structure of meteorites to the cor- rect motions of the heavenly bodies; from the calculation of complex calendrical systems to the prediction of solar and lunar eclipses; from the intricacies of Mesoamerican computations to the Greek passion for exactitude and philosophical daring. I therefore hope that when, in the following chapters, the main thesis of this work is revealed, no one will counter its reve- lations by objecting that the ancients had very little astronomical knowledge at their disposal to be taken seriously. It is, moreover, accepted that this ancient knowledge was not necessarily the property of the masses. Nor was it all necessarily adhered to by every scholar of the time. The man in the street, always prone to age-old superstitions, had little mind of astronomical matters. But, to an extent, this was not much different than it is at present. Meanwhile, competing theoreticians were very often contradicted by others. Plutarch, for instance, delighted in enumerating the various and contradictory theories concerning the na- ture of comets, some of which theories were hilarious even by the standards of his day. And, as we have seen, while the Greeks were quite aware of Earth\u2019s axial tilt, they fell far short when it came to explaining the reason behind it. Can it, however, be said that all modern astronomers agree on each and every astronomi- cal issue, or that some of their theories have not been, or will not be, found to be in error? Why should we expect more stringent standards from our ancient forebears? Have we not already seen that many of the great astronomical break-throughs and theories\u2014even that concerning the Big Bang \u2014were originally discovered, or thought of, by these very ancients? It is no secret\u2014and it never has been\u2014that the Greeks learned, and borrowed, much of their astronomical knowledge from the Babylonians. Nor, unlike many of their modern counterparts, did they ever try to hide the fact. As Alexander Jones noted: \u201cThe Greek as-",

When it comes to the constellations, we still owe their present names and adopted shapes to the Greeks, but, so it seems, the Greeks themselves had borrowed even these from the Babylonians. Thus, for instance, where the Greeks saw a scorpion in the constellation Scor- pio, so had the Babylonians before them. Where the Greeks saw twins in the constellation Gemini, so had the Babylonians before them. Peter James has even indicated \u201csome specific linguistic borrowing\u201d in this context. Take, for instance, the constellation which the Greeks called Pegasus. To the Sumerians and Akkadians this group of stars was known as Iku, a word that meant \u201cfield.\u201d Why, then, did the Greeks see a horse in this constellation had they really borrowed their lore from them? This misnomer, according to James, probably stems from the fact that, in Greek, igo, which sounds much like iku , used to mean \u201chorse\u201d \u2014as recorded on the Linear B Tablets\u2014before the word hippos was later adopted. If this is true, it would also mean that the borrowing of Babylonian astronomical knowledge by the Greeks \u201chad already begun in Mycenaean times,\u201d\u201d\u201d to which the Linear B Tablets belong. It is known that Democritus \u201cspent some time in the East and his astronomic ideas were definitely Babylonian.\u201d '\u2122 So, also, with Hipparchus, who based much of his findings on Babylonian records. Here is what G. J. Toomer had to say about the subject: \u201cIt has always been known that Hipparchus derived material from Babylonian astron- omy. A considerable number of Babylonian observations are quoted in Ptolemy\u2019s Al- magest (which is the principal source of our knowledge of Hipparchus\u2019 work), and some of these are explicitly said to have been used by Hipparchus. But it is only in the present [20th] century, with the decipherment and interpretation of the relevant cu- neiform texts, that his debt to Mesopotamian sources was more fully revealed.\u201d \u201cThus, although our information about Hipparchus\u2019 work is largely secondhand and fragmentary, his extensive knowledge of both the observational and theoretical parts of Babylonian astronomy is beyond any doubt.\u201d\"\u201d As James pointed out:",

Long before even the Babylonians, the constellations Taurus, Leo, and Scorpius had already been assimilated to a bull, a lion, and a scorpion. The German historian of science, Willy Hartner, has even attempted to trace the symbols associated with these constellations farther back in time, to the Neolithic people of Elam and Persia. As early as the fourth millennium B.C., these people of southern Iraq were already drawing bulls, lions, and scorpions studded with star symbols.\" To quote Edwin Krupp: \u201cSix thousand years ago, the stars of Taurus, Leo, and Scorpius rose heliacally at sig- nificant times of the year, as seen from latitude 30 degrees north. This is close to the latitude of Ur, the Sumerian city founded on the Euphrates River five thousand years ago.\u201d THE ASTRONOMICAL DIARIES That the Babylonians carefully noted and recorded eclipses is reported by Claudius Ptolemy, who had access to a continuous series of such observations reaching back to 747 B.C. Ptolemy implies that the series did not reach further back in time than that,\u2019\u00ae which has led various authorities to claim that the observation of eclipses by the Babylonians com- menced with Nabonassar who, according to generally accepted chronology, reigned over Babylon somewhere between 747 and 732 B.C. Franz Xavier Kugler, who examined more than one hundred Babylonian cuneiform tab- lets pertaining to astronomy, has demonstrated that the oldest documents containing a scien- tific approach to astronomy dated only from the second half of the sixth century B.C.\" Nabonassar, however, is known to have destroyed previously existing observations in order that exact historical chronology would commence with his own reign.\u2019 The Babylonians also compiled a catalogue of the fixed stars and recorded the occulta- tions of the planets by the Sun and Moon.\u201d Through the use of gnomons, and other sun-di- als, they were able to measure time during the day and were able to fix the length of the solar day with sufficient accuracy. They determined the synodic revolution of the Moon within a small fraction of the correct value.\"\u00ae They discovered that the length of the solar year was close to 3651/4 days.\u201d They knew that comets were permanent bodies revolving in orbits similar to, but greater than, those which the planets followed.'\u00ae When Richard Stephenson analyzed the content of Babylonian astronomy, he did not find it wanting.

All that they recorded, he has con- cluded, \u201chas actually happened in the sky.\u201d As far as he was concerned, the old Babylonian eclipse data can be used with confidence. As he wrote: \u201cComparison of modern calculations with the Babylonian eclipse records gives an excellent figure for the average rate of length- ening of the day over the past 2500 years.\u201d In fact, he went out of his way to inform his read- ers how Babylonian astronomical records were proving useful to modern astronomers in cal- culating changes in the length of the day. He did, of course, discover a statistical uncertainty of 1.78 milliseconds per century, but, as he explained, this \u201carises not so much from inaccu- racies in the Babylonian measurements but more from uncertainties in the modern estimates of the rate of expansion of the Moon\u2019s orbit.\u201d\"\" The Assyro-Babylonians, or Chaldeans as Diodorus Siculus called them, already knew that the planetary system was a dynamic one. As Diodorus wrote: \u201cEach of the planets, ac- cording to them has its own particular course, and its velocities and periods of time are sub- ject to change and variation.\u201d'\u201d They also knew that Earth was a sphere and thus counted it among the planets. This is evidenced by the words of Diodorus who wrote that the Chaldeans had it stated \u201cthat the moon\u2019s light is reflected and her eclipses are due to the shadow of the earth.\u201d Among the Babylonians, texts that deal strictly with astronomical, as opposed to astro- logical, observations do not seem to have made their appearance until about the middle of the seventh century B.C. during the reign of Nabonassar. It is from about this time, down to the turn of the millennium, that we have in our possession a collection of cuneiform tablets to which Abraham Sachs has applied the term \u201castronomical diaries.\u201d These diaries record such phenomena as the length of the lunar months, based on the phases of the Moon; lunar and solar eclipses; the dates of first visibility for Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn; the first and last visibilities of the inner planets, Venus and Mercury; the dates of the occurrences of the equinoxes and solstices; the dates of the significant appearances of the star Sirius; and the \u201cconjunction\u201d of the Moon and each of the visible planets with various stars. Meteorological phenomena during the rainy seasons are also recorded, with diverse cloud and storm conditions. To all of this, one finds appended the changes in the level (rise or fall) of the river at Babylon, often followed \u201cby a report of secular events or rumors of such events.\u201d Finally, the amount of produce (barley, dates, etc.) that could be purchased for one shekel of silver during any one month is also listed. The technical data\u2014 measurements, cal- culations\u2014 given in cubits and degrees, are evidence of a sophisticated attempt at reconciling once mysterious motions with numerical allocation, while the glosses concerning obstruction of visibility by bad weather are indicative of diligent observation.\u201d There is nothing spurious about these astronomical diaries\u2014nothing magical, mythologi- cal, or even faintly oracular. They are a mere record of the night by night occurrences con- cerning the heavenly bodies\u2014hence the term \u201cdiaries\u2019\u2014month by month, throughout the year. Were it not for the historical events that they also report, they would probably have in- spired less interest among scholars. Astronomically, they are nothing but a catalogue of the same boring celestial events that we see enacted in the sky above us to this day. But they are accurate \u2014so that a modern student of astronomy would not have been embarrassed had he or she been the author of the diaries.

Abstract numerical tables, or ephemerides, representing the motions of the heavenly bodies, were much in vogue at the time. These continued to record the recurrence of astronomical phe- nomena, year by year, \u201cwith an accuracy comparable with that of contemporary observa- tions.\u201d\"\u201d' Judging by the contents of the astronomical diaries, this accuracy can be stretched to 747 B.C. There is no great wonder in all of this, but it does prove one point, banal as it may seem, and that is this: Beginning from aft least the middle of the seventh century B.C., Babylonian astronomers knew very well what these pin-points of light called planets looked like and could easily distinguish one from the other; they knew where every planet belonged in the sky and what track each one of them invariably followed\u2014an easy matter for anyone with a keen eye-sight plus the patience and the motivation to learn. Yes, I know, it is hardly even worth mentioning. Why, then, contrary to what we see above us in the night sky at present, did these same Babylonian astronomers insist that the planet we call Saturn had been the most prominent body in the sky? That is a question the answer to which, beginning in the very next chapter of this work, will carry us into some very strange and deep waters.",

Saturn]...is the most conspicuous...\u201d As viewed from Earth, this is simply not so. Venus is much more prominent. It is easily the brightest of the planets, bright enough at night to cast shadows and, when meteorological conditions permit, bright enough to be seen during the day. In contradistinction, Saturn is a very difficult object to observe. Even Bob Forrest, one of the strongest opponents of cosmic catastrophism, was moved to display his bewilderment at this datum: \u201cThe only puzzling thing about this passage [of Diodorus] is the way Saturn is said to be the most conspicuous of the planets. All else is fairly routine.\u201d? As we shall see, this statement is not the \u201conly puzzling thing\u201d in this passage of Diodorus; nor is all else in it \u201cfairly routine.\u201d But one thing at a time. The term \u201cChaldean,\u201d meanwhile, has long been misunderstood and misapplied by an- cient historians and moderns alike. As used by Diodorus and other classical authors, the term simply meant \u201castrologers\u201d and/or \u201castronomers,\u201d but always in relation to the Babylonians.* These, then, were the same Babylonians whose astronomical achievements we have enumer- ated in the previous section. But how, then, with all of their sophisticated knowledge of the heavens, could they have committed such an error. Or, ifan error it was not, why would they have perpetuated such a falsity? Of course, one could also ask: Why take the word of Diodorus, a Greek historian, who could easily have been mistaken on matters Babylonian? But was Diodorus the only writer of antiquity who ever reported this strange belief concerning the planet Saturn? And, in fact, were the Babylonians the only ones who were supposed to have asserted this oddity? To give but one other example\u2014and later we shall give others\u2014we note here one of the Sanskrit names of the planet Saturn, that is Grahanayakah.* The name is composed of the",

But if the astronomers of the time could see, as they must have, that Saturn was not the most prominent, or conspicuous, of the planets, on what was the belief based? STELLA SOLIS So what was it that made the Babylonians allude to Saturn as the most prominent of the planets\u2014prominent enough for them to refer to it, inter alia, as En-Me Sar-ra, that is \u201cLord of the Law of the Universe\u201d?\u2019 One must admit, that is quite a lofty title to bestow on what appears to be a mere pin-point of light in the present night sky. The clue to Saturn\u2019s prominence\u2014even loftiness\u2014was supplied by Diodorus in the very same passage we have already partly quoted. There, this writer continues to report that \u201cthe [planet] named Cronus [i.e. Saturn] by the Greeks...they [the Chaldeans] call the star of Hel- ios...\u201d It is somewhat odd that Forrest did not find this statement as \u201cpuzzling\u201d as the one which proclaims Saturn to be the most prominent of the planets. Odder still is that he relegated it to the unimportance of \u201cfairly routine\u201d reporting because, to the Greeks of Diodorus\u2019 time, Hel- ios was the Sun. From it are derived such Sun-oriented English words as \u201cheliacal,\u201d \u201cheliocentric,\u201d and \u201cheliograph.\u201d Why would the Babylonians have referred to the planet Saturn as the star of the Sun? But what of the Babylonians themselves? Do we not hear from them directly? With so many cuneiform tablets having been lost through the vagaries of nature and the hand of man, and with so many undeciphered others falling apart in museum basements, it would not have been remarkable had this datum not survived in the original. But it has, and in more than one text. R. C. Thompson might have been the first to discover, even if not entirely understand, this Babylonian verity. Thus, another Babylonian name for the planet Saturn was (Mul) Lu- Bat Sag-U8,\u2019 and we find it stated in an astrological report from that nation that \u201c(Mul) Lu- Bat Sag-US Mul (il) Samas \u00a7u-u,\u201d which Thompson translated as \u201c[the planet] Saturn is the star of the sun.\u201d\u201d\u00b0 Actually, Diodorus should have known that this belief was already common among the scholars of his own nation. Eratosthenes of Alexandria, who thrived somewhere between 276 and 194 B.C., and whose astronomical, mathematical, and geographical knowledge enabled him, as we have already seen, to measure Earth\u2019s circumference, identified the planet Saturn as the star of the Sun, as so did several other Greek writers.''

In his enumeration of the planets, the Latin writer Gaius Tulius Hyginus who, as the superintendent of the Palatine Library, must have had access to much older material, referred to the planet in question as the star of Sol.\" As just about any dictionary will verify, Sol was not only the Roman Sun personified, it was, as it still is, the very Latin word for \u201cSun.\u201d From it are derived such English words as \u201csolar,\u201d \u201csolarium,\u201d and \u201csolstice.\u201d The scholiast on Germanicus also lists Saturn as Stella Solis'\u00b0\u2014Star of the Sun\u2014a name which apparently was a common designation for the planet in Roman times.'\u00b0 But whence the belief? Better still, what does the designation \u201cstar of the Sun\u201d really mean? To what does it allude? A telling clue comes from Sanskrit. In this language, Surya is the common name for the Sun. Suryaputrah, which means \u201cson of the Sun,\u201d is however one of the names for the planet Saturn.\u201d Another Sanskrit name for the Sun is Ravi and, again, we find the planet Saturn designated as Raviputra which also means \u201cson of the Sun.\u201d\u201d As the son of the Sun, Saturn could be termed the star of the Sun. But this only raises another question. Why would Saturn, among the planets, have been thought of as the son of the Sun? Let us go one step farther. Yet another Sanskrit name for the planet Saturn is Saurah. But saurah also means \u201csolar day\u201d and/or \u201csolar month.\u201d This seems to indicate that the con- nection between Saturn and the Sun was more intimate than we have so far deduced. In fact, this last datum is enough to make one believe that, at least to the Hindus, Saturn and the Sun were close to being synonymous. (MUL) LU-BAT SAG-U5 A common entry in a collection of astrological reports from Nineveh and Babylon which, in variant forms, is many times repeated, uses the formula \u201cWhen Shamash [the same as Sama] stands in the halo of Sin\u201d such and such a thing will come to pass.\u201d Now open up just about any work on Assyro-Babylonian mythology and you will find it stated that Shamash and Sin were the deified Sun and Moon. According to this belief, the omen men- tioned above would then translate as \u201cwhen the Sun stands in the halo of the Moon\u201d such and such a thing will come to pass. Now while Sun and Moon can be seen together, the Sun can never appear in the halo of the Moon. For one thing, the Sun does not appear small enough to fit between the Moon and its surrounding halo\u2014when it has one; for another, the Moon can only appear within a halo during the night when the Sun, needless to say, is absent. What, then, could the Babylonian astrologers have been alluding to?",

        "main_text": "There is no point in claiming that this was astrological nonsense. Babylonian astrologers, like those of ancient China, were required to acquaint their rulers with the mandates of heaven, to warn them of impending disasters or to soothe their fears with reports of divine satisfaction. The foretold events might not always have come to pass. Fallacious predictions, however, were one thing; impossible ones were quite another. There would have been no point in predicting an event based on an astronomical occurrence that could never have come to pass. A prognostication based on the appearance of the Sun within the halo of the Moon would not only have been useless, it would have been considered utterly insane. No Babylon- ian astrologer would have risked ridicule, not to mention royal displeasure, by sending such a prediction to his king. Why, then, did they even bother writing down such a formula? As Morris Jastrow, even without knowing the full implication of these formulae, con- cluded: \u201cSince this phenomenon can only occur at night, Sama cannot of course be the sun.\u201d This brings us back to the Babylonian statement mentioned earlier which reads \u201c(Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-U8 (il) SamaS Su-u,\u201d and which, as we have seen, Thompson translated as \u201cSaturn is the star of the sun.\u201d Jastrow, however, has noted that while this reading is possible, a more accurate translation would be \u201cSaturn is the sun-star.\u201d\u201d We note here the difference between calling Saturn the star of the Sun\u2014the star belonging to the Sun\u2014and naming it as the Sun-star since the latter seems to connote the Sun itself. In fact, another translation given by Jastrow is \u201c[the] planet Saturn (as a) star is Shamash.\u201d Stated more clearly, what this datum is really telling us is that \u201cthe planet Saturn is Shamash\u201d\u2122 or \u201cShamash is the planet Saturn.\u201d What is also of interest is that this statement appears as a gloss in one of those omens which uses the formula \u201cwhen Shamash stands in the halo of Sin.\u201d* This, then, was the as- trologers\u2019 way of informing whoever read this particular report that by Shamash the planet Saturn, and not the Sun, was meant. The formula in question should therefore read \u201cwhen Saturn stands in the halo of Sin\u201d such and such a thing will come to pass. This is further clarified by another gloss which appears in a number of similar cases which unambiguously declares that (Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-U8 ina tarbas Sin izzaz\u201d \u2014i.e. \u201cSaturn stands in the halo of Sin.\u201d* This not only makes better observational sense, it compliments\u2014nay, validates\u2014the formula which uses Shamash as a name for Saturn. If conditions permit, the pin-point of light in the night sky that is Saturn can be discerned within the halo of the Moon. (Actually, this argument, which I myself have had reason to repeat in the past,\u201d is not even called for because, as I will indicate in a future work, Sin did not always stand for the Moon.\u201d) Thompson, of course, was aware before Jastrow that the Babylonians called Saturn by the name of Shamash.\u201d Since this verity came to light at least as early as 1900, it is a sin of omission\u2014worse still, a scholarly deception\u2014not to have it so stated in current works deal- ing with Assyro-Babylonian mythology.

In this case the gloss was made to indicate \u201cSame u-mi\u201d\u2014i.e. \u201cSama of the day.\u201d\u00ae In fact, variants of the name Shamash still mean \u201csun\u201d in many modern Semitic lan- guages.\u201d Thus, in Hebrew, the common word for \u201csun\u201d is shemesh. Among the Aramaeans the word was also rendered SemeS (shemesh) or SimSa (shimsha).* In pre-Islamic times, the Arabic word was SamSu (Shamshu).* Even in Maltese, the only European language with a distinctive Semitic root-base, the Sun is called xemx,\u201d where the \u201cx\u201d is phonetically equiva- lent to \u201csh\u201d \u2014thus shemsh. All of this raises some very interesting questions. Why, for instance, was the planet Sat- urn called by the same name as the Sun? It is not as if the Babylonians had no other names for Saturn\u2014we have already encountered two: En-Me Sar-ra and (Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-US. But also, ancient names, unlike some modern ones, carried their own meanings. No one in those days would have thought of naming a person or an object by using lexical abstraction. Shemesh, and therefore Shamash, means \u201cto be brilliant,\u201d\"* and while this may be an apt name for the Sun, one would hardly think of alluding to the pin-point of light that is Saturn by the same appellation. And yet this is precisely what the Babylonians did. As Jastrow was forced to conclude, \u201cthe fact that Saturn was also called the \u2018sun\u2019 is vouched for, both by ex- planatory notes attached to astrological connotations, and by notices in classical writings to that effect.\u201d\u201d Thus, while we understand that Shamash was the name of the planet Saturn as well as the Sun, is it also to be understood that Saturn was once believed to have been as brilliant as the Sun? THE LIGHT OF THE GODS The close relationship, or quasi-synonymy, between the planet Saturn and the Sun was not, in Mesopotamia, restricted to the Babylonian Shamash. The Sumerian planetary god Ninurta also shared this dual characteristic. Thus Stephen Langdon could speak of \u201cthe sun- god Ninurta\u201d in one breath while claiming in the next that, in Sumero-Babylonian religion, Ninurta was \u201cthe war god and planet Saturn.\u201d\u201d It was even said of Ninurta that his face was Shamash.\" Together with many other deities, Ninurta has often been presented by mythologists as a storm god. This view owes its origin to the texts themselves in which Ninurta is lauded as u sur me-a* or, in Sumerian, as Lugal-e ud me-l\u00e9m-bi nir-gal.\u00ae In the past, these epithets had been translated as \u201cthe most furious storm (or stormwind)\u201d and \u201cKing, Storm whose bril-",

The epithets quoted above should therefore read \u201cthe most furious[?] light\u201d and \u201cKing, Light whose brilliance surpassed (all others\u2014i.e. all other gods).\u201d Thus, originally, Ninurta seems to have had nothing to do with storms and everything to do with light\u2014which is much in keeping with his sun-like qualities. Nimrod has also, and often, been identified as the planet Saturn,\u201d even if the reason for the identification has seldom been clarified. When a reason is given, it usually runs some- thing like the following: Nimrod, sometimes called Nebrod, the traditional founder of Baby- lon, was \u201cthe first to become king on earth...and took as title the name of the planet Kronos [which was Saturn].\u201d* Nimrod, however, did not have to take the name of the planet Saturn because his name was already that of Saturn. Thus, for instance, Nimrod has also, and often, been claimed to be an alias of Ninurta.\u201d The actual truth, however, is that the two names are really one and the same. The cuneiform characters which spell nin, ur, and ta can also be read nim, ru, and ud respectively\u201d \u2014which can be said to be the same syllables in reverse and which, of course, spell \u201cnimru-ud,\u201d a name that has been popularized as \u201cNimrod.\u201d* Of course, it is not only in legendary tales, such as those dealing with Nimrod, that Saturn was lauded as king\u2014often the very first king the world had ever known. As we have already seen above, in the original, that is older, sources, Ninurta/Saturn is himself proclaimed lugal\u2014that is \u201cking.\u201d And this, again, is in keeping with the mytho-historical record since all of the Saturnian deities were revered as kings, the first of their line. Formerly, when the decipherment of cuneiform was still in its infancy and the translitera- tion of the Mesopotamian deities had not yet been formalized, the name Ninurta was vari- ously read as Ninib, Ninip, or simply Nin, a title which has been translated as meaning \u201cLord,\u201d although it also stands for \u201cLady.\u201d\u201d (And is it because of this that Fred Bratton listed Ninurta as a fertility goddess,\u201d or was this merely a typographical error?) Thus, scholars of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were wont to refer to this astral deity by one, or more, of the above names. Writing in 1885, George Rawlinson opted for Nin",

As we noted in Chapter 1 of this work, the cuneiform sign for \u201cgod\u201d and \u201cplanet\u201d was one and the same\u2014%. However, the same cuneiform sign also stood for \u201cking.\u201d* But, more than that, the very same ideogram was also used to \u201cspell\u201d the name of the great Sumerian god An (or Anu)\u201d who\u2014as the father of all the gods, the \u201cHead of the older generation of gods,\u201d standing at the beginning of every theological list from all periods*\u2014can also be understood as a personification of the Saturnian deity. More in keeping with our subject, we also find Ninib lauded as \u201cthe light of heaven and earth\u201d and, quite explicitly, as \u201che who, like the sun, the light of the gods, irradiates the na- tions.\u201d There is, again, no point in claiming that these were metaphorical epithets meant to be applied to the god and not the planet he represented because, to the ancients who venerated him, the god and the planet was one and the same. And this, incidentally, is not merely my contention. Conventional mythologists had recognized this fact for themselves even though they found it very difficult to accept. Thus Peter Jensen was forced to see in Saturn an an- cient symbol of the \u201ceastern sun\u201d or \u201cthe sun on the horizon,\u201d\u00ae without however offering a single piece of evidence for this interpretation. George Rawlinson himself found these epi- thets \u201cvery difficult to reconcile with the notion that, as a celestial luminary, [Ninip] was Sat- urn.\u201d*' Somewhat like Jensen, he, also, sought to explain the situation by appealing to astral bodies other than the one indicated by the texts themselves. As he wrote: \u201cThese phrases ap- pear to point to the Moon, or to some very brilliant star, and are scarcely reconcilable with the notion that [Ninip] was the dark and distant Saturn.\u201d\u00ae Elsewhere, and earlier, Rawlinson had indicated the same bewilderment when he asked: \u201cHow is it possible that the dark and distant planet Saturn can answer to the luminary who [or which] \u2018irradiates the nations like the sun, the light of the gods\u2019?\u201d\u00ae NINGIRSU Other than earlier readings of the name Ninurta as Nin, Ninib, Ninip, etc., the deity in question possessed some bona fide aliases, one of which was Ningirsu*\u2014the Lord of Girsu (in Lagash).\u00a9 This is ascertained by the Gula Hymn of Bullutsa-rabi in which the consort of the goddess Gula (also known as Bau and/or Nin-Karrak)\u00ae is called by various names among",

Apart from the gloss already there discussed, which explains that Shamash is the name of the planet Saturn (Lu-Bat Sag-US), we also come across a clarifica- tion which names Ninib/Ninurta as \u201cstanding therein.\u201d\u201d This indicates, beyond any reason- able doubt, that Ninib/Ninurta was the same as Lu-Bat Sag-US/Shamash/Saturn.\u201d As Donald Mackenzie noted: \u201cThe sun god was identical with Ninip and Nin-Girsu...and resembling Babbar, \u2018the shining one,\u2019 the solar deity of Akkadian Sippar, whose Semitic name was Shamash.\u201d\u201d Also, in a slab relief of the god retrieved from the temple of Ninurta in ancient Kalakh (or Kalhu), present-day Nimrud (still named after the very god), Ninurta is depicted with the scythe as one of his weapons. As is widely known, the scythe was the favored weapon of Kronos/Saturnus. Thus, as Jastrow admitted, Franz Kugler was correct in identify- ing \u201cthe planet (Lu-Bat) whose name is Ninib [i.e. Ninurta]\u201d as referring to Saturn.\u201d And, let\u2019s face it, in a bilingual list of the planets, now in the British Museum, Ninurta is definitely listed as the name of the planet Saturn.\u201d Now it should be understood that the term \u201cLu-Bat\u201d was also used to designate Mars and Mercury besides Saturn. A. F. O\u2019D Alexander, however, misunderstood the usage of this term when he stated that a \u201cfurther ambiguity was caused by using lubad [the same as Lu- Bat] (\u2018planet\u2019) sometimes for Saturn, sometimes for Mercury.\u201d\u2122 What Alexander should",

THE TRUE SUN Like that of other ancient nations, Hindu astronomy is inseparable from mythology. This particular mythology, however, continues to thrive as the basis of Hindu religion. In a way, it can therefore be said that, among the Hindus, planetary worship is practiced to this day\u2014and not only in an indirect way. Here I would like to remind the reader of that passage from the Linga Purana we had earlier looked at which admonishes that \u201cthe worship of the planets should be pursued by good men.\u201d Moreover, the reason behind this admonition is the ward- ing-off of evil at times of planetary \u201charassment.\u201d That, in these modern times, not many practicing Hindus are even aware of these words, and that few, if any, among them actually practice planetary worship, is besides the point. What is at issue here is that the admonition in question is contained in one of the missals, if you wish, by which one of the world\u2019s great living religions is meant to abide. Like the gods of other nations, Vedic deities are known by more than one name or epithet as so, also, are the planets. Thus, one of the names for the Sun in Sanskrit is Arka.\u00ae But then we find that three related designations for the planet Saturn in the same language are Arki,\u201d Arka-putra,\u201d and Arkatanayah.\u00ae Both Arka-putra and Arkatanayah translate as \u201cson of the Sun.\u201d \u00a9 Arkaja, which means \u201csun-born\u201d can also be applied to the planet Saturn,\u201d as so, also, can Arkanandana.\u201d So, once again, we find the planet Saturn bearing a name which is shared by the Sun. Hindu mythology, of course, is largely based on Vedic belief. And yet, as one critic pointed out quite a few years ago, it has never been proved to the general satisfaction of In- dologists that any planets are mentioned in the Vedas.\u201d As I had earlier written in reference to this criticism, however, this lack can be compensated for \u201cif it can be shown that certain deities mentioned in the [Vedic] hymns possess planetary traits and/or characteristics com- parable to the [known] planetary deities of other nations.\u201d\u00ae Today I can go even further be- cause, if it can be shown that the names and/or epithets applied to the Vedic deities are iden- tical to those applied to the planets by the same race and in the same language, the equiva- lence of deities and planets is proven on home ground without any recourse or appeal to comparative studies. Such, for instance, is the case with Brahma, the supreme creator of In- dian mythology. Strictly speaking, Brahma was not a Vedic deity. He more properly belongs to that corpus of Hindu lore known as Brahmanic mythology. He was proclaimed the first of the Devas, usually said to mean \u201cgods,\u201d but which properly translates as \u201cshining ones. Here it should be noted that the Sanskrit adjective brahmanya means \u201crelating [or belonging] to Brahma. \u201d*",

In fact, while Indologists may find it difficult to accept, Brahma has long been identified as Saturn by certain sages of Hindu religion itself.\u00b0 What is of greater import to this study is that these sages consider Brahma to be the \u201ctrue sun\u201d\u201d\u2014which is the same as saying that, to them, it is Saturn, and not the present solar orb, that is the real \u201csun.\u201d Since even these sages can see that this is absurdly not so, we can only assume, on the strength of what we have learned, that this dictum must have been believed to stem from an- cient lore. But how could Saturn have been to ancient man what the Sun is to us today? As any work on Indian mythology Brahma, whom certain Hindu sages identify as the will assert, Surya is not only the name planet Saturn and a form of the True Sun. of the god of the Sun but is the most common Sanskrit name of the Sun it- self. There are, however, lines of evidence which indicate that Surya, too, was originally Sat- urn, the least of which not being the reference to Surya as graha Surya, that is the planet Sun.* But let me forestall an objection. It will be pointed out by the knowledgeable that in India, as in certain other nations, the Sun was counted, with the Moon, as one of the seven \u201cplanets.\u201d\u201d But one hardly finds, among these other nations, the Sun itself alluded to singly by a term reserved for planets. Even so, one might argue that the Hindus allowed this exception. Maybe so. But, as in the case of the Egyptian Ra, Surya is described as having motions and characteristics which do not fit those of the Sun. Thus, to give but one example (and, later, I shall be giving others), Surya is said to have occupied samanam dhama, which means \u201cthe same place of rising and setting.\u201d\"\u00ae Everyone knows that the Sun does not rise and set in the same place. (How this oddity, in turn, applies to the primeval Saturn will be explained in a later chapter of this work.) Let me, however, be a little more specific. Surya is also termed Suraj.

As earlier noted, another Sanskrit name for the planet Saturn is Graha- nayakah, which means \u201cchief, or leader, of the planets.\u201d But, again, Grahanayakah is also one of the names bestowed on the Sun.'\u201d THE SATURNIAN SUN We have now reached a point where we face the risk of monoto- nous repetition. But ours is a precari- ous position since, while listening to the voice of antiquity, we seem to be lending a deaf ear to astronomical principles. For the moment, however, our main interest must focus on what the ancients had to say concerning the cosmos around them. Thus, if our inquiry is to have any meaning, our position will have to be fortified and, / hopefully, sustained by invoking first (F the strength of numbers. Unless enough evidence is presented, we will always face the greater risk of being accused of selectivity. For that reason, and in order to show that the theme being developed here \u201cee well Surya\u2014the sun-god whose motions fail to conform to nigh universal, we must continue to those of the present Sun. press home with further examples until we have covered a fair share of the ancient world. When it comes to astronomical lore, ancient Egypt presents something of a problem since the Egyptians were not possessed of a formal astronomy until Ptolemaic times. It almost seems as if the Egyptians were content to view the heavenly bodies as deities whose motions were too sacred to be reduced to mundane numbers. Despite their star maps, charts, and cal- endars, when it comes to the planets and their motions, nothing has survived from pre-Alex- andrian Egypt that would allow us to claim an astronomical achievement on their part. On the other hand, if conventional mythologists can treat of deities like Horus and Ra as solar representations, with the likes of Isis and Hathor as lunar or Venerian ones, then so are we allowed to treat them as celestial bodies. In fact, as already noted, ask any mythologist to name the solar god par excellence and the name of Ra (or Re) is bound to come up. Not only is Ra presented as the Egyptian sun god, he is believed to have been the Sun itself. As James Frazer echoed this Egyptological dictum: \u201cThat Ra was both the physical sun and the sun-",

In view of the ancient connections we have now dis- covered between Saturn and the Sun, we should not therefore be surprised to learn that an Egyptian ostrakon from Ptolemaic times actually identifies Ra as the Greek Kronos, which is the planet Saturn.'* Egyptologists, of course, will object, pointing out that this is such a late, and isolated, case, stemming, no less, from Greek interpretation, that the datum should not be given any credence. Which is why I was surprised when it was brought to my attention\u2019 that Samuel Mercer came close to admitting something similar. In his study of the Pyramid Texts, Mercer noted that the Egyptian star designated shd.w \u201cis com- pared to and identified with Re [the same as Ra], and might have been our Saturn...\u201d'\u00ae It is, of course, the \u201cstar\u201d shd.w that Mercer thinks might have been the same as Saturn. But if shd.w was Saturn, it\u2019s identification with Ra would be telling the same story the Ptolemaic ostrakon does. Granting the uniqueness of the os- trakon in question, we at least have one direct identification of Ra as Saturn (plus a second indirect one if Mercer is correct). Besides, is it conceivable that, with the progress of astronomical sci- ence, it would have been forgotten by Ptolemaic times that Ra was the Sun? Ra, who, in Ptolemaic times, was actually identified Or had the Greeks no word for the Sun as a representative of the planet Saturn. for them to refer to it as Kronos?

And, as a qualification I should perhaps add that this does not mean that Ra never stood for the Sun. It is obvious from texts of a historical, or narrative, but not mythological, nature that the Sun was also referred to as Ra. But is this not the same situation we have found among other nations where the planet Saturn and the Sun are made to share the same name? Meanwhile, the Ptolemaic identification of Ra as Saturn is given additional credence by the Greek poet known as Nonnus. A native of Panapolis in Ptolemaic Egypt, Nonnus like- wise referred to the Arabic Sun as Kronos\u201d which, again, was the same as calling the Sun by the name of Saturn. Now it is true that the Greeks, and after them the Romans, had a penchant for calling alien deities and celestial bodies by what they understood to be their Greek, or Roman, coun- terparts. It is also known that, in certain cases, their matching was somewhat arbitrary. But neither the planet Saturn nor the Sun could have contributed to such arbitrariness since both luminaries were beyond confusion. So why would Nonnus have chosen to call the Arabic Sun by the name of the planet Saturn? Is not one inclined to assume that a similar ambiguity between the Sun and the planet Saturn must have existed in Arabic nomenclature? And does this not indicate that the Graeco-Egyptian who had it recorded that Ra stood for Kro- nos/Saturn was, in fact, echoing the popular belief of the time? The Greeks, of course, had their own lore to draw upon. Not only did they, as we have seen, refer to the planet Saturn as the star of Helios, that is the star of the Sun, they actually identified it outright as Helios. Thus, for instance, Plato (or Philip of Opus) wrote that pre- eminent among the planets for its slowness was the one whom \u201csome call ...Kronos,\u201d\"\u201d which is Saturn. But, in the earliest copies of the text, the name used was not Kronos but, rather, Helios.\" It was only later copyists, who could not understand why the planet Saturn was here being alluded to by the name of the Sun, who \u201ccorrected\u201d the text to read \u201cKronos,\u201d the \u201caccepted\u201d Greek name of the planet Saturn. As Franz Boll, whose illuminating study of this subject has long been ignored, demonstrated, the practice of \u201ccorrecting\u201d such texts\u2014changing the name \u201cHelios\u201d to read \u201cKronos\u201d\u2014was quite common among later copyists.\u201d\" To Porphyry, originally named Malchus, the Greek historian and Neoplatonist from Tyre, in Syria, Kronos/Saturn was also called Helios\u2019? as it was to Rhetorios and Claudius Ptolemy himself.\u2019\u00ae All of which further indicates that the Ptolemaic identification of Ra as Kronos/Saturn was in keeping with the belief of the time. As it happens, the name \u201cHelios\u201d closely resembles the Greek transliteration of the Ca- naanite/Phoenician \u201cEl,\u201d that is \u201cElos,\u201d a deity who, as Philo Byblius proclaimed, was the same as Kronos/Saturn.'* Thus a confusion between the names Elos and Helios has been suggested to be at the root of this belief.\"\u00b0 This point is somewhat tacky because, in my opinion, the Greek Helios, together with similar divinities incorporating the same philol- ogical root, does ultimately derive from El.

Besides, as Boll pointed out, and as we have seen, the association of Saturn with the Sun was much too widespread to be attributed to a Greek confusion based on Philo.\"\u00b0 Boll\u2019s own conclusion was that the naming of the planet Saturn as Helios was not due to any confusion of names, and hardly a confusion of the luminaries involved, but owed its cause to the simple fact that, originally, Helios and Kronos were one and the same god and, therefore, one and the same planet\u2014that is Saturn.\u201d Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius, the Roman philosopher and grammarian who lived between 395 and 423 A.D., has been much maligned for claiming, in the first book of his Saturnalia, that all forms of worship derived from that of the Sun. Among the misconcep- tions that are laid at his door is his identification of Kronos as the Sun.\" But, having learned what we now have, can we honestly say that Macrobius was that much in error? Was he not, in his own way, reporting what his ancestors, and those of the Greeks before them, had be- lieved\u2014that Saturn bore the name of the Sun?\" Should we fault him for believing that this sun was the same Sun that shone daily above his head? Have we not now seen that most modern mythologists have been trapped into committing the same error? This belief was so inbred in the early sciences it even turns up in alchemy, the foster- mother of chemistry. When astrology embraced, and thus debased, what had commenced as a monopolized industry in the transformation of base metals into gold-simulating alloys by the priestly caste of Alexandria, ancient astronomical lore entrenched itself in mystical treatises that were to obsess alchemists well past medieval times. Among these astro-chemical echoes we encounter the statement that the planet Saturn constitutes \u201cthe best sun,\u201d which reminds us of Saturn as the \u201ctrue sun\u201d believed in by Hindu sages. As David Talbott well realized: \u201c...it is unlikely that [the alchemists] themselves knew what to do with the idea. But that the tradition was passed down from remote antiquity is both indisputable and crucial.\u201d This belief was so deeply entrenched that the Swiss psychologist, Carl Jung, could refer to Saturn as \u201cthe second sun\u201d as if the oddity was well known. '\u201d FIRST INTERLUDE The handing down of traditions from remote antiquity of which Talbott speaks above does not, however, explain the tenacity with which ancient man has held to the idea that Sat- urn was a sun. Neither does it explain how the belief itself originated. So that, despite the fact that ideas do travel over distance, across geographical boundaries, and through time, from centuries to millennia, it is not easy to understand why a belief in something that was obvi- ously not so could have survived the advertency of the ages. It is therefore not enough to maintain that this belief owes its spread to diffusion, cultural contact, or wholesale borrowing, because, for one thing, we are not here concerned with an idea that would readily have lent itself to popular appeal.

        "main_text": "astronomical belief, something that the common man in the street would not have cared about except as a curiosity. In this respect, it was no different then than it is now. Granted that religion would have augmented the belief until it fossilized itself into a credo of faith, the question of why such an obvious falsity would have been incorporated in ritual litanies in the first place remains unanswered. More amazing is the fact that the belief survived the scrutiny of those who were in the best position to know otherwise\u2014the as- tronomers and astrologers. How could these professional men have attempted to utilize the datum in a more practical way when the belief on which it was based belied reality. We can, perhaps, understand how an error in astronomical observation, or a miscalculated set of figures, could have been misconstrued into a truth. Habitual acceptance of such a mis- construed fact might even, in time, have cemented the misconception into dogmatic belief. It happens. But the incongruity of a belief in something which was demonstrably false would have had a difficult time in being accepted as dogma by a culture and installed as a pillar of astrological wisdom supposedly based on astronomical verity. It is difficult to understand why ancient astronomers, astrologers, or priests looked up at the planet Saturn and asserted that it was a sun. More difficult to believe would be that such a preposterous idea, even if it was somehow believed in, say, by the Babylonians, could have been foisted on a people of a different culture. Everyone could look up into the sky and see that Saturn was not a sun. One need not have been an astronomer in order to expose such a deceit. What people might have believed is that Saturn could have once shone as a sun. This would have been different because although everyone could see that Saturn did not shine as a sun, there was no way they could tell whether it once did. And, let us face it, man has long been prone to the possibility that things could have been different in remote antiq- uity\u2014which renders this very study beyond exception. On the other hand, whether imbedded in fact or fiction, every belief has to have an origin. So what could have been the origin of this particular one? One explanation offered by Pin- gree is that the Sun\u2019s hyposoma sets as Saturn\u2019s rises.\u201d A hyposoma\u2014plural, hyposo- mata\u2014is the astrological term for the point in the zodiacal sign in which a planet is believed to exert its greatest influence. But, as Ulla Koch- Westenholz noted, \u201cthe earliest evidence for the hyposomata is from the seventh century BC,\u201d and the association of Saturn and the sun is certainly older and far more entrenched in the tradition than warranted by such arcane speculations.\u201d The classicist R. Beck had a different explanation. As he had it stated: \u201cIn ancient astrology it is widely attested...that Saturn was the star of the Sun...Graeco-Roman astrology made the [same] identification because Babylonian astrology had made it already, and the western tradition here simply drew on its older eastern relative.\u201d But the Babylonians and, before them, the Sumerians, had absolutely no reason to invent the postulate, to perpetrate this astronomical lie. It could have served no purpose\u2014religious, political, or otherwise. It would not have answered any questions posed by theology, sover- eignty, or nature. Besides, if we are to invoke diffusion as a solution to this problem, how would we explain similar beliefs from the American continent which, we have been taught, could have had absolutely no contact with the world of the ancient Near East? I will not, at",

        "main_text": "this point, delve into Mesoamerican lore to uphold the thesis being developed, since I would like to reserve that for a later part of this work. But it would do no harm here to note that in analysing the Mayan holy book known as the Popul Vuh, which, among other things, deals with the glowing face of the sun, it comes out unreservedly that certainly it was not the same sun which we see.'\u201d Would it then be too much to consider what appears to be the only other alternative\u2014that what the ancients believed was indeed what they, or their ancestors, had actually seen and experienced? Before we answer that question, let us consider one additional point. The ancients did not merely maintain that Saturn was, or had been, a sun. They alluded to it as such as if it was, or once had been, general knowledge; as if everyone knew that this was, or had been, the case. No explanations, clarifications, or qualified rationalizations are ever encountered to account for the phenomenon. But, whether speaking of the Saturnian god as distinct from his lumin- ary or of the luminary that was Saturn itself, it was always accepted that deity and planet, which in reality were one, coruscated, or had once coruscated, as a true sun. Personally, this was one aspect concerning the Saturnian phenomenon which further convinced me that not only did the ancients mean exactly what they \u201csaid,\u201d but that they probably knew what they were \u201ctalking\u201d about. But what, exactly, did this amount to? At this point we had best lay the cards we have so far accumulated plainly on the table. We have, I believe, supplied ample evidence (and more will be forthcoming in the chapters that follow) to indicate that the ancients believed Saturn to have once radiated as a sun. As Hodder Westropp and Staniland Wake had concluded long before Jastrow on studying an- cient symbolism, as far as the ancients were concerned, Saturn was the first irradiator of light.'\u00a5 But a question we posed earlier remains unanswered. This concerns the sharing of names between Saturn and the Sun. But then, what is true\u2014that Saturn was given the former name of the Sun, or that the Sun was given the former name of Saturn? Boll seems to have had no doubts about this. As far as he was concerned, the Greek Hel- ios and the Latin Sol were originally the names of the planet Saturn.\u201d Here I would like to mention the cult of Sol Invictus, the Unconquered Sun, which did not gain significant ascen- dancy until the third century A. D. Both the cult and the festivals associated with it were es- tablished by the Emperor Aurelian (Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, also known as Elagabalus) and celebrated on the 25th of December\u2019\u00ae\u201d\u2014what to the Western World today is Christmas. As Roger Wescott asked, why would the Sun have been deemed unconquered. \u201cThe common assumption about this theonymic phrase,\u201d wrote Wescott, \u201cis that it could be loosely equated with \u2018the invincible sun\u2019.\u201d*' Wescott, however, was \u201cinclined\u201d to take the term literally. In which case the question could be asked: Was there also a cult of Sol Victus\u2014\u201cthe conquered Sun\u201d? As Wescott concluded: \u201cAlthough this latter phrase [i.e. Sol Victus] does not occur in Roman literature, the phrase Sol Indigetes is found, referring to an older sun-god.\u201d\u201d It can therefore be conjectured that in each case where Saturn and the Sun share the same name, the name originally belonged to Saturn. This suspicion moves closer to certainty when we realize that, while every major ancient name of the Sun was also bestowed on Saturn, not every ancient name of the planet Saturn was bestowed on the Sun. The certainty grows when,",

But, because we suspect that the reader may not be entirely satisfied with the evidence we have so far presented, we will seek to test the postulate further by anal- yzing what else the ancients had to offer on the subject because, if their sun of ages was Sat- ur rather than the present Sun, their traditions should also reflect conditional astronomical differences.

He was honored as a sun of night.\u2019 Students of Egyptian mythology have long grappled with the exact meaning that lies hidden beneath this strange characteristic. The best that Wallis Budge could offer by way of an explanation was that Atum, whom he referred to by the name\u2019s former reading of Temu, was the Sun after it had set.\u201d By this he meant to imply that the Egyptians worshipped the Sun even when it was absent from the sky. Sun worship at night, however, makes for an incongruous institution. This fallacious interpretation should never have been derived, and it would not have, had the Egyptologists thought of comparing their texts more diligently with those in the hands of the Assyriologists. There has never been any doubt that, as far as the Egyptians themselves were concerned, Atum \u201cwas held to be one of the forms of the great Sun-god Ra...\u201d* For the time being, we shall not bother ourselves with Budge\u2019s contention that Atum was the personification of the setting Sun,\u2018 especially since, elsewhere, Atum is described as tising. * As we shall see, both these terms\u2014i.e. \u201crising\u201d and \u201csetting\u201d \u2014are based on mistranslations which will be clarified later on. Budge was also of the opinion that Atum \u201cwas originally the local god of the city of Annu, or Heliopolis,\u201d\u00ae and that only later was he assimilated with Ra. While this seems to have really been the case, it must not be assumed that the assimilation was an arbitrary one. This assimilation resulted in the double god known as Atum-Ra (or Ra-Atum)\u2019 as indicated in the hymn contained in the Papyrus of Mut-hetep\u00ae and elsewhere. Here, perhaps, we could add that Ra was also worshipped by the same name in Mesopotamia, although his Semitic equivalent, El, was more popular.\u201d This should not surprise us. Far away in Tahiti, the sun-god was also known by the name of Ra.\u201d Thus, in Semitic, Babylon was rendered Bab-el, which translates as \u201cGate of El.\u201d The non-Semitic Kassites, however, seem to have referred to the city as Ka-ra, in which \u201cra\u201d stood for the Semitic El.",

George Rawlinson, writing in 1885, who did not accept the identification of god with planet, had this to say concerning this ancient belief: \u201cThe identification of the Chaldean II [i.e. El] or Ra with Saturn, which Diodorus makes, and which may seem to derive some confirmation from Philo-Byblius, is cer- tainly incorrect, so far as the planet Saturn, which Diodorus especially mentions, is concerned; but it may be regarded as having a basis of truth, inasmuch as Saturn was in one sense the chief of the gods...\u201d\u201d\u201d This, however, seems to have been the bane of mythologists from day one, in that they have always had the audacity to proclaim that, thousands of years after the fact, they are in a better position to know what the ancients believed than the very ancients themselves. Given all this, may we not assume that Atum, who was but a facet of Ra, had also originated as a personification of the planet Saturn.? But then, if Atum was honored as a sun of night, should we not expect that so, also, had been Ra? This is exactly what we find. In a hymn, Ra is lauded as \u201cthe one alone... lying awake while all men lie asleep.\u201d And if some find that somewhat ambiguous, it is made clearer in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, where the god in question is unambiguously made to state: \u201cI am that god Re who shineth in the night.\u201d Besides Atum and Ra, this sun of night was also anthropomorphosed by the Egyptians as the god Osiris. Mariette-Bey long ago wrote that: \u201cOriginally, Osiris is the nocturnal sun; he is the primordial night of chaos; he is consequently anterior to Ra, the Sun of Day.\u201d* As we have already seen, however, Ra, also, was considered a sun of night so that, in this respect,",

Granted that Mullen\u2019s equation may be considered as somewhat indefinite, there are other indications that both Atum and Ra were directly associated with Osiris. Thus, in a vignette of the Book of the Dead, as elsewhere, the disk of Ra, usually said to be that of the Sun, is shown resting on the pillar known as Djed (or Tet) which was the emblem of Osiris.\u201d Else- where in the same work, Atum is made to utter: \u201cI am yesterday.\u201d But a few lines later it is stated that: \u201cYesterday is Osiris.\u201d\u00ae But let\u2019s cut across the lawn since the very same work leaves little doubt as to the equation of Ra with Osiris. In the liturgy for the dead, it is asked\u2014and answered: \u201c*Who then is this? It is Osiris,\u2019 or (as others say), Ra is his name, even Ra the self- created.\u201d In other sections of the same work, Ra is presented as the soul of Osiris, while Osiris is presented as the soul of Ra, thus again indicating that the two gods were merely aspects of each other.\u201d As Lepsius pointed out, in the Book of the Dead, Osiris is even referred to as Osiris-Ra, while Isis, who was the wife of Osiris, is even there called \u201cthe royal consort of Ra.\u201d It was precisely this assimilation with Ra that drove earlier mythologists to equate Osiris with the Sun.* James Frazer, of course, had his own reason for disagreeing with this identification since, as far as he was concerned, Osiris had been nothing more than a god of vegetation.\u201d Actually, the identification of Osiris as a Saturnian deity, and even as a personification of the planet Saturn itself, is anything but new, having been proffered by many a mythologist.\u201d Immanuel Velikovsky was much in agreement with this identification.\u201d Few of these writers, however, ever presented any direct evidence that ties Osiris to Saturn. William Heidel was at least shrewd enough to point out that, just as Osiris was considered the judge of the dead, so, also, was Kronos/Saturn.\u201d But it is not this or that particular datum that makes our case, but, rather, the collective weight of various clues and diligent reasoning. And to add to what we have already enumerated, I offer next the following information which refers us back to En- Me Sar-ra, that epithet of Shamash/Saturn which, as we have already seen, means \u201cLord of the Law of the Universe.\u201d The Indic Brahma, whom we have already seen identified as the same planet, was also honored as the \u201cLord of the Universe.\u201d\u201d It could not then be through coincidence that another name for Osiris happens to be Neb-er-tcher, which also means \u201cgod of the universe.\u201d\u00ae",

Or why were there so many names\u2014and we shall be meeting many others\u2014within the same nation for one and the same planet? Once again, I will let Mullen answer this one\u2014at least in part. As he wrote: \u201cOne cause for the complexity of the account is that when the Nile valley was united in one kingdom, it consisted of many tribes, each with its own names for the planetary gods and its own stories about them. After unification the cults of these gods were preserved and conflated even though in many cases one and the same planet was being worshipped under different names in different places.\u201d\u201d As time went by, the ancestral memory of these former times dimmed. In Egypt, the sac- red litanies continued to be chanted even when a full understanding of their content was part- ially lost. Eventually, even the identities of the gods were forgotten; and were it not for the present-day rediscoveries of ancient texts, we would be in no better position. In Egypt, a time came when not only were planetary deities worshipped under different names in different places, but also in the very same nomes under the roof of the very same temples. When one remembers that this evolutionary process took place, not only in Egypt, but throughout the entire world, one begins to appreciate the complexity of the mytho-historical record and the reason behind the legion of names which now burden the gods of humankind. All of which reminds us of Fred Bratton\u2019s words when he had it stated that: \u201cIt has been es- timated that a list of Sumerian deities [alone] would contain more than five thousand names.\u201d Add to that the thousands of deities from other ancient civilizations and the mind boggles. Let us face it, we are here talking about an astronomical number of divinities. Could we really hope to attach them all to just five planets, those which the ancients could see with the naked eye? And yet, as we saw on an earlier page, that is precisely what Giorgio de San- tillana and Hertha von Dechend claimed: \u201cThe real actors on the stage of the universe are few, if their adventures are many...The forces reside in the starry heavens, and all the stories, characters and ad-",

        "main_text": "ventures narrated by mythology concentrate on the active powers among the stars, who are the planets. A prodigious assignment it may seem for those few planets to account for all those stories...\u201d\u00b0 A prodigious assignment it surely is, but not an entirely impossible one because, for one thing, many of these deities turn out to be nothing but aliases of each other. Take Osiris, for example, seeing as we are on that subject\u2014the god was known under sixty different names in the Theban recension, up to c. 1600 B.C., % which had accumulated to one hundred and fifty- eight by the time of the Saite recension in c. 300 B.C.* In the Babylonian Enuma Elish, sometimes referred to as the Babylonian Creation Epic, the god Marduk is given fifty names.* And if you think that these two examples constitute extremes, think again. The In- dic god Shiva is claimed to bear one thousand and eight different names.\u201d In fact, it will be found that most of the deities of antiquity are merely aliases of each other. Nor will I be bold enough to proclaim that all these mythological characters are to be identified as planets since some actually personify planetary powers, while others are associated with various celestial phenomena. But, before we lose the thread of our present topic, another question should now be asked: Was it only in Egypt that Saturn was lauded as a sun of night? THE BABYLONIAN EXEMPLAR Actually, there is undeniable evidence that the concept of a night sun existed in ancient Babylonian thought as well. As Morris Jastrow indicated, Saturn and the Sun were viewed as the \u201ctwo chief lights of the heaven, one to serve during the day and the other at night.\u201d\u2122 This is indicated by the fact, mentioned in the previous chapter, that when the Sun was in- tended, a gloss to that effect\u2014SamSe u-mi (ie. Shamash of the day)\u2014was inserted in those astrological texts dealing with Shamash/Saturn.\u201d A Shamash-of-the-day presupposes a Shamash-of-the-night. As Jastrow expressed this idea: \u201cStrange as it may seem to us, the planet Saturn appears to have been regarded as \u2018the sun of night\u2019 corresponding to Samai as \u2018the sun of the daytime\u2019 and the cause of such light as the night furnishes.\u201d It was only when trying to explain this phenomenon that Jastrow stumbled: \u201cTt was argued, that since there was a sun furnishing the light of day, so there must be some corresponding power which causes the illuminations of the heaven at night.",

        "main_text": "Saturn was chosen\u2014in preference even to the moon\u2014because of the slowness of its movement, which made it visible continuously for a long period.\u201d As if there are no other stars in the heaven that are \u201cvisible continuously for a long per- iod\u201d of time, or none that are brighter than Saturn! Besides, what has the slowness of a planet to do with its brightness? Jastrow went on to state that the light of the Moon, as well as that of the other planets and the stars, was, by the Babylonians, ascribed to Saturn.\u201d But would the Babylonians, who could calculate the complex motions of the heavenly bodies with mathematical accuracy, as we have seen in a previous chapter, have been so naive as to invent a concept in which even the most ignorant of their peasantry could hardly have believed? Should we not rather believe the words of Diodorus when he stated that the reason the Chaldeans called Saturn by the name of the Sun was because it was the most prominent of the five planets or the stars? A colleague of Jastrow, Professor J. A. Montgomery, has even raised \u201cthe interesting question whether in Genesis 1:16 the two \u2018lights\u2019 may not at one time have referred to the Sun and Saturn?\u201d\u00ae Without realizing that the second body might have been Saturn, James Strickling also suggested a similar interpretation.\u201c While I do not wish to use this particular datum as evidence of anything, I have to admit that it is an interesting supposition for, in the Biblical passage referred to, which supposedly describes the creation of Sun and Moon, nei- ther Sun nor Moon is mentioned. The passage merely reads: \u201cAnd Elohim [usually translated as \u2018God\u2019] made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the jesser light to rule the night: He made the stars also.\u201d* NOCTURNAL DEITIES Well down into the present era, the ancient belief in a former nocturnal sun continued to resurface in art. A floor mosaic, showing Helios riding in his four-horse chariot, was discov- ered at the Beth Alpha Synagogue, dating to the sixth century A.D., in Israel\u2019s Jezreel Valley. In it, the god is depicted riding through the night, with the Moon and a sky \u201csprinkled with stars\u201d behind him. The incongruity has been explained by claiming that \u201c[t]he night sky...still shines around him.\u201d\u201d At no time, however, can the night sky continue to shine around the Sun once it has risen. In view of the fact that Helios was originally interchange- able with Kronos/Saturn, the mosaic in question should be allowed to speak for itself. What it portrays is Helios as Saturn shining at night. Carl Jung, among few, understood this much. He, too, had come across references to a sun of night. As he wrote of the Latin Sol: \u201c[T]here is...also a Sol niger [that is \u201cblack sun,\u201d which makes us think of what we earlier noted concerning \u201cblack Saturn\u201d], which, significantly enough, is contrasted with the day-time sun and clearly distinguished from it.\u201d\u201d The Celtic tradition preserved in Irish and Welsh texts dates no earlier than the eighth century A.D. That it incorporates much earlier beliefs, which had been handed down orally",

        "main_text": "since time immemorial, has never however been doubted. Unfortunately, the ancient tales were written down in their present form by early Christian monks who saw fit to turn the an- cient gods into men of flesh and blood. Such was Balor, he of the single flaming eye, whose name is ultimately derived from bhel, and thus equivalent to Beli or Bel. He who once had been a celestial divinity was turned into a terrestrial king. Despite this metamorphosis, even though the idea has not been widely accepted, the characteristics of Balor have been com- pared to those of the Sun.\u201d That Balor, however, had been a nocturnal sun is indicated by his title. He was known as the King of Night. \u00ae THE GOD OF SATURDAY NIGHT As befitted his nocturnal station, Osiris was venerated in a festival which took place at night. \u201cHerodotus tells us that the grave of Osiris was at Sais in Lower Egypt, and that there was a lake there upon which the sufferings of the god were displayed as a mystery by night. This commemoration of the divine passion was held once a year...and an im- age of a cow, made of gilt with a golden sun between its horns, was carried out of the chamber in which it stood the rest of the year...A great feature of the festival was the nocturnal illumination. People fastened rows of oil-lamps to the outside of their houses, and the lamps burned all night long. The custom was not confined to Sais, but was observed throughout the whole of Egypt.\u201d\u201d Another celebration connected with Osiris was the Sed festival which has been claimed to be the oldest Egyptian feast of which we yet retain a trace. James Frazer has suggested that the ritual, which is known to have been celebrated until the end of the Roman period, was as old as Egypt itself. This particular event was held every thirty years\u2014which makes it signifi- cant since thirty years is the period of Saturn\u2019s revolution around the Sun. As Frazer himself states, this correlation of the Sed festival with the planet\u2019s revolution has been noticed, and commented upon, by several scholars before him. Since then, the subject has been ap- proached again by de Santillana and von Dechend, although here the authors present Ptah, rather than Osiris, as the \u201cinventor\u201d of the festival, even though they themselves identify Ptah as \u201cthe Egyptian Saturn.\u201d* The Sed, of course, was a royal jubilee festival which the pharaoh held after having reigned thirty years. Lucky was the pharaoh who could celebrate two such jubilees. Nor was this custom unique to Egypt. The Persian Shahs, who traced their lineage from the towering figures of the mythical kings\u2014Kai Kubad, Kai Ka\u2019us, and Kai Khusrau\u2014also celebrated their royal jubilee after having reigned thirty years\u2014a fact that did not escape the attention of de Santillana and von Dechend.* Meanwhile, a curious tale comes our way through Apuleius who tells us that, when being initiated into the mysteries of Isis, wife of Osiris, a certain Lucius was given \u201cto see the sun",

Another nocturnal feast, as brought to my attention by Roger Ashton, is also held in some parts of India when the thirteenth day of a lunar fortnight happens to fall on a Saturday. In Sanskrit, the day of Saturday is called Shanivar which, Shani being Saturn, translates as \u201cSaturn\u2019s Day.\u201d Actually, Saturday was the day held sacred to Saturn among more than one ancient nation and, to this day, it continues to bear the planet\u2019s name not only in Sanskrit. To the Jews, Saturday is Shabbath (the Sabbath), which word is sometimes said to derive from the closely related shabath, which means \u201cto repose\u201d or \u201cto rest.\u201d In fact, however, the Sabbath is named in honor of Saturn which, in Hebrew, is called Shabtai.\u201d The word sha- bath\u2014\"to repose\u201d \u2014is then traceable to the same root, derived because Elohim was said to have rested from creation on that day.* In Italian, Saturday is rendered Sabato, derived from Hebrew through the Greek Sabbaton. In Maltese, Saturday is called Sibt, derived from the same Semitic root. The English name Saturday is itself a contraction of the Saxon Saterne\u2019s Day (or Daeg) from the Latin Saturni Dies. Even in Indo-China, and more specifically Cam- bodia, Saturday is named in honor of Prah Sau, which is the planet Saturn.\u201d Now while it is true that not every ceremony that is celebrated on a Saturday has to be Saturnian in character and/or origin, the Indian ceremony mentioned above is itself called Shani Pradosh.\u00ae Since pradosh means \u201cnight,\u201d the festival in question is translatable as \u201cSaturn\u2019s Night.\u201d A ceremony called Saturn\u2019s Night held in the evening of Saturn\u2019s Day is not just any ceremony conducted on a Saturday; it is obviously one conducted in honor of Saturn. Thus it was that, among other things, Saturn became known as the Lord of the Sabbath,\u201d a belief which finds a curious echo in Persian cosmogony. As Al-Biruni, an Arabian scholar of the 11th century A.D., tells us: \u201cOn the 6th day of Farwardin, the day Khurdadh, is the great Nauroz, for the Persians a feast of great importance. On this day\u2014they say\u2014God finished the creation, for it is the last of the six days...On this day God created Saturn...\u201d* The pre-Islamic feast of Nauroz\u2014or Naw Ruz, as it is sometimes transliterated\u2014continues to be celebrated unto this day on the eve of the Persian New Year which traditionally takes place on the first day of spring. It continues to be celebrated not only in Iran (i.e. ancient Per- sia) but everywhere that Iranians, Afghanis, Kashmiris, Kurds, and Zoroastrians (i.e. Parsis)",

And yet how many of these celebrants have an inkling that what they are really celebrating originated as a Saturnian festi- val? Of added interest is the fact that, like other festivals of its kind, the feast of Nauroz is celebrated at night; the festivities commence the minute the Sun goes down. Of course it will be pointed out that, being a New Year\u2019s Eve festival, its celebration at night would be logical. In fact, whether celebrated as New Year festivals or not, there is really nothing strange about the fact that Saturnian festivals were conducted at night. After all, in today\u2019s skies, it is at night that Saturn shines, as so it must have shone in ancient times. But, we ask, as a sun? If we are to believe our ancient forefathers, it seems that such was the case. Even if one should disregard all this and assume, against all logic, that such an astro- nomical fantasy would have, through diffus- ion, been dispersed around the ancient world and accepted as a truth, how can one explain the migration of this idea across the waters of the Atlantic? For, according to Eric Thompson, even in Mesoamerica do we en- counter this persistent belief in a night sun. At this point we can add Hypothesis #2 to the effect that, still according to the an- cients, the primeval Saturnian sun shone during that time we today call the night. The question that should now be asked is: Is it possible that the planet we know as Saturn could have once radiated as a sun? Or what does astronomy and/or astrophysics have to offer concerning such a possibility?",

This core was believed to be surrounded by a voluminous ocean of compressed and liquefied gases which, in turn, merged into an atmosphere of hydrogen. It was \u201cknown\u201d that the planet could not be emitting heat from its own internal source. With a core of ice, obviously, this would have been impossible. Ther- mocouple measurements had in fact detected a very low temperature in the region of -130 to -155\u00b0C.! As with Jupiter, so with Saturn. The similar nature of these two planets was stressed. Temperatures on Saturn were estimated as being extremely low, approximately -150\u00b0C.2 What an embarrassing difference from the picture that emerged less than a year later! Of course, as usual, there was no consensus among astronomers and some were painting pictures of a Jupiter with a much hotter interior. F. R. Moulton, for example, was speaking of Jupiter\u2019s internal heat as early as 1910.3 It will not be found stated in current scientific lit- erature, but Immanuel Velikovsky was alluding to both Jupiter and Satum as \u201cdark stars\u201d by 1950.4 This was not based on the scenario of his book, Worlds in Collision, in which the statement appeared, but on earlier events presented in a prequel to that work, which prequel remains unpublished to this day.5 It is not that I uphold either of Velikovsky\u2019s scenarios; I do not. But I am not about the throw the baby out with the bath water. Credit should be given where due. In any case, Velikovsky was not alone. By 1962, E. J. Opik had calculated that Jupiter radiated from 1.2 to 2.0 times the energy it receives from the Sun.\u00ae As Ralph Juergens pointed out: \u201cIndeed, speculation that Jupiter is a dying star, radiating away internal heat, goes back more than a century.\u201d\u201d POTTED STARS In 1967, Val Axel Firsoff brought to the attention of astronomers, of whom he was one, the reality of the deep convective atmosphere of these planets. He stressed the fact that, in such an environment, temperatures tend to decline upwards at a steady rate. With the known composition of such atmospheres, this steady rate could be determined. He thus calculated",

This would be akin to the surface temperature of cool stars.8 \u201cIndeed,\u201d wrote Firsoff, \u201cJupiter does emit microwave radiations corresponding to such temperatures.\u201d Allowing for some thermonuclear reactions to proceed at a slow rate in their central regions, and shielded as they are by their vast opaque and cold atmospheres, Firsoff assumed that stellar temperatures could easily obtain inside the Jovian planets. As he con- cluded: \u201cThey would thus be in the nature of \u2018potted stars\u2019.\u201d9 By then, even the renowned Gerald Kuiper was referring to Jupiter as a star and the Sun-Jupiter system as a binary. !\u00b0 FAILED STARS December 3, 1973 is a historical date in the annals of astronomy. On that day, Pioneer 10 passed within 81,000 miles of Jupiter. Exactly a year later, Pioneer 11 skimmed within 27,000 miles of the planet\u2019s south polar region. The new data that these two space probes re- layed to Earth sent astronomers and astrophysicists scurrying back to their slide rules and calculations. Observations in the infrared had already indicated that Jupiter was much brighter than would be the case had it merely been a planet reflecting light. D. A. Allen noted that, at 5 mu, Jupiter appeared so bright that it must be radiating more energy than it could absorb from the Sun.!! \u201cWhen the long wavelength data are also included,\u201d wrote Allen, \u201cwe find that Jupiter radiates nearly three times the energy it receives.\u201d !2 As if he had been the only one or the first, D. McNally, who was then with the University of London Observatory, suggested the idea that Jupiter may be more like a star than a planet.!3 John A. Simpson, then professor of physics at the University of Chicago, described Jupiter as \u201cnature\u2019s best gift of what a poor man\u2019s star is like.\u201d!4 What the data from the Pioneer probes had disclosed was that Jupiter is a fast rotating mass of liquid hydrogen. Its convective weather seems to be driven by what physicists began to call its \u201cprimordial internal heat.\u201d As time went by, more astronomers began to talk about Jupiter\u2019s \u201cstarlike properties\u201d and its similarities to a \u201cmini-solar system.\u201d 15 \u201cBut Jupiter is definitely not a star,\u201d Henry Simmons stated and added that, although the planet\u2019s core may reach as much as 30,000\u00b0C, its temperature is \u201chundreds of times too low to ignite the thermonuclear reactions that heat the stars.\u201d!\u00a9 These giant planets, Arielle Em- met echoed him, \u201ccould not heat up enough to begin deuterium burning.\u201d !7 Firsoff did not quite agree. He stated that even the lowest assumed temperature of Jupiter\u2019s interior is adequate to initiate nuclear fusion. With deuterium, which has been dis- covered in the Jovian atmosphere, a reaction can start at 50,000\u00b0K. Lithium and beryllium burning would soon follow. \u201cThis could raise the central temperature to 1,000,000\u00b0C, re- quired for the proton-proton reaction, which is the main source of power in the Sun.\u201d !8",

PROTO-STARS By late 1980, Voyager 1 did for Saturn what the earlier Pioneers had done for Jupiter. Garry Hunt, the Voyager mission meteorologist, stated: \u201cWe have this paradox of bodies that are somewhat like stars inside but have Earth-like weather on the outside.\u201d20 It did not, of course, require Voyager 1, or the later Voyager 2, to bring this conclusion home. Writing in 1976, Simmons had already spoken for the scientific community at large When he stated that, like Jupiter, Saturn appears to emit more heat than it receives from the Sun.?! \u201cBeing further out [wrote Rick Gore], Saturn gets only a fourth the solar energy that Jupiter receives. At Jupiter the solar heat striking the atmosphere is equal to the inter- nal heat coming up. At more distant Saturn internal heating dominates. The up- welling of this heat may generate the much stronger surface winds. In any event, both planets are a theorist\u2019s delight.\u201d22 In fact, scientists found that Saturn generates bursts of energy in the one-megahertz fre- quency range. Gore described Saturn as \u201ca pale yellow giant, a turbulent ball of primordial gas that more resembles a star than the inner planets we know.\u201d24 Emmet had earlier expressed similar views. \u201cRecent observations of the giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn,\u201d he wrote, \u201clend cre- dence to earlier speculation that both were actually proto-stars.\u201d Both have a system of ac- companying satellites which have been likened to miniature solar systems. 25 Saturn\u2019s temperature was eventually given as 94.4 + 3\u00b0 K. But this, it must be pointed out, was not the assumed temperature of the planet\u2019s interior. Its total heat emission has been calculated at about 2.2 times higher than its absorbed sunlight. It was then felt that this excess heat cannot be due to residue from the planet\u2019s formative period. An internal heat source, long postulated, was therefore thought to be certain.26 In 1977 Firsoff had written that \u201cit has been obvious for many years that Saturn is heated from within.\u201d According to him, Saturn must be powered by substantially the same nuclear processes he had postulated for Jupiter.?\u201d RED DWARF STAR Dark stars, cool stars, potted stars, failed stars, proto-stars\u2014all these terms have been ap- plied to Jupiter and Saturn and more were about to be added to the list.

Is it not possible that Jupiter and Saturn had once burned as relatively miniature suns and that, through evolutionary or catastrophic processes, they became permanently dimmed? That, at least, seems to have been the final consensus as Jupiter won its place in popular books on astronomy as a body that was once much hotter. According to Roy Gallant, it would even have glowed: \u201cJupiter, two and a half times as massive as all the other planets combined, began as an enormous gas ball that contracted and heated up...But, unlike the Sun, Jupiter had far too little mass to send its core temperature high enough to start fusion reactions. Instead of reaching the millions of degrees needed, the core heated up only a few thousands of degrees. So Jupiter became only hot enough to glow cherry-red, like a red dwarf star, and for a while it bathed its inner moons in light and heat that faded as Jupiter slowly cooled.\u201d MINIATURE SUN Richard Hoagland, in his usual recklessness, was more direct. \u201cJupiter was once a minia- ture sun according to our current concepts of solar system formation,\u201d he was reported as saying. True, he then added: \u201cIt only lasted a short time\u2014a few million years at most,\u201d3\u00b0 which would also mean that it had stopped radiating millions of years ago. By 1981, Saturn was known to radiate from two to three times the energy it receives from the Sun.3! Its estimated internal temperature had by now risen to 20,000\u00b0 K.3? By then there was no doubt that both Jupiter and Saturn were in possession of internal sources of heat. Even so, as Andrew Ingersol repeated what had been preached ever since the discoveries by the Pioneer and Voyager probes, and in complete disregard of Firsoff\u2019s hypothesis, \u201cneither planet is massive enough for gravitational self-compression to have initiated nuclear fusion.\u201d The final verdict was that \u201cneither planet is a star.\u201d33 And yet, as Ingersol informed his readers, \u201cJames B. Pollack and his colleagues at the Ames Research Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have devel- oped models of the history of the giant planets and conclude that the interior of Jupiter and Saturn is still hot today.\u201d34 But then the extra heat was explained away: \u201cModels of the cooling of Jupiter over the history of the Solar System account for all the power that Jupiter is radiating today in excess of the amount it absorbs.\u201d35 When it came to Saturn, however, the models in question fell short. FAILED MODEL Ingersoll himself had to admit that: \u201cSimilar models fail, however, to account for about a third of the excess that Saturn tadiates. Apparently Saturn has asource of internal heat not included in the",

Is it not simply because Sat- urn\u2019s total heat emission turned out to be significantly higher than had been predicted from models of the planet\u2019s cooling history?38 Should not this model, then, have been discarded? After all, Jupiter\u2019s excess ratio of internal heat over solar input is just about identical to that of Saturn.39 One is therefore led to believe that the internal heat of both planets must be due to near-identical causes. Or was the source of the internal heat of the two planets variously given for each of them because no single model could be found to account for both of them? As it turned out, for its size, Saturn was found to be more star-like than Jupiter, emitting more heat than Jupiter, overall being much more active than Jupiter. Writing in 1985, Leroy Ellenberger did not quite agree. As he summed the situation up: \u201cAll of the handwaving about Jupiter and Saturn being \u2018failed\u2019 or \u2018dark\u2019 stars notwithstanding, the great preponderance of present astronomical thinking, which is supported by detailed computations, indicates that planets are planets and stars are stars. That Jupiter and Saturn are failed stars is an obsolete idea.\u201d That was Ellenberger\u2019s scholarly opinion. We, on the other hand, beg to differ. BROWN DWARFS By 1983, Jupiter had received a new tag; it was now pigeon-holed as a brown dwarf, the nature of which was best explained in layman\u2019s terms by Rick Gore: \u201cWhen a gas cloud along a galaxy\u2019s spiral arm is compressed, it will collapse under its own gravity and ignite as a star if the clump has sufficient mass; if less that one- tenth the mass of our sun, it may become a \u2018brown dwarf.\u2019 Jupiter is such an object, too small to \u2018turn on\u2019 by nuclear fusion but still shedding heat from its collapse. Brown dwarfs cannot be seen at great distances but may well account for a large part of a galaxy\u2019s mass.\u201d42 Much more recently, the touted discovery of extra-solar planets have been given astro- physicists enough headaches. One such headache is that, if their theorizing is all that correct, some of these planets, with masses equal or greater than that of Jupiter, orbit much too close",

As Sam Flamsteed reported: \u201cOne possible explanation would be that these are not planets at all but brown dwarf stars. A brown dwarf is about as close as a star can get to being a planet without ac- tually being one. For one thing, it is small enough to be mistaken for a very large planet, at least from a distance. And since, being small, its core is not put under enough pressure for nuclear reactions to take hold, it emits only a dim glow at first and then gradually goes dark.\u201d43 \u201cTheorists have always assumed that brown dwarfs must be at least ten times more massive than Jupiter and probably more. But perhaps they\u2019ve overestimated. Maybe a brown dwarf can be six times as massive as Jupiter or even less.\u201d But, as Flamsteed was shrewd enough to notice: \u201cTo assume that the theorists are baffled, is to underestimate them badly. A good as- tronomical theorist never lets the complete absence of information stand in the way of a nice theory and, conversely, never gets thrown when an actual observation arrives to spoil it. Lack of data can actually be an advantage. Unhindered by facts, some theorist is bound to have come up with a model that explains even the strangest discovery.\u201d45 In their attempt to explain the anomalous behaviour of the extra-solar planets that every- one started discovering all over the place,\u201c it was even conjectured that there was enough material in these systems \u201cto make planets ten times bigger than Earth.\u201d Objects of such size, it has been theorized, would be in possession of such gravitational fields powerful enough \u201cto act like a gigantic vacuum cleaner.\u201d Such objects tend to suck in \u201cwhatever nearby gas is left over.\u201d And the result? \u201cIn a mere 10,000 years or so you have Jupiter\u2014a rocky core ten times the size of earth surrounded by an immense atmosphere 35,000 miles thick.\u201d4\u201d Apart from Jupiter-sized planets, this hypothesis was later applied to both Jupiter and Saturn themselves.\u201c All of which might make one ask: If a Jupiter-sized planet can form in an extra-solar system in 10,000 years or so, how can anyone be positively certain that Jupiter itself, or for that matter Saturn, did not take a similarly short time to form? And if that is al- lowed as a possibility, then how can one be positively certain that Jupiter and Saturn are bil- lions of years old? Even more was yet to come. After having been so sure they knew just about everything they needed to know about Jupiter, astronomers were in for yet more surprises when Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacted the planet in July of 1994. In analyzing the aftermath of the impact, they discovered that the planet has far less water than had been expected; the three predicted layers of the atmosphere were not detected; strong winds were found to be present at all levels of the atmosphere; and the amount of helium turned out to be only half of what had been theorized.",

Finally \u2014one more surprise; but not from any new discovery. This one came from the as- trophysicists themselves. While Saturn\u2019s excess heat has been relegated to kinetic energy re- leased by the circulation of dissolved helium, the lack of helium was now being blamed for Jupiter\u2019s internal warmth.*? Go figure. SECOND INTERLUDE The last thing I wish to be accused of is that I apply the above information to improper use. So first let me state that, as the references themselves indicate, the information in ques- tion comes untampered from purely scientific sources. Nor am I here advocating that either Jupiter or Saturn could sustain nuclear reactions in their cores. Not even Firsoff dared go that far. But such reactions as Firsoff claimed possible were never specified as having to be, or having been, sustained. The very nature of the mytho-historical evidence I presented in the preceding chapters itself negates this possibility. Obviously, so does the present state of these two planets. Had such reactions been sustained, Jupiter and Saturn would still be flooding the night with their radiated light. To an extent, even Ellenberger is correct. Jupiter and Saturn do fail as stars, but only in their present condition. Although it is my belief, and that of a few others, that Saturn was a true sun\u2014which means that it radiated its own light rather than having reflected that of the Sun as it does now\u2014it must not be understood that it shone with a continuous blinding light. Ancient sources impel us to believe that, although brighter than the Moon at night, Saturn was not as bright as the Sun. In fact, as will be indicated in a future work, additional evidence indicates that, during the day, Saturn paled in comparison to the Sun. It should also be kept in mind that I am not here attempting to make a case for Saturn having been highly luminous in historical times, despite the fact that I have cited historical sources as evidence. It must be stressed that these sources allude to past events\u2014that is, even though themselves ancient, their allusion is to an even older system. In actual fact, my con- tention is that Saturn shone as a nocturnal sun in prehistoric times\u2014that is before the age of writing. The stretch from prehistoric to historic times is measurable in only a few thousand years so that a critic would be absolutely correct in arguing that this does not change the fact that, for both planets in question, their luminous phase is believed to have terminated billions of years ago. While this is the generally accepted view, it can actually be safely stated that Jupiter is still slightly luminous. At Jupiter\u2019s size\u2014 and mass\u2014has it not occurred to any- one that something might be wrong with this implied rate of decreasing luminosity had degeneration really commenced billions of years ago? And, by the same token, could not the same be said for its implied rate of cooling? Where the presently accepted scientific tenets and the hypothesis presented in this work differ is precisely in this time factor. And here, as long as one accepts current theory, the hy- pothesis must falter. But is currently accepted theory necessarily correct? How often have we been cocksure of matters which turned out not to be so? Were astrophysicists not, until a few years ago, paint-",

Need I burden the reader with a long list of astro- nomical certainties which have only yesterday, so it seems, turned into myth?>! I am not raking mud as an exercise in scientific embarrassment. I do realize that this is the way science is meant to progress\u2014by replacing old \u201ctruths\u201d with new and, where possible, theory with fact. Let not what I am about to state next be misconstrued into a fundamentalist stance. Noth- ing could be further from the truth. But, in the past, geologists and astronomers have steadily increased the age of Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe surrounding them. Is it ac- cepted that not a single new discovery can ever make them reverse the process? Personally, I have no recourse but to admit that the entire hypothesis presented in this work hinges on historical and mytho-historical sources. But before anyone raises the objec- tion that historical sources have no validity where astronomy is concerned, allow me to re- mind them that the history of astronomical discoveries, as already indicated in a previous chapter, rightly commences with such sources. The hypothesis that Saturn was once a sun that shone at night did not originate with me. Others have preceded me\u2014and they stretch all the way back to Sumerian times. Lewis Greenberg and Warner Sizemore were the first to bring the matter to my attention.*? As we have already seen, Morris Jastrow and R. C. Thompson preceded them. But way back of us all there stretches a long line of writers who have left a record of this astronomical belief registered on vellum, papyrus, bark, and clay. Moreover, the combined evidence that led me and my immediate predecessors to this re- discovery was not culled from mythic sources; it was not based on mythic interpretation. Granted that volumes could literally be filled with such complimentary evidence, the fact must be stressed that the original impetus behind this assumption came from what can best be described as ancient astronomical assertions. In his 1910 paper on the subject, Jastrow attempted to rationalize what to him appeared as an impossibility. He could not see what there was in that small pin-point of light we call Sat- urn that could impel the ancients to allude to it as a sun. As indicated in a previous chapter, his rationalization was a lame one. To repeat what I have already stated\u2014because it does bear repetition\u2014anyone could look up and see that Saturn was anything but a sun. Most people, then as now, would not even have been capable of locating Saturn in the night sky. Besides, anyone could see that, Saturn or not, there was no such thing as a night sun. That is unless it either was so or once had been. Even so, it would be amiss for me not to point out that ancient astronomical knowledge can be, as will be, complimented by mythology as long as mythic interpretation retains the ancients\u2019 own original belief. This is something that has not always been adhered to by mod- erm mythologists. Modern mythologists, on the other hand, should not be faulted for their misconceptions for they, too, looked up and the only sun they saw was the one that shines upon us now. Nor is this a uniquely modern misconception. The ancient Greeks, who appeared relatively late on the historical scene, among others, suffered the same confusion. To them, Saturn was the same pin-point of light we see in our own night sky. They could not therefore understand why some of their ancestors called this planet Helios since, to them, Helios was the Sun. As we have seen, the belief that Saturn had once been a sun was so ingrained in the minds of our",

Now it turns out that, among the planets visible to the naked eye, only Jupiter and Saturn have been found to exhibit star-like qualities. These characteristics are not even detectable in the field of a telescope. Without the sophistication of modern space technology, there is no way in which the ancients could have recognized such peculiarities. Yet, from among the en- tire planets visible to them, they picked on one of these two and persistently alluded to it as a sun. The hypothesis presented in this work does not necessarily demand that the age of Earth or the Solar System be reduced. Nor even that of Saturn. Only that its luminous phase could not have terminated billions, but only a few thousand, years ago. As we saw in Chapter 2 of this work, the ancient belief that stones, and even iron, were wont to fall from the sky, despite the fact that meteorites were not allotted the sanctity of sci- entific verity until 1803, turned out to be correct. The ancient belief that the Sun exhibits blemishes on its face, which, up until the seventeenth century of the present era, was still be- ing contested, also proved to be correct. The ancient belief that the Sun, rather than Earth, was at the centre of the Solar System, which truth was not \u201cre-discovered\u201d until the sixteenth century, was proven to be so. The ancient belief that Earth was round, rather than flat, and that it rotated on its axis was found to be true. The ancient belief that comets were physical bodies, and that the appearance of these bodies in our skies followed a predictable periodic- ity, turned out to be accurate. In all these cases, as well as others, ancient belief turned out to be free from error while more modern assumptions turned out to be wrong. Dare we now re- peat history by proclaiming that the ancient belief in a Saturnian sun has to be wrong? Finally, I do not expect astronomers and astrophysicists, or anyone else for that matter, to accept the hypothesis on faith. Fools be they who do. My only plea at this point is for an open mind and a re-evaluation of the facts. Can science be imposed upon to give the matter serious consideration? Besides, is deuterium burning, or nuclear fusion, the only way in which Saturn could have shone as a sun? 164",

True, as stated earlier, there is no way in which Saturn could have shone as bright as the Sun but, for the time being, we will allow the Fiote that much. Even so, the question must be asked: How bright could Saturn have been? Had Saturn, through whatever means, really radiated as a sun, at its present distance it would have been brighter than the full Moon but, in size, it would not have appeared much bigger than it presently does. As a star brighter than the full Moon, we can understand why the Assyro-Babylonians could allude to it as the most prominent among the planets. But why would the Saturnian deity, under whatever name, be allotted a place at the head of every an- cient pantheon above the much brighter, and definitely more prominent, Sun? Why would Saturn have been considered a greater deity than the Sun itself? Because, let us face it, once we appropriate the roles of deities such as Shamash, Atum, Ra, Surya, Helios, Sol, and oth- ers, as applicable to Saturn, there is no deity of any significance left to fit the Sun. Call it a gut feeling for now, but something impels one to believe there was something more to this Saturnian sun besides its brightness that compelled the ancients to revere it, inter alia, as the Lord of the Law of the Universe. JANUS As I have already stated, ancient astronomical knowledge can be complimented by mythology. Much more than that, mythology will end up shouldering the main burden of the scenario we are attempting to reconstruct. Allow me then, at this point, to introduce the Latin god Janus and, through him, a series of interconnected deities. Juvenal and Prokopios referred to Janus as the \u201cmost ancient of the gods\u201d and \u201cthe first of the ancient gods,\u201d while Herodian called him the \u201cmost ancient indigenous god of Italy.\u201d4 This has led mythologists to label Janus as \u201ca uniquely Roman god.\u201d5 Guirand and",

        "main_text": "Pierre tell us that Janus \u201cappears in no other mythology.\u201d\u00ae But in his ancient assimilation to the sky, or heaven, he is, in actuality, only the Latin counterpart of the Greek Ouranos. This is not to say that the Latins borrowed Janus from the Greeks, any more than the Greeks can be said to have derived their Ouranos from the Vedic Varuna who also, among other things, stood for the sky. I use the term \u201csky\u201d here because that is the way mythologists have generally understood the meaning of the god\u2019s assimilation. But, despite Arthur Cook, who identified so many ancient deities as personifications of the sky, it is quite obvious that by \u201csky\u201d something different is indicated. Thus, as reported by Varro, while some authorities did identify Janus as the sky, others were just as confident that the deity personified the uni- verse.\u2019 This \u201cuniverse,\u201d \u201csky,\u201d and/or \u201cheaven,\u201d however, was the kosmos of the Greeks, a term which literally meant \u201corder,\u201d \u201charmony,\u201d or \u201can orderly arrangement.\u201d Thus Janus was considered a \u201cgod of beginnings\u201d\u00ae and ascribed \u201can essential role in the creation of the world,\u201d? which creation is a topic we shall have to reserve for a future work. As Janus Pater, the god was revered as the father of the gods!\u00b0 and god of gods. !! In all the above, Janus bears a close similarity to the Saturnian deities of other nations. Are we then saying that Janus was the same as Saturn? AN OR ANU According to Cook, the \u201cmost probable etymology\u201d of the name Janus is derived from a series of related names. Thus he tell us that: \u201cCorresponding with the series Diviana Diana Iana we have the series Divianus Di- anus lanus (the same as Janus]. Janus, therefore, can be legitimately connected with dius (for diuios), a word familiar to us in the phrase sub dio, \u2018under the open sky\u2019.\u201d!? This derivation has been picked up and repeated by other scholars!3 but, to me, it seems more likely that the name Janus owes its origin to a primitive root which also gave us the Sumero-Babylonian An or Anu, the Greek Ouranos, and the Indic Varuna\u2014all of whom were inter alia assimilated with the mythological sky. This primitive root would then have belonged to a time when, in the words of Max Miiller, \u201cSanskrit was not yet Sanskrit, Greek not yet Greek, but when both, together with Latin, German, and other Aryan dialects, existed as yet as one undivided language...\u201d !4 Like Janus, the Sumerian An was considered the father of all the gods!5 and, like the Sat- urnian deities of other nations, he always stood at the beginning of every theological list from all periods.!\u00a9 To be sure, An and Anu have always been identified as a personification of the",

Rather than being the sky, Anu creates the sky.!9 But is this enough to equate the celestial body that was An as Saturn? We dig further. The god An also appears in Egypt. We find him there as an alias of the god Osiris.\u201d In the \u201cLamentations of Isis and Nephthys,\u201d Isis addresses Osiris as An.2! In a hymn to Osiris he is called the \u201cgod An of millions of years.\u201d22 As we have seen, as the sun of night, Osiris is identifiable as Saturn as so, also, is his assimilation with both Atum and Ra. May we there- fore claim that so must An be understood? OURANOS In Greek mythology, the place of the Latin Janus is taken up by Ouranos, which name the Latins rendered as Uranus. In Greek, ouranos means \u201cheaven\u201d but, as E. Tonnelat indicated, this must not be taken to mean that the god\u2019s original function was the personification of the sky.?3 The association of Ouranos with the sky might have derived from the fact that an ear- lier name for the god seems to have been Epigeios, that is \u201cthe One who is above the earth.\u201d4 Plato himself referred to Ouranos as Kosmos,?5 concerning which see above. It was, however, the Phoenician Sanchoniathon who directly equated Ouranos with Kronos/Saturn.76 So also, more recently, Lynn Rose even though his model is at variance with the one being constructed in this work.?/ VARUNA We find the Indic version of the Greek Ouranos in the person of Varuna. Although the common identity of these two deities has been said to be exaggerated?8 and even doubtful,29 Georges Dum\u00e9zil has gone a long way in establishing the identification.3\u00b0 As Alexander Murray tells us in a more recent work: \u201cThe name is derived from Var, to cover, or to overarch: and so far Varuna means the vault of heaven.

Given the equivocalness of translation, we are not surprised to find Wendy O\u2019Flaherty giving the meaning of the name Varuna as \u201call-enveloping.\u201d32 Even so, and once again, tem- porarily leaving aside the god\u2019s assimilation to the sky, we find that Varuna was sometimes simply called Aditya\u2014\u201ceternal, celestial light\u201d33\u2014-which, like the other deities in the series we have been considering, identifies the deity as a celestial body. Like the Saturnian deities of other nations, Varuna was considered \u201cthe first Sovereign\u201d *4 and \u201cuniversal monarch.\u201d35 While Ovid spoke of \u201cyellow-eyed Saturn,\u201d3\u00b0 Varuna was said to have had yellow eyes.3\u201d True, some may consider the above as rather slim evidence on which to base the identity of Varuna as Saturn but, in following chapters, more will be presented. All that needs to be re-stated here is that, like Janus, with whom we are presently mainly concerned, the above series of gods were all believed to have represented that entity which the Greeks called kosmos and which, among modern mythologists, has come down to symbolize the sky or heaven. Using the old adage that things which are equal to the same thing must be equal to one another, one can therefore assume that, since the deities enumerated above are all, to some extent, identifiable as avatars of the Saturnian deity, then so must Janus be identified. Actually, the above series of identifications has been presented more as an exercise in comparative mythology, and as a basis for coming chapters, than as evidence for the Saturn- ian identity of Janus since the comparisons are not really required to make our case. As will be seen directly below, we have direct evidence at our disposal. SATURNUS That Janus was merely another name for Saturn was known and acknowledged by the ancients themselves. Thus, in describing the New Year Festival, which we have already seen affiliated with the Saturnian planet through the Persian feast of Nauroz, Joannes Lydus had this to say: \u201cOur own Philadelphia still preserves a trace of the ancient belief. On the first day of the month [that is January, named after Janus] there goes in procession no less a per- sonage than Janus himself, dressed up in a two-faced mask, and people call him Sat- urnus, identifying him with Kronos.\u201d38 Here I must at once state that there is no point in claiming that Janus and Saturnus are presented as different deities in the Roman pantheon or that the quote from Lydus is too late, dating from the sixth century, for any credence to be attached to it. In the first place, it was not Lydus who called Janus by the name Saturnus. It was, as he tells us, the people who did so. In other words, he was reporting general belief. More than that, as Lydus himself stated, the knowledge he imparted still preserved \u201ca trace of the ancient belief,\u201d meaning that the",

Meanwhile, the fact that Janus and Saturnus were considered separate deities has nothing to do with the issue. As noted earlier, and as has been recognized by others, there is nothing strange about having different deities, even within the same pantheon, as personifying the same celestial object. As far as Janus is concerned, he could be considered an older Saturn\u2014 Cook had no qualms about making him an older Jupiter,?\u00b0 with which this author naturally disagrees. To be fair, since I mentioned him, Cook did not accept the statement of Lydus\u2014 bur not because he considered the source as a late one. \u201cThe confusion of Ianus [the same as Janus] with Kronos,\u201d he tells us, \u201cno doubt presupposes the usual blunder Kronos = Chronos [that is Time personified], which from the fifth century B.C. onwards queered the course of Greek theology.\u201d4\u00b0 Why did Cook bring this point up? He did so because he could not avoid the veneration of Janus as a god of time, or Time personified,*! which, through the rules of comparative mythology, would equate the Italic deity with the Greek Chronos. But, in the first place, ac- cording to Lydus, his countrymen did not call Janus by the name Kronos. They called him by the name Saturnus. The identification with Kronos was added because Kronos was simply the Greek counterpart of the Italic Saturnus. In the second place, as will be indicated in detail in a later chapter of this work, the blunder concerning the identification of Kronos/Saturn with Chronos/Time happens to be Cook\u2019s. In fact, as we shall soon see, the identification of Janus as Saturn does not rest solely on the statement of Lydus but also on the comparison of this deity\u2019s characteristics with those of the known Saturnian deities of other nations.

But why did I bring all this up at this particular point? Merely to indicate that Janus can also be seen as yet one more example of the Saturnian sun? Hardly. I brought all this up as a foundation for the next datum I wish to present\u2014one that will take us into even deeper wa- ters. STELLA PROXIMA One aspect concerning Janus that has bewildered mythologists in the past was originally presented by the Roman Poet Publius Ovidius Naso, who is bet- ter known simply as Ovid. It was he who reported Janus as having stated: \u201cThe ancients called me chaos, for a being from of old am I.\u201d And, after having described the creation of the \u2018world,\u201d the same Janus is made to dec- are: \u201cT\u2019was then that I, till that time a nere ball, a shapeless lump, assumed he face and members of a god.\u201d47 What this tid-bit of a myth tells us is hat, prior to Creation, Janus/Saturn was relieved to have had the appearance of a phere\u2014\u201ca mere ball.\u201d A similar myth s also told by the Eskimos who claim hat Ataksak, one of their major divini- des, lives in heaven but does not have the form of a man. He merely looks like a sphere.*8 Ataksak is not identified as an aspect of the planet Saturn.

The implication here is clear. If ancient man could remember a time when Saturn appeared as a sphere to the unaided eye, Saturn would had to have been closer to Earth. THE DOGON MYSTERY At this point I wish to introduce a few items which archaeoastronmers have found quite bewildering. I start with the astronomical knowledge of the Dogon of Mali of what had once been the French Sudan, in Africa. Thanks to the writings of Marcel Griaule, Germaine Dieterlen, and Robert Temple, the Dogon, once a little-known tribe with some very curious rituals, have now been placed on the tourist map. But more than their exotic costumes, bizarre masks, dances, and commemorative festivals, these people have become increasingly renowned for their astronomical lore. As Edwin Krupp reported: \u201cCounting the phases of the moon, keeping track of the configurations of Venus, and watching the arrivals and departures of the stars are all part of Dogon practical as- tronomy. The Dogon recognizes 266 stars or asterisms and associate them with 266 pictographic symbols that are painted on rock shelters, altars, and other shrines.\u201d49 The Moon, say the Dogon, \u201cis dry and dead like dry dead blood.\u201d>\u00b0 They know that the planets, which they call tolo tanaze \u2014that is \u201cstars that turn (around something)\u201d>! revolve around the Sun. They claim that \u201cJupiter follows Venus by turning slowly around the sun.\u201d52 They possess four different kinds of calendar\u2014a solar calendar, a lunar calendar, a Venus calendar, and, remarkably, one based on the star known to us as Sirius.\u00b03 Either through in- tuition or otherwise, the Dogon are of the belief that an infinite number of stars and an infi- nite number of planets, together with their satellites, exist. What mostly interests us here, however, has to do with what they have to say in relation to Saturn. Concerning this planet, the Dogon \u201caffirm there is a permanent halo around the star, different from the one sometimes seen around the moon.\u201d55 Their own drawing of Sat- urn actually shows the planet, depicted as a circle, distinctly surrounded by a ring. Saturn is also known to them as \u201cthe star of limiting the place,\u201d* which probably alludes to the fact that Saturn is the outermost planet among those visible to the naked eye. As Krupp was later to admit, these astronomical traditions of the Dogon \u201cwere bound to cause consternation among astronomers, for it seems impossible to reconcile the Dogon as- tronomical knowledge...with their instrumental resources, namely the unaided eye.\u201d57 While Griaule and Dieterlen did not, themselves, come to a definite conclusion concerning how the Dogon came upon their astronomical lore, Robert Temple, who built an edifice on their",

But this is neither here nor there because, to be sure, the Sudan, including Mali, had much earlier come under the influence of Islam, so that no Christian influence could have pene- trated the region\u2014and this despite the fact that the rural areas, such as the one occupied by the Dogon, continued to stick to their traditional animistic ways.\u00ae! And, in any case, would missionaries, Christian or otherwise, bent on converting primitive peoples to their faith, have filled the minds of these natives with astronomical knowledge? Or why was this knowledge, as adhered to by these natives, first reported to the outside world by missionaries who were as confounded by the knowledge as were later astronomers? One other alternative that has been proposed is that the ancestors of the Dogon had been in possession of optical instruments. However, even Galileo, with his pioneering telescope, was not able to see Saturn as a ringed orb. In fact, the image of Saturn that he was capable of resolving through his optical instrument was so vague that he mistook the planet for three separate bodies. As he himself reported: \u201cI have observed with great admiration that Saturn is not a single star but three to- gether, which, as it were, touch each other...the middle being much larger than the lateral ones...by employing a glass which multiplies the superficies [i.e., visible boundaries] more than a thousand times, the three globes will be seen very distinctly and almost touching, with only a small dark space between them.\u201d & It was not until 1655 that Christian Huygens, with a better instrument, was able to report (through his now famous encoded message) that Saturn was actually \u201cgirdled by a thin flat ring, nowhere touching, inclined to the ecliptic.\u201d Is it then probable that the Dogon, who are still living in their primitive mud huts as I write this, could have been in possession of a better telescope than the one utilized by Gali- leo?

There are intimations that, like the Dogon, their ancestors were also aware at first mistook them for two adjoining bodies. that this planet is surrounded by a ring. (illustration by Charles Hogarth.) They definitely hold the belief that Sat- urn is surrounded by satellites. Up until the end of the nineteenth century, Saturn was known to possess only eight satellites. Phoebe, the ninth satellite of Saturn, was discov- ered by W. H. Pickering in 1899. No further Saturnian satellites were discovered until the dawn of the space age. In the views of Earth-based telescopes, only nine of Saturn\u2019s satellites are visible.

But even if there is a grain of truth in these legends, it still would not have enabled the Efe Pygmies, or their ancestors, to see the satellites surrounding the planet Saturn. So where did that information come from? When all is said and done, the only other alternative left to explain the Dogon and Efe Pygmy knowledge of Saturn\u2019s ring structure and its satellites is that their ancestors had, in a far off time, been able to view the planet at closer proximity\u2014which would mean that, somehow, Earth had been much closer to Saturn than it is at present. As outlandish as this idea may appear, there seems to be no other resolution to the problem\u2014which brings to mind the oft-repeated words of Arthur Conan Doyle: \u201cWhen you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, has to be the truth.\u201d7! Besides, as forthcoming chapters will indicate, everything else that our ancient forefathers had to say about this planet continues to strengthen the supposition. THIRD INTERLUDE Science has forgotten Oskar Reichenbach who, as far back as 1884, had proposed a the- ory purporting to prove that land masses on Earth have rifted and moved northward.\u201d His ideas can therefore be said to have preceded the similar ones of Alfred Wegener, himself rel- egated to a footnote in the annals of science as the originator of the Continental Drift Theory, by some 33 years. But, more than that, Reichenbach was of the belief that, in the past, the So- lar System had experienced a series of catastrophic events.\u201d? Basing his conclusions on the imperfect knowledge of his time, he had also formulated certain theories concerning the planet Saturn. As wrong as he might have been, and I am not here concemed with defending Reichenbach, he hit on the novel idea that Earth is \u201can offspring of Saturn,\u201d74 by which he meant to imply that Earth had once been a satellite of the giant gas planet. Whether Immanuel Velikovsky was aware of Reichenbach\u2019s wild theory or not must remain a moot question but, many years later, he, too, came to the same conclusion. Origi- nally, Velikovsky\u2019s Worlds in Collision contained a section on Saturn concerning events that predated the ones he described in that work. For various reasons, he was then advised to ex-",

At one time, because of the manner in which he was treated by academia, Velikovsky threatened to take his Saturnian thesis with him to the grave but, as matters turned out, reason prevailed and he was able to expand and finalize his hypothesis under the title of Saturn and the Flood and Jupiter of the Thunderbolt, a title which was later changed to In the Beginning. As of this writing, this work still has to see the light of day. In 1971, however, Velikovsky gave a lecture at the University of the New World in Valais, Switzerland, in which he presented a synopsis of his unpublished Saturnian scenario. Among the items he disclosed there was the hypothesis that Earth might once have been a satellite of Saturn.7> The lecture was later transcribed by Jan Sammer and appeared as an ar- ticle in KRONOS.7\u00a9 Independent of Velikovsky, but basing their work on his as also on the mytho-historical record, Harold Tresman and Bernard Newgrosh (writing under the name of Brendan O\u2019Gheoghan), also came to the conclusion that Earth must once have orbited Saturn as a satellite,\u201d\u2019 a topic to which Tresman was later to return.78 In analyzing the ambiguous, but tantalizing, planetary system proposed by Philolaos, the Pythagorean philosopher from Southern Italy who lived in the time of Socrates, Lynn Rose came to the same conclusion. Although this system of Philolaos had long been relegated to the library of Classical curiosities, Rose was able to recapture what it might have once in- tended to portray. Although what resulted was a Saturnian scenario the details of which are at variance with the one being presented here, it still contains some of its basic elements. As Rose explained: \u201cAccording to the conventional interpretation, the system of Philolaos had Earth in orbit around a Central Fire...\u201d79 Since the Sun was described as orbiting this Central Fire\u00ae\u00b0 it becomes obvious that the Central Fire could not have been the Sun. An in-depth study of this system, together with his privileged knowledge of Velikovsky\u2019s unpublished work on the subject, enabled Rose to conclude that this Central Fire was Saturn shining as a \u201csun,\u201d and that Earth was in those days in orbit around it.! Combining Velikovsky\u2019s postulate with that of David Talbott and others, Frederick Hall embraced the same idea, presenting it in a speculative scenario concerning the history of the Solar System.\u00ae2 Certain fundamentals, based on specific proposals offered by others, are here accepted, but also tested against the record. The hypothesis that Earth had once been a satellite of Sat- urn, which originally came to this author via Velikovsky, is one of them. Additional research conducted independently by the present author has led to the same conclusion. This research has however made it apparent that prehistoric man, ignorant of astronomical matters, would not have been able to deduce that his world was a satellite of another planet. But, being close enough to Saturn, he would have been able to view that planet as something much bigger than the present pin-point of light we see in the night sky. Saturn, in fact, would have loomed large in the sky as a disk, or sphere, much larger than that of the present full Moon. And this",

But, rather than numbering this as Hypothesis #3, I would like to num- ber it #1, while reshuffling our previous two hypotheses. What we have at this point then is the following: Hypothesis #1: That, from what can be deduced from ancient as well as primitive astron- omical lore, Earth had one been a satellite of the planet Saturn which, because of its proxim- ity, loomed large in the sky as a distinct disc larger than the size of the full Moon. Hypothesis #2: That, according to the ancients, the planet Saturn once shone as a sun. Hypothesis #3: That, still according to the ancients, this primitive Saturnian sun shone during that time we today call the night.

And here another objection may be raised because such shuffling around would be seen by some as violating Bode\u2019s Law, to say nothing of the stability of the Solar System. References concerning the belief in the immutability of the Solar System as a whole, and of its planets in particular, are not required since this one-time verity has been vouched for by many an astronomer and astrophysicist since the dawn of modern astronomical observation. It will be pointed out, for instance, that Simon Laplace (1749-1827) mathematically proved the near-eternal stability of the planets of the Solar System, which work was carried forward and supposedly improved upon by Joseph Lagrange and Sim\u00e9on Poisson. In studying the work of Laplace, however, we find that what he presented was turned into a uniformitarian dogma against his intentions. Regardless of what historians of science have made of his so- called proofs, he himself was not averse to celestial disorder. \u201cThe sky itself, despite the or- derliness of its movements,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis not unalterable.\u201d As far as he was concerned, the stability of the present system is itself \u201cdisturbed by various causes that can be ascertained by careful analysis, but which are impossible to frame within a calculation.\u201d! More than that, he found himself wondering whether the heavenly bodies of the Solar System might be affected by forces other than gravitation, that is whether electric and magnetic energies might also play a role.2 As Peter Warlow described the entire matter: \u201c,..the first thing we must say here is that, contrary to an often-repeated statement, no-one has ever proved that the Solar System has been, or will be, stable for any sig- nificant length of time. The statement has its beginnings about two hundred years ago, and stems from the work of the Marquis de Laplace, who spent much of his life working out a mathematical model for the Solar System. The model was based on the assumption that Newton was right in attributing all of the motions to the effect of gravity alone, and it was limited to a consideration of the major bodies alone\u2014the main planetary bodies plus the Sun. The thirty or so other major bodies [since then many more], in the form of the main satellites of the planets, were ignored.\u201d3 And: \u201cLaplace, himself, fully appreciated the limitations of his model, and he recognized that it was quite possible for the system to become disturbed, either as a result of the",

Indeed, it would probably be appropriate to class him as a catas- trophist, and it is rather ironic that his name has been taken so much in vain by uni- formitarians.\u201d4 This, however, is not the place to review the impetus that Laplace\u2019s mathematics had on those astronomers who came later and the extent to which they saw fit to reinterpret his work in order to force-fit it into their uniformitarian, and even religious, prejudices.> As we will soon see, belief in this matter has changed considerably since the days of Laplace. V. Szebehely and R. McKenzie have even contested G. Hills\u2019 much earlier postulate of a stable Sun-Earth-Moon system,\u00ae and have themselves reached the conclusion that the Moon may someday escape from Earth to become itself a planet.\u201d Thus, if the Moon can yet escape Earth\u2019s attraction to become an independent planet, what is so bizarre about another satellite, in this instance Earth itself, escaping the clutches of Saturn to become the autonomous planet it now is? The Moon, however, is not the only celestial body in our system that has recently been calculated to be capable of an orbital change. Computer simulations by Gerald Sussman have indicated that the orbits of the inner four planets\u2014Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars\u2014are un- stable and liable to future orbital changes.8 Doug Lin had also suggested as far back as 1982 \u201cthat planets like Jupiter could migrate from the outer solar system in toward their parent stars.\u201d? While these are processes which are thought to take millions of years, the important thing to remember, for the time being, is that the new Science of Chaos shows beyond a reas- onable doubt that the Solar System is not the \u201cparagon of predictability that was once imag- ined,\u201d!0 and that Laplace\u2019s deterministic world view no longer holds. What now turns up is that resonance pervades the Solar System and that it probably acts through tidal effects. As further computer retrocalculations conducted by Archie Roy and his team have shown, the orbits of the smaller bodies of the Solar System are actually chaotic and unpredictable. !! And then, in a study of planetary perturbations performed by John Bagby, it was found that such computer simulations as the ones described above are not, of themselves, reliable beyond a certain length of time. As he had it stated: \u201cI found that every outer planet all the way in to at least Mars, was so perturbed by some as yet unmodeled cause that their orbits needed to be computerized every ten years.\u201d !* While Bagby\u2019s simulations had to do with the outer planets, as opposed to the orbits of the inner ones simulated by Sussman, Roy, et al, it should be noted that Mars was included in both studies.",

THE TITIUS-BODE LAW But what, one might ask, of the spacing between the planetary orbits dictated by Bode\u2019s Law? Would this law not be violated had Earth once been a satellite of Saturn? Bode\u2019s Law was actually discovered by Johann Daniel Titius of Wittenberg, Germany, in 1772. But because it was brought to prominence by Johann Elert Bode, another German as- tronomer\u2014some say actually stolen by him!+\u2014it has become known by his name. What is this law? In order of distances, the planets of the Solar System moving outward from the Sun are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. What Titius dis- covered was that if we take the number 3, double it, then double the result, and keep on doubling in that manner, we end up with the series 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, etc. Adding 4 to each of these numbers results in the series 7, 10, 16, 28, 52, 100, etc. If we then divide each of these numbers by 10, we finally end up with -7, 1, 1-6, 2-8, 5-2, 10, and so on. What is ex- traordinary about this final series is that it turns out to be in fair agreement with the actual mean distances of each planet from the Sun, still moving outward, when measured in astron- omical units. !5 Where this law was at first thought to fail was in its fourth placement, since there is no planet to be found at 2-8 astronomical units from the Sun. But then, when the asteroid belt was discovered between Mars and Jupiter close enough to this position, Bode\u2019s Law became engraved in granite\u2014never mind that the law breaks completely down when it comes to Neptune and Pluto. It was then \u201cestablished\u201d that the effects of this law had manifested themselves early in the history of the Solar System. But, in 1960, Robert Bass demonstrated mathematically that planets tend to space themselves in a Bode\u2019s Law type series of orbits, by what he termed the Principle of Least Mean Potential Energy,'\u00a9 even if initially disturbed. Thus the Bode for- mula\u2014for that is all it really is\u2014reveals absolutely nothing about the original spacing of the Solar System planets. This was validated in 1968 by the then Soviet theoretician A. M. Molchanov, who claimed that Bode\u2019s Law is actually the result of orbital resonances and that it could not be of primeval origin.!\u201d This was again stressed seven years later by Michael Ovenden, who renamed Bass\u2019 earlier axiom as the Principle of Least Interaction Action, when he reached a conclusion identical to Molchanov\u2019s\u2014\u201cthat the present distribution of the planetary and satellite orbits is the result of mutual perturbations.\u201d!8 What Ovenden deter-",

Hills computed simulations of the N-body problem and discovered that \u201carbitrary planetary configurations, started with purely random initial positions and veloci- ties, tend, during a few thousand to a few hundred thousand subsequent years, to \u2018relax\u2019 into a Bode\u2019s-law type of resonant configuration.\u201d2\u00b0 So much, then, for \u201cmillions of years.\u201d Now it is true that the planetary system that relaxed the fastest in Hills\u2019 simulations, at something like 2000 years, consisted of the Sun with four planets, each of which contained ten times the mass of the Jovian planets\u2014hardly a portrait of our Solar System. However, the actual planetary composition of this simulation is not the central issue being discussed here. What is important to keep in mind is that Hills showed that, under certain conditions, planets can relax into a Bode\u2019s Law type of configuration within a comparatively short time. And this is important because, up to then, this had generally been thought to be impossible\u2014which, if nothing else, proves that what is thought to be impossible in astronomy today may be thought of as being quite possible tomorrow. Actually, as Bass informed his readers in 1974,?! the phenomenon discovered by Hills was foreseen by Emest Brown as early as 1931 2? but no one seems to have paid him any heed. What all this implies is that Bode\u2019s Law is an empiricism based on the present spacing of the planets. Lynn Rose explained it best: \u201cTt is usually not the case that mathematical gimmickry comes first, and that an inven- tory of the heavens is taken later. Usually the heavenly body count comes first, and the tissue of mathematical rationalization is developed later. Thus Kepler first consid- ered that there were six bodies orbiting the Sun\u2014Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn [since the rest had not yet been discovered]\u2014and then invented his scheme involving the five regular solids to explain why there could be only those six bodies. And in the eighteenth century, when Titius was working on his law and Bode was stealing it, the properties of the known bodies were examined first, and then the artificial mathematical formula\u2014now known as \u2018 Bode\u2019s Law\u2019 \u2014was devel- oped in an effort to rationalize what was already known.\u201d3 In fact, one of the most reputable encyclopedias of astronomy has it stated that \u201cthe Titius-Bode Law...is most probably a mere coincidence.\u201d*4 Be that as it may, when it comes to the actual Solar System, Hills\u2019 above-described model suggested to him that a reasonable estimate for the relaxation of the Jovian planets into their present orbits would be between 100,000 and a million years. Thus, while it may be pointed out that Bass himself was more concerned with the orbital crossings of an erratic Venus as proposed by Immanuel Velikovsky, which does not concern us here, than he was with the Jovian giants, Hills\u2019 conclusion may be said to bode disaster for the Saturnian scen- ario being proposed here. After all, a hundred thousand to a million years would hardly place our posited event within human memory.",

        "main_text": "What must not be lost track of, however, is that these computer simulations, as well as Ovenden\u2019s calculations, involve point-particle (or point-mass) motions and not those of semi- rigid solid bodies. This, also, is important because, according to point-particle Newtonian mechanics, the relaxation of planets into resonant orbits would be reversible. It was for this reason that, despite Ovenden\u2019s own disclaimer,25 Bass suggested the inclusion of tidal fric- tion as this would be one way of breaking this reversing tendency. Hills, as later Ovenden, saw no reason to take this drag into consideration. Had they done so, their results would have been entirely different. As Bass indicated, the addition of tidal friction \u201ccould put the planets on to vastly different orbits.\u201d27 Personally, I will not claim that tidal friction, or tidal friction alone, would resolve the Saturnian problem. In the meantime, however, it should be kept in mind that Bass was not re- lying on Hills\u2019 discovery as much as he was on an adaptation of it. Eventually, Ovenden\u2019s Principle of Least Interaction Action failed in predicting the pres- ent orbits of the Jovian planets. Ovenden could only save his Principle by postulating the one-time existence of an additional massive object and then getting rid of it at some point in time. According to this postulate\u2014which, at first glance, should seem wilder than the one being proposed in this work\u2014the Solar System has still not reached equilibrium? (which reminds us very much of Bagby\u2019s postulate concerning his undiscovered planet as the cause for planetary perturbations). Ovenden placed the catastrophe which got rid of his one-time planet at 16 million (1.6 X 107) years ago, while also stating that it would take something like another 280 million (2.8 X 108) years for the Solar System to reach complete equilibrium (thus allowing his Principle of Least Interaction Action to fulfill itself). Since, however, I am here only concerned with the past and present orbits of the planets, Ovenden\u2019s 280 million years of future orbital re-adjustments are irrelevant to our case. But we will take note that, ac- cording to Ovenden, the present near-equilibrium of the Solar System is not its final stage\u2014that, in fact, the Solar System is still adjusting to a relatively recent planetary shuffle. Needless to say, it will again be pointed out that an event which supposedly occurred 16 million years ago is hardly \u201crecent.\u201d But let us not get carried away just yet because one thing that Ovenden himself stressed takes the wind out of the above objection. \u201c...if it can be shown that processes operate within the solar system that can rearrange the planetary orbits on a sufficiently short time-scale then we must conclude that the present distribution of planetary and satellite orbits contain no information about conditions at the time of formation of the solar system.\u201d29 This was expanded on later by Archie Roy when he wrote: \u201cWe have seen that the work of J. G. Hills and M. W. Ovenden demonstrated that af- ter a short period of wild behaviour, a planetary system could settle down into a dis- tribution of orbits very similar to a commensurable Bode-type configuration. Such a configuration would, under the action of other forces such as tidal friction, nudge the system into a neighbouring truly stable configuration, which on inspection might be",

Indeed numerical inte- grations backward in time could take the system, still well behaved, through the episode of wild behaviour as if it had never been.\u201d3\u00b0 Ovenden himself went even further when he theorized that the close approach of planets to each other is not only possible but possibly inherent in the very nature of the cosmos.?! From this he also reached the conclusion that \u201ca system of planets (or satellites) will change its configuration slowly when the planets are far apart\u201d but \u201cquickly when they are close to- gether and interacting violently.\u201d32 This brings us to W. M. Smart who, in 1953, had already understood that such \u201cperturbation series\u201d could not be relied upon except for a very short time\u2014one or two centuries\u201d to be exact.33 Later, Bass demonstrated that: \u201c,..it is perfectly possible, according to Newton\u2019s Laws of Dynamics and Gravitation when three or more bodies are involved, for planets to nearly collide and then relax into an apparently stable Bode\u2019 Law type of configuration within a relatively short time...\u201d34 Moreover, by \u201ca relatively short time,\u201d Bass meant \u201cin a few centuries.\u201d35 If it can therefore be shown that the planets approached and interacted with each other during the age of man, the resonances inherent in Bode\u2019s Law will not admit to dating in millions of years. And, on this issue, the historical record seems to be clear enough even if still unrecognized by most conventionalists. RETROACTIVE CALCULATIONS What then of retroactive calculations (or retrocalculations, for short)? Retrocalculation \u201cis the method which relies on the assumption that the Earth has been behaving in a nice sedate uniformitarian manner, and it is assumed that it is possible to calculate backwards in time to establish the exact date of astronomical events.\u201d3\u00a2 Do not such calculations prove that no change in the orbits or placements of the planets have taken place in the past? No, they do not. As Leroy Ellenberger indicated when he was still a Velikovskian catastrophist: \u201cNo retro-calculations to date have been inherently capable of duplicating near-collisions [among the planets] even if one occurred.\u201d37 William Mullen, too, observed that such retrocalcul- ations are futile since they involve \u201ca problem rather like taking the position of a few billiard- balls towards the end of the game and calculating the positions of the complete set back to the beginning.\u201d38 Or, as Warlow pointed out: \u201cIn fact, as far as the stability of the system is concemed, there are experts in the field today who admit that, if we take the system in its present state, it is only reasonable to calculate forward or backward in time for about three",

However,\u201d he continues, \u201cthey would admit that there is much we do not under- stand.\u201d40 The astronomers Victor Clube and Bill Napier are of the same mind: \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d they wrote, \u201cit is not generally possible to calculate past and future orbits in great detail, small uncertainties magnifying rapidly. Most calculations in- volving three or more solar system bodies are unreliable beyond a few hundred years.\u201d41 Or, as Jill Abery succinctly phrased it: \u201cForget all those old computer calculations of past and future behaviour of the Solar System. Mathematicians now realise that the system is too complicated for conven- tional computers to ever come up with the right answer. However, they have a new mathematical system which ignores the laws of motion in our familiar 3-dimensional space. Interestingly it demonstrates that the Solar System\u2019s behaviour is very chaotic with many possible scenarios.\u201d42 Let us not forget the words of astronomer Archie Roy, reviewed above, to the effect that \u201cnumerical integrations backward in time could take the system, still well behaved, through the episode of wild behaviour as if it had never been.\u201d In the end, nobody put it better than Lynn Rose and Raymond Vaughan. \u201cRetrocalcula- tion is a very iffy business at best,\u201d they wrote. \u201cSuppose that a spacecraft was launched into orbit this morning. Retrocalculation would show where that spacecraft was located on its or- bit at this same time yesterday, when it was still on its launching pad!\u201d43 FORMER ORBITS As Wallace Thornhill wrote in 1997, \u201cit is well known among astronomers that Newton\u2019s law of gravity when applied to more than 2 orbiting bodies results in chaotic motion after a relatively short time.\u201d4+ But, more important than that, he also asked: \u201cHow can the solar system have remained in its apparently stable configuration for the 5 aeons required by current theories of solar system evolution? And why, if the planets and moons were formed from the same primordial cloud of gas and dust, are they such a fruit salad of physical characteristics, axial tilts, rotation rates and or- bits?\u201d45",

I can say this with confidence because they themselves have not been exactly averse to postulating scenarios in which orbital paths are shown to be capable of change. Among them, Thomas Van Flandern came close to an unheard-of sensationalism when he wrote: \u201cWe are only now beginning to see the Universe as a place of constant change with a rich and varied history and as the site of a great many unique events that continue to this day. Mercury, for example, may once have been a satellite of Venus that, in the not-so-distant past, escaped. Whether or not this happened, it is clear that some event caused Venus to spin in a different direction and at a slower speed...than any other planet. Both satellites of Mars and most of Jupiter\u2019s did not originate with those planets but also seem to have been captured relatively recently... \u201cSaturn\u2019s rings could be yet another example of the solar system\u2019s dynamism.

The \u2018Mercury as Venus\u2019s Moon\u2019 theory explains at one stroke many observations, such as the reduced/reversed spin of Venus, its massive atmosphere, the 2/3 spin resonance of Mercury, the oblate shape of Mercury, and many more.\u201d48 George Wetherhill posited an even wilder scenario for Mercury in which the planet had originally orbited the Sun at Earth\u2019s present distance. Then, according to this particular the- ory, Mercury was involved in a violent collision in which the planet was melted. A second collision then resulted in the stripping away of Mercury\u2019s crust and its ejection out of its or- bit. Deflected from its path by Earth\u2019s gravity field, together with that of Venus, Mercury eventually settled down into its present circular track.4 Alan Stern, on the other hand, came out with a proposition of satellite capture, rather than escape. Not that the capture of satellites by planets had not been propounded before. But this one deals with the planet Neptune and its companion, Triton, a moon the size of the planet Pluto. Triton, it was found out, orbits Neptune in what astronomers call \u201cthe wrong direc- tion,\u201d that is clockwise as seen from \u201cabove,\u201d when all other satellites revolve counterclock- wise. The most likely explanation for this, according to Stern, is that Triton had once orbited freely but, passing too close to Neptune, was captured by the larger planet as its moon. So, similarly, with the planet Pluto which, until 1978, was still believed to be without a moon. But a later ground-based photograph of Pluto revealed the presence of a satellite\u2014since then named Charon\u2014 orbiting the planet. Because Charon is larger than our Moon, and one third as large as Pluto itself, Stern has said that it is \u201creally more accurate to call this a double planet.\u201d>! Stern is thus of the opinion that these two planets had also once orbited freely but that, coming too close, they managed to capture each other.52 But what of Earth itself? Has anyone before us ever posited that it, too, may have shifted? THE SHIFTING EARTH As Tom Yulsman reported: \u201cWe like to think that the Earth\u2019s orbit and the shape of its magnetic field are changeless\u2014that as the years pass, the planet follows a rock-steady route about the Sun while the compass points resolutely north.

Both orbit and magnetic field indeed change...\u201d53 We will not concern ourselves here with the change in Earth\u2019s magnetic field, nor will we concern ourselves much with what led to this \u201cdiscovery\u201d beyond the shortest of synopses. What is at the bottom of it is the conclusion reached by the geologist Madeline Briskin in her investigation of seafloor core samples. Sediment has always been deemed a reliable indicator of past climatic conditions. What Briskin discovered through the age and molecular design of the ocean fossils imbedded in the sediments she studied, led her to conclude that Earth\u2019s cli- mate follows a repetitive cycle of changes of approximately 413,000 years duration. This cycle, according to her, is brought about by Earth\u2019s changing orbit as it moves closer to, then farther away from, the Sun. As far as the present work is concerned, no judgment will be passed on the possible validity or otherwise of this deduction. We merely note it as one indi- cation of various theories from the establishment in which changes in Earth\u2019s orbit are de- duced from certain evidences and made to account for certain past situations. Are any of these scenarios any wilder than one which posits Earth to be an escaped satel- lite of Saturn? Ah yes\u2014but the above events, whether they ever transpired or not, have all been dated to millions of years ago as opposed to the scenario being presented here which claims Earth to have still been a satellite of Saturn during the advent of man. This is an ob- jection we will be running into time and again. In 1986, Lynn Rose, who, with Raymond Vaughan, had been working on the Babylonian Ninsianna tablets, surprised Velikovsky\u2019s followers by correcting their earlier conclusion, and that of Velikovsky himself, concerning the not-so-ancient orbit of the planet Venus. In 1950, Velikovsky had been of the opinion that the astronomical observations contained in these tablets\u2014sometimes referred to as the Tablets of Ammizadugqa, sometimes simply as the Venus tablets\u2014showed beyond a reasonable doubt that Venus had been moving on an en- tirely different orbit at the time the observations were conducted.\u00b0> Originally concurring with him, Rose and Vaughan eventually came to an entirely different conclusion. \u201cLike many others, including Velikovsky, we at one time took it for granted that the Venus tablets would tell us about a radically different orbit of Venus...We have grad- ually come to realize, however, that at the time of the observations Venus might have been on or close to its present orbit...The strangeness of these eighth-century [B.C.] observations of Venus seems to be mainly due to their having been made from an Earth that was on a radically different orbit from the present orbit of Earth.\u201d5 In 1993, Michael Reade came to similar conclusions,*\u2019 although the amount in Earth\u2019s orbital expansion as given by him\u2014from a posited 0.9904 AU to the present 1.000 AU\u2014would not lend itself to being called radical, representing a mere 0.97% to 1% expansion. \u00b08",

And that would be at Earth\u2019s present distance from the Sun. What, then, would Earth\u2019s temperature have been at Saturn\u2019s present distance from the Sun\u2014insulating atmosphere or not? This is most impor- tant because, needless to say, Earth\u2019s temperature has a direct bearing on the sustenance of life. The existence of life on Earth, it has often been stated, is manifestly due to our planet\u2019s distance from the Sun\u2014it just happens to be positioned in the Sun\u2019s habitable zone\u2014which is the reason why it is the only planet in the Solar System capable of bearing life. Earth, it should be remembered, is at 1 AU from the Sun (approximately 93 million miles). Saturn is at 9.5 AU from the Sun (approximately 886.3 million miles). As a satellite of Saturn, would not Earth have been in the \u201cfreeze zone\u201d? How, then, could it have sus- tained life, including that of man? What, exactly, is the extent of the Sun\u2019s habitable zone? At one time the habitable zone was believed to stretch between 0.7 and 1.3 AU. In 1977, however, Michael Hart reduced this zone to the narrow range extending from 0.95 to 1.01 AU.\u00ae This would still have meant that had Earth been 5% closer to the Sun, its oceans would evaporate; had it been only 1% further away, total glaciation would put an end to life. But then, in 1988, the scientists at NASA\u2019s Ames centre found reason to increase the distance of the habitable zone by 50%. Life, however, requires more than the right amount of heat and sun-light. It also requires water, of which Earth has an abundance. But now here\u2019s the rub. Long-range exploration of the planets has convinced astronomers that Venus and Mars also once possessed abundant water. In the case of Venus, its water is said to have evaporated into space because of its closer proximity to the Sun.\u00ae! This mechanism, however, does not work for Mars which is farther out from the Sun than is Earth. An entirely different process had therefore to be worked out for the red planet. As James Kasting wrote: \u201cMars is freeze-dried today, not be- cause it is too far from the sun but because it is a small planet and therefore cooled off com- paratively quickly.\u201d62 All this has led to the belief that the habitable zone, which has now been revised to range \u201cfrom just inside the orbit of Earth to beyond the orbit of Mars,\u201d has \u201cmigrated slowly out- ward from its position when the planets first formed...about 4.6 billion years ago, because the sun has gradually brightened over time.\u201d What this additionally entails is that in an- other billion years, as the Sun continues to brighten and becomes ever hotter, Earth\u2019s orbit",

But, the reader may complain, is it at all possible to shift this habitable zone all the way out to Saturn? Maybe not, but, theoretically at least, could we not perhaps shift Saturn into the habitable zone? Actually, back in 1982, Ragnar Forshufvud theorized just that, moving a Saturn that had once been much larger to \u201cmuch closer to the Sun\u201d.\u00ae But I only present this datum as an interesting exercise because, judging by what can be deduced from the mytho- historical record, the truth may have been exactly the opposite. Be that as it may, it is not really necessary to move a celestial body into the so-called habitable zone, or even closer to the Sun, in order to have it appropriately heated. Io, one of Jupiter\u2019s satellites, is said to be heated through Jupiter\u2019s tidal pull. Then why not Earth as a satellite of Saturn? And even then, do we really need Saturn\u2019s tidal pull in order to heat Earth? Have we not already seen that Saturn radiates more heat than it actually receives from the Sun? Can not this excessive heat be seen as the residue from a time when Saturn was much hotter? Have we not, on the strength of the mytho-historical record, posited that Saturn had once been a miniature sun radiating its own heat and light? True enough, Saturn could never have been as hot as the Sun. The proximity of Earth to Saturn, however, would have more than compensated for this.",

What Wescott referred to as Aster is to us the planet Saturn. If this had really been the case\u2014in other words, had Saturn been the only celestial body visible from Earth during the indeterminate time with which we are concerned\u2014it would add even more to the ancient belief that Saturn had been the most prominent heavenly body that could be seen in Earth\u2019s primordial sky. Think about it: We have seen that Earth had been a satellite of what is now the planet Saturn, which planet was described as having been near enough to Earth to be remembered as a sphere, which sphere, in turn, was described as a sun that shone at night during a time when no other heavenly body could be seen. What could have been more prominent? But does the mytho-historical record uphold the view that Saturn was the only visible body during the time in question? David Talbott has long focused attention on this topic. As he had it stated: \u201cThe Egyptians remembered the creator as the solitary Atum or Ra, whom we recog- nize as the planet Saturn. In the accounts of all periods, Ra is originally a solitary god. The ancient sun is he...who had no companions.\u201d* \u201cI am Atum, when I was alone in Nun,\u201d the god is made to state.* The deity is thus called \u201cthe God One,\u201d the \u201cOnly God\u201d \u2014\u201cexcept whom at the beginning none other existed.\u201d* Time and again, in Egyptian liturgies, we hear of Atum being made to state \u201cwhen I was alone.\u2019\u201d Time and again, Atum is lauded as he who \u201cwas alone.\u201d\u2019 Thus the god, \u201cin his earliest remembered state,\u201d as Talbott has noted, is inactive and motionless\u2014 \u201cdoing nothing, lacking",

No other deity existed with him or before him. PRAJAPATI We have already seen the Indic Brahma, known as the \u201cfather of gods and men,\u201d identi- fied as Saturn through the name Brahmanyah. In that respect, it is noteworthy that Brahma is considered to have been the first of the Devas, which term is understood as meaning \u201cdeities,\u201d but which, in effect, means the \u201cshining ones,\u201d\u201d an apt term for heavenly bodies. It is therefore telling that Brahma, too, was described as having originally been alone: \u201cHe hov- ers, alone, above everything.\u201d\u2122 An epithet, usually translated to mean \u201cLord of Creatures,\u201d\u201d by which Brahma was known is Prajapati.\u201d This is so true that, in the Vishnu Purana, Prajapati is given as an addi- tional name for Brahma.\u201d Like others of the Saturnian deities we have been examining, Prajapati was also referred to as \u201cthe One God.\u201d\u201d Prajapati\u2019s identity as Saturn does not solely rely on that of Brahma. As the 11th century A.D. Arabian scholar, Al-Biruni, discovered during his travels in India, the Lord of Saturn is called Prajapati\u2014pure and simple.* It should therefore not surprise us that, in distinction to Brahma, who was actually his own self, Prajapati was believed to have originally ruled alone.

Among the American Indians of the north-west, the creator was known as Raven. But here we have to differentiate between two Ravens. Most tales concerning Raven present this mysterious being as a shape-shifter and trickster who was often meddling with what had been created, even though he himself was also responsible for creating certain elements. As a meddler, shape-shifter, and trickster, Raven is identifiable as a personification of the planet",

Some have claimed that man\u2019s own ancestors, long dead, perhaps through the medium of dreams, were also vivified into ghosts, or lost souls, which were eventually incorporated into an ever evolving religious belief. Others insist that the ancient deities evolved out of a respect for certain historical persons of note\u2014an old idea which has recently been gloriously revived by David Rohl in his sensational attempt to rewrite ancient history. Those who hold to this view usually point with pride to the Mesopotamian Gilgamesh, a supposed king of Uruk, and the Egyptian Imhotep, architect to King Djoser, as prime examples of their evidence. But that Gilgamesh was anything but a historical person has finally been established beyond a reason- able doubt, once and for all, by Ev Cochrane,\u201d while the case of Imhotep is somewhat unique. The first builder of a pyramid\u2014a stepped one to be sure\u2014later dynasts were so im- pressed by Imhotep\u2019s accomplishments that he was elevated to the stature of a god. This is not to be wondered at because, after all, the Egyptian pharaohs themselves were all looked upon as living gods. We do not, however, encounter Imhotep in any mythological themes, let alone any of a cosmogonic nature. For whatever it is worth, and Rohl notwithstanding, the belief that the ancient gods were really deified historical persons, never adhered to by many, is now accepted by even less. On the contrary, the reverse is true, in that some of the primeval deities were eventually demythologized and presented in human garb even by the ancients themselves.\u201d Our own hypothesis, as presented in this work, holds to the view that the concept of deity owes its origin to the planets, especially the planet Saturn, and not to such invented spirits, ghosts, demons, or historical persons as described above. I am not here asserting that the mysteries of everyday life, as they pertained to our primitive forebears, were not conducive of the myth-making process. But to say that our ancestors were more concerned with the threatening character of everyday life, such as flood, famine, earthquakes, and the like, is to go against what they themselves told us concerning their beliefs. If the truth need be known, even such calamities as enumerated above were often connected with the planetary deities, and they were so connected by the ancients themselves. Thus, to give but a few examples: Among the Incas, Saturn was considered the god of famine.\u00ae* Almost throughout the entire world, Mars was considered the god of pestilence.\u201d Venus was associated with fear, dark- ness and death.\u201d The Babylonians, moreover, never discarded their belief that even earth- quakes were actually caused by the planets.* Adherents of the animistic theory, however, base their concepts of the origin of religion on the beliefs of present primitive peoples, rather than the civilized nations of the ancient world. But even there, their theory meets with various objections. Consider, for instance, the Efe pygmies of the Ituri forest whom we had occasion to mention in a previous chapter.

Thus de Santillana and von Dechend were not entirely correct when they stated that \u201call the stories, characters and adventures narrated by mythology concentrate on the active pow- ers among the stars, who are the planets.\u201d\u201d Regardless of the impetus behind its origin, a fair share of primitive mythology does concern itself with non-planetary spirits of nature. We notice, however, that these spirits of nature, a few among which have been mentioned above, were not deified\u2014that is they were not regarded as demiurges with powers over the destiny of man. Only among the more sophisticated Incas, long out of primitiveness, was Thunder, for instance, considered something of a deity, and even then he was subservient to the Creator.\u201d And there, I must stress, lies the difference, because, according to his own Statements, ancient man was not concerned with the purported antics of fog, fair weather, or other nature spirits, demons, and fairies. What concerns us in this study are the great deities of mankind\u2014the creators and destroyers, the movers of the world\u2014which we find imbuing the religions and cosmic beliefs of early civilizations and primitive tribes alike. Again, I am not attempting to negate the fact that so-called primitive cultures perceive the world as being spirit animated. But what of it? Until a few hundred years ago, were not the most sophisticated centers of European civilization also imbued with superstition, which is what a spirit-animated belief amounts to? Are countries like China and India, Indonesia, and heaven knows where else, not superstition-ridden to this day? Do they not still throw live chickens into volcanic craters in Java,\u201d and pour gin, in lieu of awa, to Pele in America\u2019s fiftieth state, as endeavors meant to pacify the destructive force exhibited by volcanoes?\u201d Does any of this negate the fact that the countries in question also pay homage to a higher deity dictated by whatever religion these societies adhere to? Why, then, could not primitive planetary worship have co-existed with a more down-to-earth animism? As research implies, residual planetary worship continues to saturate the most primitive beliefs up to the present, as exemplified by the religion of the Efe pygmies mentioned above. Nor must this particular example be viewed as unique. Space does not here permit anything close to a fair sampling of such cases but I could easily have included a catalogue of similar residues found embedded in the beliefs of such people as the Dogon of the Sudan, which is present-day Mali, the astronomical lore of whom we have already discussed in a previous chapter; the Negroes of Mozambique; the Bambala of the Congo; the Bushongo; and many other tribes from the African heartland. The mythology of Oceania is likewise saturated with residual planetary worship as is that of the Inuit from Alaska to Greenland. None of these primitive societies, and others like them, can be said to be astronomically adept, yet, when traced to their basic fundamentals, the roots of their religious beliefs exhibit an uncanny simi- larity to the planetary motifs found scattered among the more sophisticated early civilizations of man. True, demons and nature spirits also abound, but none of these play a cosmogonic role or hold a prominent place in the complex religious rituals performed by these societies. Students of religion will tell us that logic dictates that man would have first endowed what he could see around him with spiritual life before he would have done likewise with the far away planets.

Could he then have believed that rivers and trees and wind and thunder were animated by spirits before he believed similarly of the most com- forting object he was aware of \u2014the Sun? Given that the Sun and the Moon are much more conspicuous than the planets, theirs should have been the major role in primitive mythology. How is it then that, while not always readily obvious from cursory studies, the prime protagonists were invariably the planets and planet-induced phenomena? This poses something of a conundrum to those who view mythology through uniformitar- ian eyes, one that has already been commented on by Immanuel Velikovsky\u2122 and David Talbott.\u201d The riddle, however, is solved when we discover, as in fact the sources themselves convincingly illustrate, that the planets, or at least some of them, prime among them the planet Saturn, were once more conspicuous than Sun and Moon. Once this is accepted, as it is by an ever-growing body of neo-catastrophists, it becomes much easier to accept that before man had developed an awareness of the heavenly bodies, he had no gods at all. This would seem to lead to the assumption that early man lived for long ages before he discovered his first god but the fruits of research indicate otherwise. In the first place, one must stop thinking of the planets in this instance as mere pin-points of light in the night sky. It should by now have become obvious to the readers of this work that man\u2019s earliest mem- ory of the planets is one that hints at recognizable orbs hanging low in the sky. As we have thus far seen, originally there seems to have been only one such orb visible in the sky\u2014the planet Saturn. Mankind, it now seems, discovered its identity under the close influence of this planetary body which is why the Saturnian deity, in his many guises, is to be found at the head of every major pantheon throughout the ancient civilized world. This primeval Saturn entered man\u2019s memory first as a passive entity which was originally looked upon with neither fear nor awe. But, as I intend to show in a future work, this was not to remain so. In time, a series of events transpired which so impressed the human mind that Saturn became, for man, the very centre of his environment, his ever-increasing awe and, eventually, the deduced reason for his very being. Given all this, while not wishing to borrow credence, what would be so difficult in accepting that (a) man\u2019s original deity was a plane- tary body and that (b) prime among these deified bodies was the planet Saturn? The question, of course, is simply this: Is there any proof that any of this transpired? So let me be quite honest. If proof is what we are after, it is not forthcoming\u2014any more than proof to the contrary is. But the evidence now at hand, which we shall continue to present, is more than enough to upset antiquated views of man\u2019s emergence as a religious being and quite capable of upholding this new, if revolutionary, theory.

As we also noted in that same chapter, the word Shabbath is sometimes said to derive from the closely related shabath, which means \u201cto repose\u201d or \u201cto rest.\u201d2 This meaning, in tum, has been said to have arisen because Elohim rested from his work of Creation on that day.3 What is indicated by this is that Elohim\u2019s rest came first, for which the Sabbath was then named. It seems, however, that there is more to this \u201cresting\u201d business than meets the eye. Or why would the planet in question have been named for that particular day, thus also receiving the meaning of \u201crest\u201d? The connection of Saturn with the Creation is not restricted to Hebrew tradition. In Chapter 4, we also had occasion to mention a similar tradition as believed in by the Persians. We repeat that tradition here as recorded by Al-Biruni: \u201cOn the 6th day of Farwardin, the day Khurdadh, is the great Nauroz, for the Persians a feast of great importance. On this day\u2014they say\u2014God finished the creation, for it is the last of the six days...On this day God created Saturn...\u201d4 What did the planet Saturn have to do with Creation or the resting of Elohim? Why was Saturn known as the Lord of the Sabbath?5 One of the strange things about the Sabbath is that it is the only day to which the Israel- ites gave a name. The rest of the days of the week were called by their ordinal numbers.\u00a2 Why this exception? Why was Saturn of importance even to the ancient Hebrews? Not that, in later times, they were overly proud of this. In fact, as William Heidel informs us, they re- sented the identification of the Sabbath with Saturn\u2019s day for long afterwards.\u201d That Shabtai, sometimes referred to as Kokab Sabet, also called the Sabbath Star,? meant \u201cthe resting Star or Planet\u201d is well known.!\u00b0 In his attempt to connect the order of Creation, day by day, as described in the Book of Genesis, with the different planetary deities honored traditionally on the successive days of the seven-day week, Robert Graves, as usual,",

The only points of validity that he mentioned is the well known association of the Jewish Sabbath with Saturn and the fact that this planetary deity had long been known as the god of repose, that is of rest.!2 But, if we discount the derivation of the name Shabtai from the business of Elohim\u2019s rest after Creation, what can we offer by way of an explanation for this unusual characteristic? Or, why was the planet Saturn called the Resting Star or Planet? THE GOD OF THE JEWS The Israelite connection with the planet Saturn goes beyond the naming of the Sabbath after this planetary deity. Thus, for instance, when the prophet Amos was riling against the Israelites, he accused them of having carried images of a stellar deity in a tabernacle. The King James version of the passage in question is made to read: \u201cHave ye offered...sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.\u201d 3 This memory was still vivid in the days of the New Testament and is repeated in the Acts of the Apostles where the figure of Chiun is replaced with that of Remphan: \u201c.,.O ye house of Israel, have ye offered...slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness? Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them...\u201d !4 This is in keeping with the Septuagint version of the same passage which reads: \u201cHave ye offered...victims and sacrifices, O house of Israel, forty years in the wilder- ness? Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Rephan, the images of them which ye made for yourselves.\u201d The forty years in the wilderness alluded to in the above verses refer to the wandering of the Israelites following their departure, or exodus, from Egypt under Moses. Concerning the deity called Moloch we will offer nothing here, reserving the topic for a future work. Here I wish to concentrate on the god called Chiun in one version and Remphan/Rzphan in the oth- ers. Who was this deity? In both Amos and Acts this god is alluded to as \u201cthe star of your god\u201d \u2014that is the star of the Israelites\u2019 god. But what star did Remphan personify? In the Testament of Solomon, Remphan is rendered Raphan concerning whom Solomon was said to have built a temple in conjunction with one to Baal/Moloch.!5 The Testament of Solomon is of Jewish origin but, as Louis Ginzberg informs us, as we now have it, it is laden \u201cwith many Christian layers.\u201d!6 This is noted here because the name Raphan (or Ramphan or Rephan) is unknown in Hebrew and must therefore have been introduced, or transliterated, by one of the Christian editors. Ginzberg was of the opinion that Raphan (or Rephaim) is a",

One question that comes to mind at this point is: What were the Israelites doing running about the desert with the image of the Saturnian star in their tabernacle? Let us be honest: Present Jewish and Christian sentiments notwithstanding, it has long been known that Saturn was the god of the Jews. In more recent years, for instance, Carl Jung knew very well that Saturn was the star of Israel.22 Much earlier, Aurelius Augustinus was more explicit when he informed his readers that the ancients considered the planet Saturn as the god of the Jews. Throughout the Middle Ages, the Jews were largely known as the People of Saturn\u201d (as so, incidentally, were the Scythians?5). This belief, however, is much older than that since even the Roman historian Tacitus (c. A.D. 55-117) described the Jews as worshipping the planet Saturn as their god.26 Whether the tabernacle in question was the acclaimed one that Moses was said to have had constructed, and in which the famed ark of the covenant was housed, remains a moot question. This much, however, should be stated: While the tabernacle which Moses had had built is usually referred to as the Mishkan and/or the Ohel, the tabernacle mentioned in the Hebrew version of Amos is simply called sukot, the plural of suka, meaning \u201ctents.\u201d THE TROUBLE WITH AMOS Scholars of the Jewish faith have, naturally enough, found much to criticize in the above interpretation of the Amosian verse in question.\u2019 As it has been said, this \u201cis a difficult verse and the subject of very diverse interpretation\u201d ?\u00ae \u2014or, as M. Weinfeld put it, a verse on which many a pen has been broken,\u201d (although, in my opinion, his has fared no better). This diffi- culty is not abated by the fact that the Hebrew \u2014that is Masoretic\u2014version of the passage in question replaces Moloch with Siccuth (or Sikut, Sikkut) while placing the event as coming in the future rather than having occurred in the past. Thus: \u201cSo shall you take up Siccuth your king and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.\u201d",

        "main_text": "One of the things that has happened here is quite obvious. The reading \u201cthe suka of your Moloch\u201d is rendered as \u201cSiccuth your melek\u201d \u2014that is, \u201cSiccuth your king.\u201d This, in turn, was based on the assumption that Siccuth is the same name of the Assyrian god Sakkuth.3\u00b0 The Masoretic version is thus interpreted this way: In his accusation of Israel, Amos con- demns the people to carry these idols, Sikut and Chiun, with them into the coming Babylon- ian exile as punishment for having worshipped them in his day. We will not here enter into a discussion concerning which version is to be preferred.3! To us, whether Chiun was worshipped by the Israelites during the time of Moses or the days of Amos does not change the fact that the Israelites did worship this god. Nor does it change the fact that this deity was no other than the Saturn of other nations. There will now be those who will want to tell me that it is no secret that the Israelites of- ten fell prone to worshipping false idols and that the case in question reflects no more than that. And, in truth, this is the way in which the verse has been understood by adherents of both the Gentile and Hebrew versions. The association of Shabtai/Saturn with the Hebrew Sabbath, however, as well as the additional data we will be presenting in the following pages, including, incidentally, the very name of Israel, speaks against this. Moreover, hidden within the expression of the Masoretic version of Amos is a datum that will actually strengthen our case. Here I can safely state that even were sikut (that is \u201ctents/tabernacles\u201d) made to read Siccuth (in reference to the Assyrian Sakkuth), it would in no way invalidate our thesis. Not only would the Saturnian connection of this verse remain through the undisputed inclusion of Chiun/Kewan, but, ironically, the Assyrian god Sakkuth is himself associated in Akkadian texts with the planet Saturn.32 Now it so happens that, just as Shabtai/Saturn translates as \u201cthe resting Planet,\u201d so is Chiun/Saturn related to a similar characteristic. The word chun, from which the name is de- rived,?3 carries the meanings of \u201cestablish,\u201d \u201cfix and/or fixed,\u201d \u201cfirm,\u201d and \u201cstable.\u201d34 Very much like Shabtai, Chiun can therefore be translated as \u201cthe fixed, firm, or stable planet Sat- urn.\u201d In other words, the reference is to a planet at rest. What could this mean? THE STABLE ONE The old west Semitic deity named Hammu has long been considered to be a sun god.35 This is the deity for whom the famous Hammurabi, the first king of the Amorite Dynasty of Babylon, was named (or named himself).36 Hammu\u2019s identity as the Sun has been seen to be strengthened by the name of Hammurabi\u2019s fourth successor, Ammizaduga, which name translates as \u201cAmmi |that is Hammu] is Justice.\u201d This, as Julius Lewy pointed out, accords well with the Assyro-Babylonian Shamash who, in Akkadian hymns, is invoked as kittum, that is \u201cjustice.\u201d37 As we have seen, however, Shamash had originally been a name reserved for the planet Saturn. Should we not then see in Hammu a name for the same planet? Thus, for instance, Hammurabi, named after Saturn, would not have been guilty of apostasy when",

        "main_text": "he named his son Samsuiluna, a name usually translated as \u201cThe Sun is Our God,\u201d38 but more correctly rendered \u201cSaturn is Our God,\u201d since both Shamash (Sama or SamSu) and Hammu were different names for the same planet.3? Likewise, when Hammurabi had the laws for which he became famous inscribed on a stela, he had himself depicted as receiving them from Shamash. One cannot, therefore, rightly blame mythologists for identifying Hammu as a sun-god since, in effect, he was the personification of just that\u2014a sun; the pri- meval Saturnian sun to be sure, but a sun nonetheless. The association with justice, however, is not the only datum on which we can base the identification of Hammu as a personification of the planet Saturn? As Lewy noted, Hammu is equivalent to \u201cAman which was a name for the planet Saturn.\u201d How is this identity derived? \u2019AmAn, as well as other related names, belong to a linguistic root which means \u201cstable\u201d and/or \u201cthe stable one.\u201d And, as Lewy pointed out, \u201cthe stable one\u201d is the meaning of the Akkadian name of Saturn, that is Kaimanu, the same as the Arabic Kaiw4n and the Syriac K\u00e9w4n,*! the Chiun of the Book of Amos. Morris Jastrow tells us that the reason Saturn was called \u201cstable\u201d and/or \u201cregular\u201d and/or \u201csteady\u201d was \u201cbecause of the slow and regular motion which is [the planet\u2019s] distinguishing feature.\u201d 42 To be sure, this is the usual explanation that is still given to account for the close- to-universal ancient belief we are here considering. But while \u201cstable,\u201d \u201cregular,\u201d and \u201csteady,\u201d may account for the slowness of the planet as seen with the naked eye from Earth, its slowness cannot be made to account for its additional characteristics of being \u201cfixed\u201d or \u201cfirm,\u201d to say nothing of it being described as being \u201cat rest.\u201d Slow the planet may seem to move, but it moves. What the ancients seem to be telling us here is that, in a time long gone by, the planet Saturn did not appear to move. Can this be validated? THE GOD OF JERUSALEM The claim that the famed Ebla tablets have shown that Salem and Jerusalem were two dif- ferent places\u00ae has not been validated. We must therefore continue to accept the statement of Flavius Josephus who claimed that Salem had been an earlier name for Jerusalem.\u201c4 Salem, or shalem, once thought to signify \u201cpeace,\u201d is now known to have been the name of an early Canaanite deity.45 Up until recently, this deity had been identified as Venus\u201c but, as we shall see, this identity does not hold. In Chaldean, Jerusalem was rendered Yerushalem; in Hebrew, it changed to Yerushalaim. Both names mean \u201cfounded by Shalem.\u201d Moreover, in a letter sent to an Egyptian king of the Eighteenth Dynasty, Jerusalem is mentioned both by that name and as Bit Sulmani.47 As Julius Lewy concluded, this letter \u201cleaves no doubt that the city was then known not only as",

Easily coming to mind are such cities as Beth- aven, Beth-El, Bethlehem, Beth-haran, Bethshemesh, Beth-horon, Beth-eden (in Syria), Beth-peor, Beth-shan, and many others. Lewy himself explains such place names as due to the one-time existence of sanctuaries each of which was dedicated to the deity there named.*9 Thus, Jerusalem would have been referred to as Beth Shulman because a temple of Shulman would have existed there. Lewy\u2019s conclusion was that a temple of Shulman supplanted an earlier one dedicated to Shalim but that it did not last for long. During the same period, the name of the city changed from Urusalim to Bet Shulman; but, with the destruction of the Shulman temple, the name of the city reverted back to Urusalim. This would explain why the name Bet Shulman never be- came popular.\u00b0\u00b0 Needless to say, this was all conjecture on Lewy\u2019s part. For one thing, Lewy himself ac- cepted that Shalim and Shulman(u) were slightly different versions of the same deity,>! so that no replacement of sanctuaries need enter the picture. Nor need the name Bet Shulman have ever supplanted that of Urusalim since, in effect, the meaning of both names is theolog- ically, even if not philologically, synonymous\u2014the former meaning \u201cHouse of Shulman,\u201d the latter, as we have seen, \u201cFounded by Shalim.\u201d>? It is thus more than possible that Bet Shulman was merely another designation for Urusalim, the one derived from Assyrian, the other from Chaldean sources. The Chaldean name passed into Hebrew; the Assyrian did not. The one became popular; the other not. In any case, whether called by the very name of the god (Salem); referred to as having been founded by him (Urusalim/Yerushalem); or simply called his city (Bet Shulman); it re- mains obvious that the city we call Jerusalem was named in honor and dedicated to the god Shalem/Shulman.\u00b0*3 Indications that this god was worshipped there can be traced at least to the time of Israel\u2019s United Monarchy.* Also rendered Shulman or Shulmanu,\u00b0> this god\u2019s name gave Jedidiah, son of David and king of Israel, his more popular name of Solomon. Rendered Shlomoh in Hebrew, this monarch\u2019s name has also been stated to have been derived from shalom, which, as everyone knows, does, inter alia, mean \u201cpeace.\u201d (Compare also the Arabic salam and Maltese sliema.) The probability, however, is that both the monarch\u2019s name and the word for \u201cpeace\u201d derived from the name of the god. As Roy Rosenberg tells us, Slomoh (Shlomoh) means \u201cbelonging to Salim\u201d5\u201d Biblical theophoric names derived from Shalem are common including the names of kings of Israel and Judah. Among such names we find: Shallum, Shelemiah, Shelomi, Shel- emi (or Shulamit), after whom Immanuel Velikovsky named one of his daughters, and elemoth.",

Perhaps less known is the fact that Salummati was an epithet of the great Assur- nasirpal.5? As a god, Shulman was worshipped in Nineveh and, under the variant Shulmanuha or Shulmanuhi, is found mentioned in Assyrian tablets.\u00a9 Shulman is known to have had a feimine counterpart named ShulmanituS!\u2014but also Shala.\u00ae This goddess\u2014but not Shulman \u2014has been identified with Astarte and Ishtar, both personifications of the planet Venus. Moreover, Assyrian sources define Sulmanitu (the same as Shulmanitu) as distar Urusilimma which Michael Astour has rendered \u201cIStar of Jerusa- lem.\u201d That this goddess was known in Jerusalem is verified by her laudation in the famous Song of Solomon in which she is referred to merely as the Shulammite.\u00ae5 The sacrifices performed in Solomon\u2019s temple were referred to in Hebrew as she- lamim\u2014the plural of shelem. Usually translated as \u201cpeace offering(s),\u201d R. de Vaux is of a different opinion in that shelamim \u201cimplies the idea of a tribute offered to God...\u201d\u00ae If this is correct, the god in question must originally have been Shalem. As they appear in cuneiform, the words salummatu and salummati are usually thought to signify \u201cbrightness\u201d and \u201csplendor\u201d respectively.\u201d As epithets, these descriptive terms were applied to Enlil (Saturn), Nergal (Mars), and Nabu (Mercury). On their own, they throw no light on the real identity of Shalem. Who, then, was this god? Very much like other names of Saturn, Shalem (or Salim) meant \u201cthe Stable One.\u201d\u00a9 Solomon\u2019s name, \u201cbelonging to Salim,\u201d can then be translated as \u201cbelonging to Saturn.\u201d David, his father, must have been very partial to the Saturnian deity for not only did he name Solomon in his honor, but also his first-born son, \"Amnon, which means \u201cbelonging to *Amin\u2014i.e. the Stable One,\u201d and even his third, AbSalom, which means \u201cthe Father is Salim.\u201d It can now safely be said that Jerusalem was the City of Saturn, a conclusion that was additionally reached by Lewis Greenberg.7!

In two of these letters which Egyptologists have numbered 74 and 290, reference is made to a place which transliterators have rendered differently. In 1915, J. Knudtzon settled on the reading of this place as Bet Ninib\u201d\u2014i.e., House of Ninib. Some time later, in 1940, Julius Lewy re-read the name of this place as Bit Shul- manu\u2014House (or Sanctuary) of Shulman.\u201d William Albright did not accept Lewy\u2019s transliteration, claiming that the ideogram which he read as \u201cShulmanu\u201d did not incorporate the determinative for divinity.\u201d In 1969, the team of Tadmor and Kalai re-read the ideogram again, this time as Beth Nin- urta. Which, then, was the correct reading? This problem has given birth to many a debate,\u201d but it should never have done so. Let me say that Knudtzon was perfectly correct in reading the name as Bet Ninib since the cuneiform ideogram which \u201cspells\u201d the name of the god in question is \u201cNIN.IB. Of that, there never was any doubt.\" As pointed out in an earlier chapter of this work, Ninib, sometimes rendered Ninip and/or Nirig, was the planetary god Saturn.\u00ae The reason behind Lewy\u2019s re-reading of the name as Shulman may not appear clear to the uninitiated. Suffice it to say that cuneiform characters can be read ideographically and/or phonetically. Thus the ideogram \u201cNIN.IB can also be read \u201cNinurta\u00ae\u2014which means that",

As we have already documented, Ninurta was also one of the names by which the planet Saturn was known. Lewy\u2019s re-reading, meanwhile, was based on an equation which is to be found in an Assyrian explanatory list of divine names. In this list, the Assyrians themselves equated \u00a2NIN.IB with \u201cDI.MES. Just as \u2018NIN.IB can be read as \u2018Ninurta, so also can \u201cDI.MES be read as \u201cShulmanu.\u00ae It therefore follows that, like Ninib/Ninurta, with whom he was equated, Shulman was simply an alias of the planetary god Saturn. From this it can be seen that all three readings\u2014Bet Ninib, Beth Ninurta, and Bit Shul- manu\u2014are correct. They all mean the same thing: \u201cHouse (or Sanctuary) of Saturn.\u201d On the other hand, Albright was entirely wrong when he claimed that the name Shulman did not incorporate the determinative for divinity. The name Shulman, as it appears in el- Amarna letter 290, does incorporate the determinative \u2014dingir\u2014for divinity. Lewy repro- duced it by the usual transliteration\u2014 viz., \u201cSulmani.\u201d\u2122 The equation of Shulman with Ninurta/Saturn, as revealed in the above, is of additional importance to the subject of this chapter because, very much like Shulman/Shalem, Ninurta was also considered an immobile god. Thus, in Akkadian, Ninurta was styled kaimanu, that is \u201cthe steady star.\u201d\u201d (For those in the know: The association of Shulman with Resheph, like that of Ninurta with Nergal, will be discussed in a future work.) THE MESOPOTAMIAN EVIDENCE While we have already seen that one of the Assyro-Babylonian names for the planet Sat- urn was (Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-US, we have so far refrained from saying what the name stood for. Simply put, Lu-Bat Sag-U\u00a7 means \u201cthe steady planet.\u201d The term \u201csteady planet\u201d is not much different than the term \u201cstable planet,\u201d so that we can see that this characteristic of the Saturnian deity was by no means a rarity. In keeping with this topic, we also find that Shamash/Saturn was said to have occupied \u201cthe house of rest.\u201d\u00ae Here there is no intimation of slow movement. A deity who occupies a house of rest must himself be at rest. When speaking of the Sumerian god Ea, Berossus, writing in Greek, used the name Kro- nos\u201d who was Saturn. And did we not, in Chapter 6, see Ea identified precisely as that very same planet? The Babylonian name of Ea was Enki.\u201d In fact, Ea was actually written with the ideo- gram EN.KI. Our interest here lies in the fact that Enki, who must, therefore, also be equated with Saturn, was known as \u201cthe motionless lord\u201d and god of \u201cstability.\u201d\u201d As the god of sta- bility, Enki compares favorably with Saturn\u2019s epithet as the Stable One.

        "main_text": "motionless lord, we again see that this stability had nothing to do with slowness of move- ment. What is being described here is an immobile god, a planet bereft of motion. THE EGYPTIAN EXPLICITNESS When we come to Egypt, there is no longer any ambiguity concerning the Saturnian char- acteristic we have been investigating. In a hymn to Ra, the deity is addressed with these words: \u201cO thou firstborn, who dost lie without movement...\u201d Here, once again, it remains for Egyptologists to explain why, if Ra was truly the Sun, it was described as lying \u201cwithout movement.\u201d Ra, it was said, \u201crests on his high place.\u201d\u2122 Atum was also said to have been immobile. Called \u201cthe Firm Heart of the Sky,\u201d it was distinctly said of him that \u201cthe Great God lives fixed in the middle of the sky.\u201d In the Papyrus of Ani, the deceased is addressed with these words: \u201cO thou who art with- out motion like unto Osiris!\u201d\u2014and this phrase is twice repeated.\u201d The immobility of Osiris is also mentioned in the Text of Teta: \u201cThou art stable in thy name of \u2018Menu\u2019,\u201d it is there stated, where \u201cMenu\u201d itself has the meaning of \u201cStable One,\u201d\u201d the very same epithet we have found attached to other Saturnian deities. The Egyptian god Ptah, whom we have also seen being identified as a personification of Saturn, was also syncretized with Tenen or Tatanen, a primeval deity who was also lauded as the Disk of Heaven,\u00ae a definite identification of the god as a celestial body. Here, Wallis Budge informs us that the \u201cexact attributes\u201d of this deity \u201cappear to have been unknown even to the Egyptians.\u201d\u201d And yet, he had no difficulty in deriving the god\u2019s name from the word enen, or nen, which means \u201cinertness, inactivity, rest, motionless,\u201d and the like\u201d Despite Budge, what this really tells us is that Tenen was considered to be without motion. If this god can truly be equated with Saturn, as his assimilation with Ptah forces us to conclude, it would again register the planet in question as having been immobile. SHINING IN THE LIGHTLAND Those familiar with Egyptian mythology, especially Egyptologists, can\u2014actually should\u2014raise one telling objection against all of the above. And the objection is this: that, despite his being lauded as lying without movement and as resting on his high place, there are various tracts which describe Ra as rising and setting. For instance, in a hymn to Ra, the god is lauded with the words: \u201cHomage to thee, O thou who art Ra when thou risesth and Temu [that is Atum] when thou settest. Thou risest, thou risest, thou shinest, thou shinest, thou who are crowned king of the gods. ..the company of the gods rejoice when thou risest...\u201d!",

Homage to thee...when thou risest on the horizon and sheddest thy beams of light...Homage to thee, O thou who risest in the horizon as Ra...\u201d!\u201d How, then, can we reconcile the above passages, and many more like them, with the idea of a motionless Ra? Well, in the first place, the word translated as \u201chorizon\u201d \u20143ht\u2014actually means \u201clight- land,\u201d'\u00ae and while this term continues to be accepted as meaning \u201chorizon,\u201d it should never have been. In the second place, the word translated as \u201crises\u201d actually means \u201cshines,\u201d as Patricia Spencer indicated.\" There are various Egyptian words which carry these ambiguous mean- ings. Nen, for instance, means \u201cto rise,\u201d often used in relation to a celestial body, but it also means \u201cto shine.\u201d'\u00ae More than that, as we have just seen, nen also carries the meanings \u201cin- ertness, inactivity, rest,\u201d and \u201cmotionless.\u201d Khaut signifies the \u201crising of a god,\u201d but also \u201cappearance, splendor, radiance, or brilliance of a god.\u201d\"\u00ae Skhai means \u201cto make to rise up,\u201d but also \u201cto appear.\u201d \u201d When it comes to the rising of the very Ra in question, one word that is often used is kha or khai, meaning \u201cto rise\u201d or \u201cto ascend,\u201d but also \u201cto shine\u201d or \u201cto ap- pear.\u201d 18 So, similarly, with such words as pert (to come forth),'\u201cuben (to grow bright), and un. As for \u201csetting,\u201d there is an Egyptian word\u2014urt\u2014which has been rendered as meaning just that, but it is only used for \u201cthe setting of a star.\u201d'\"' On the other hand, a related word\u2014urt-t\u2014actually means \u201cimmobility,\u201d while Urt refers to \u201ca motionless god.\u201d'\u201d Egyptologists who have translated such phrases as \u201cO thou who risest in the horizon as Ra\u201d did so because the words \u201cO thou who shines in the lightland\u201d made little sense. On the other hand, and in face of the fact that Ra is often described as having been motionless, trans- lators should have kept these additional meanings in mind. A motionless god, or celestial body, that rises and sets is an impossibility. A god, or celestial body, that shines without movement is not. Thus, As David Talbott indicated, the god does not rise or set but comes forth and recedes, that is he grows bright, he shines, and he dims.'\u201d REIGNING EM HETEP We have already seen it said of Atum that he \u201clives fixed in the middle of the sky.\u201d Inter alia, the god was also said to have reigned in peace. \u201cHomage to thee, O thou who art in peace,\u201d is a phrase twice repeated in the Papyrus of Mut-hetep. \u201cCome, come in peace!\u201d he is implored, \u201cthou wakest in peace...\u201d!*",

We have also seen that the name of this god translates as \u201cthe Stable One.\u201d But what, then, is the con- nection between peace and stability? The Hebrew shalom derives from shalam, which means \u201cto be safe.\u201d \"> So, also, with the Maltese sliema which also means \u201csafety.\u201d\"\u00b0 \u201cPeace\u201d and \u201csafety\u201d are allied terms but, in a sense, is not also \u201cstability\u201d? Now, as it happens, the Egyptian word sharm\u2019 means \u201cto be peaceful,\u201d but also \u201cto be idle\u201d\"\u201d\u2014that is \u201cto be doing nothing,\u201d which negates motion. Another Egyptian word meaning \u201cto be at peace\u201d is heri, but heri also means \u201cto rest.\u201d\"* The Egyptian word most commonly used for \u201cto be at peace,\u201d however, is hetep which also means \u201cto repose,\u201d \u201cto rest,\u201d and \u201cto be at rest.\u201d\" This, then, raises the question: Given that Atum was described as being fixed in the mid- dle of the sky, what is the logical characteristic to be allotted him when he is stated to have been em hetep \u2014to have been at peace, or to have been at rest? This, incidentally, brings us back to the god Imhotep\u2014the same as Em Hetep\u2014and makes us ask the question: Was Imhotep really the deified architect who built Djoser\u2019s pyra- mid, as generally believed? Or was he yet another manifestation of the immobile god we have learned to recognize as Saturn? Talbott, who embraced the meaning of this god\u2019s name as \u201cthe one who comes forth while standing in one place,\u201d seems to have had no doubt. IMMOVABLY FIXED The Egyptian Ra is not the only supposed sun-god said to have been devoid of mo- tion. In chapter 3 we saw the Indic Surya called Suraj, which latter name belongs to the planet Saturn. We also noted there that Surya is said to have occupied samanam dhama, \u201cthe same place of rising and setting.\u201d We did not there explain the meaning behind this term, having used it only to denote that Surya could not possibly have been the present Sun. What is easier to believe, that a celestial body can climb vertically up the sky and vertically down on the same path, or that it brightens and fades while remaining in the same spot? In view of what we have now disclosed, does not the latter seem preferable? In fact, we can state it un- equivocally, since it is unambiguously written that Surya \u201cstands firmly,\u201d and he does so on a \u201csafe resting place.\u201d The belief in Surya\u2019s immobility was so ingrained that he continued to be remembered as \u201cthe immovable center of his system.\u201d \u201d So how can Indologists continue to perpetrate the disinformation that Surya is the Sun? Even Brahma, we are told, does not rise and set. He \u201cremains alone in the center.\u201d'\u201d And if there are those who think that this immobility may have applied to planetary deities, but not necessarily to the planets they once personified, they are mistaken. Sthirah, for instance, is yet one more Sanskrit name for the planet Saturn.\u201d No deity is involved here. And yet we",

It is a pure astronomical assertion deduced from the very meaning of the planet\u2019s name. THE NEVER-SETTING PLANET Lynn Rose deduced that the bizarre astronomical system of Philolaos, the Pythagorean philosopher from Souther Italy, was merely a \u201cgarbled\u201d version of the primeval Saturnian system. This, needless to say, led him to the conclusion that the Central Fire of which Philolaos spoke was really an allusion to the old Saturnian sun. As Rose then tells us: \u201cHistorians of philosophy are fond of referring to the \u2018dark sayings\u2019 of Heraclitus. If Heraclitus was at times reflecting back to conditions during the Age of Kronos, per- haps we are now in a position to understand some of his mysterious remarks. The Central Fire is always at the same location in the sky (as viewed from one spot); this may be why Heraclitus asks, \u2018How can anyone hide from that which never sets?\u201d\u201d!\u201d As Rose continues: \u201cEven some of the Philolaos fragments, although their authenticity has been ques- tioned, make more sense now We are also told that \u2018it [the Central Fire] is ruler and teacher of all things; it is God, One ever-existing, stable, unmoving, itself like to it- self, different from the rest,\u2019 and that it \u2018remains One for ever in the same position and condition\u2019.\u201d'* Greek knowledge of the immobile Saturnian sun, however, was not restricted to the \u201cgarbled\u201d version of Philolaos. In his evaluation of the Greek Helios and other so-called an- cient sun-gods, E. A. Butterworth also came to the conclusion that this luminary \u201cis not the natural sun of heaven, for it neither rises nor sets, but is, as it seems, ever at the zenith...\u201d'\u201d So similarly from other parts of the world. For example, in Roman tradition, among the poets, Saturn was remembered as the god of \u201cthe steadfast star.\u201d 30 The Incas, too, preserved a memory of a sun-god\u2014a resting one, to be sure\u2014who was able \u201cto light the world from one spot.\u201d'' We can therefore be assured that when the Makiritare of the Upper Orinoco River, in Venezuela, tell us that their god Wanadi was \u201clike a sun that never sets,\u201d'\u201d they are referring to an old tradition about the planet Saturn. That Wanadi was not the present Sun is additionally indicated by the fact that the Makiritare name for the Sun is Shi.",

Unfortu- nately for this argument, the Sun does eventually set, and it remains absent for the second half of the year. Besides, while visible during the short summer months, the polar Sun is hardly immobile as it circles around the sky above the horizon. In view of what we have al- ready uncovered concerning the immobility of the primeval Saturn, it is more than obvious that what the Yakut were describing was the dimly remembered Satumian sun. This will be- come all the more apparent in the next chapter when we will throw further light on that ce- lestial locality here called \u201cthe still center of the world.\u201d What we have learned in this chapter, therefore, is self-illuminating \u2014that, still according to the ancients, and during the time we have been investigating, the planet Saturn not only shone as a sun in a sky that was devoid of other astronomical bodies, but, as seen from Earth, this Saturnian sun was seen to neither rise nor set. It seemed, instead, to have radiated down on mankind while being permanently fixed in one spot. How could this have been possible?",

        "main_text": "Chapter 10 The Polar Station A CHOICE OF MODELS iven that Earth was a satellite of Saturn, one way in which the giant planet could have appeared immobile in Earth\u2019s primeval sky is if Earth had been in phase-lock with its primary. This is precisely the case with our Moon which is in phase-lock with Earth. What this means is that the Moon rotates on its axis in the same time it takes it to revolve around Earth. Thus, as seen from Earth, the Moon always presents the same face to us. The other side of the Moon, usually called the far side, is not visible from Earth. (It was revealed to Earth-bound eyes for the first time through the photographic capabilities of twentieth century space-probes.) What this also means is that, as seen from the lunar hemisphere facing Earth, as those astronauts who landed on the Moon could see for themselves, our world appears motionless, that is fixed in one spot, pasted on the darkness of the lunar sky. Whether Earth appears stationary at the zenith of the lunar sky, half way down the sky, or permanently fixed on the horizon, or even half hidden by the horizon, would depend on the lunar locality from which it is viewed. There is, of course, no need to point out that, from the far side of the Moon, Earth is simply not visible. As Alan Stern and Jacqueline Milton pointed out, a similar situation, but somewhat in reverse, holds for the planet Pluto and its satellite Charon. Since Charon\u2019s orbital period is the same as Pluto\u2019s rotational period, to a Plutonian, Charon would appear to be similarly fixed in the sky.! (Patrick Moore misspoke when he called this \u201ca situation unique in the Solar System,\u201d? since he seems to have forgotten the case of the Moon when he penned these words.) There is another way in which Saturn could have appeared immobile in Earth\u2019s sky. This could have come about if Earth had been suspended directly \u201cbeneath\u201d or \u201cabove\u201d one of Saturn\u2019s poles, with both planets sharing the same axis of rotation. In that case, Saturn would have appeared fixed in Earth\u2019s north or south celestial sphere. This, however, is not only an unheard-of situation which is nowhere duplicated in our present Solar System, it is also one which defies presently accepted celestial mechanics. All it inspires is disbelief. It is, therefore, understandable that, in his Saturnian scenario, as extracted from the \u201cgarbled\u201d system of Philolaos, Lynn Rose opted for an Earth in phase lock with Saturn.3 And yet for years I had reason to object to Rose\u2019s explanation of this phenomenon,+ just as he found reason to object to mine\u00ae>\u2014since, almost from the very start of my research, I had come to the conclusion that Saturn\u2019s proper placement in Earth\u2019s primordial sky had to have",

The answer is simple enough: That is where the mytho-historical record places the primeval Saturn\u2014plumb in the centre of Earth\u2019s north celestial sphere, the very place which is presently occupied by the Pole Star. That this is an outlandish theory there is no doubt. Despite the fruit of my research, even I ended up disbelieving the entire thing, and I must honestly admit that it was not until I had read Hamlet\u2019s Mill that I finally accepted all that my research had unearthed. If, as I reasoned at the time, scholars of the caliber of Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend, the au- thors of Hamlet\u2019s Mill, had been able to unearth the same set of bizarre situations in connec- tion with Saturn\u2019s polar station, I could not be that far off the mark myself. If the authors in question could discuss the ancient belief in a Saturn that was permanently fixed in Earth\u2019s north celestial sphere, then so could I. That de Santillana and von Dechend chose not to ac- cept what they themselves had discovered was their business.\u201d But the lameness with which they ended up explaining away what they had brought to light made me all the more ready to accept it all. Now it has to be said that both Rose\u2019s model and mine (as well as David Talbott\u2019s) are based on the mytho-historical record. Let us then examine what the mytho-historical record has to say about the subject. EL\u2014ELOAH\u2014ELOHIM Because we shall be delving more into the Old Testament as we go along, a few words concerning this collection of Hebrew books are in order. The oldest complete version of the Old Testament is the Greek Septuagint (2nd century B.C.). The Hebrew text from which it was translated is no longer extant in any complete form. The oldest Hebrew version that we now possess in entirety is the Massoretic Text (6th to 8th century A. D. ) Not only is there something like eight hundred years separating the two, there are also major differences between them. While the Septuagint is not always to be preferred, it is superior to the Massoretic Text which, beyond dispute, contains more numerous corruptions. To be sure, the Massoretic Text has remained unchanged since its \u201cfixing\u201d in the 6th century A.D., but that a great number of changes had been introduced before that date is also well known.\u00ae Textual comparison has long made it obvious that the Septuagint, compiled by the Jewish scholars of Jerusalem at the behest of Demetrius Phalereus and Aristeas for Ptolemy Philadelphus and the Jews of Alexandria,? was translated from a Hebrew text that was purer than the much later Mas- soretic version. The issue, of course, is more complex than that, but the above should suffice to remind the reader that, when it comes to interpretation, not all versions of the Old Testament are of equal value. In what follows, and throughout this work, we shall therefore be comparing various versions in an attempt to ferret out what the original beliefs might have been. In matters where even comparison will leave us stranded at an impasse, however, it is to the Septuagint that we shall bow our heads, simply because, where no other arbiter is available, it is the oldest version that should receive the benefit of the doubt.",

        "main_text": "What I wish to stress at this point, more than anything else, is that the Old Testament speaks of various deities which, in English and other translations, were changed to read \u201cGod,\u201d \u201cLord,\u201d \u201cLord God,\u201d \u201cMost High God,\u201d etc. Leaving all sectarian biases aside, we shall therefore re-insert the correct Hebrew names of these deities in the quotes we shall be citing throughout the rest of this work. As we progress, we shall also see whether these vari- ous names were merely cognomens of one and the same deity. The first three such names which will concern us in this study are El, Eloah, and Elohim. Now it has sometimes been stated that \u201cElohim,\u201d which name is mentioned 2570 times in the Old Testament,!\u00b0 is \u201cthe plural of a lost singular.\u201d!! The singular, or synonym, of \u201cElohim,\u201d however, is hardly lost; it is merely \u201cEl\u201d and/or \u201cEloah.\u201d!? To William Heidel, the Elohim were the allies of El!3\u2014whatever these might have been. The name \u201cElohim,\u201d how- ever, was not always used as a plural. A. Murtonen, for instance, tells us: \u201cAs to the primary meaning there cannot be any doubt, the word being formally a plural, but the singular mean- ing is also very old, as the Ras Shamra [i.e., Ugaritic] texts prove.\u201d!4 Murtonen goes out of his way in attempting to explain this plurality,!> but, in the end, it seems to boil down to an old usage equivalent to the more modern royal \u201cwe.\u201d As David Rohl succinctly phrased it: \u201cBiblical Hebrew occasionally employs something scholars call the \u2018majestic plural.\u2019 In effect it is a plural ending added to a deity\u2019s name to confer status or majesty. In the Old Testament the best example is Elohim which does not mean \u2018the gods\u2019 but is rather the god El with the majestic plural im appended.\u201d!6 Eloah, on the other hand, only appears 57 times in the Old Testament, \u201cand almost en- tirely in poetry\u201d! such as the Book of Job. That Eloah was the equivalent of El,!8 mean- while, is brought out in the same Book of Job where the two names are used interchange- ably.!9 According to Murtonen, this variant of the name is merely the vocative of \u201cEl\u201d20\u2014that is the form used in invocation. Which leaves us with the shortened form \u201cEl\u201d which, apart from its inclusion in theophoric names, appears 230 times in the Old Testament. ?! That El was the god of Israel par excellence is borne out by the fact that when Jacob arrived in the city of Shechem, in the land of Canaan, following his twenty-year sojourn working for Laban, he set up an altar and called it El-elohe-yisrael, which means \u201cEl, God of Israel.\u201d 22 More than that, however, is the very name Israel itself. Although, as Hans Goedicke noted, all efforts to explain the name have been unsuccessful, it is definitely a theophoric one",

        "main_text": "incorporating the very name of El.\u201d Interpretations of the name have included such lauda- tions as \u201che who fights for El,\u201d \u201che whom El fights,\u201d \u201cthe upright one of El,\u201d and other simi- larities,24 but none of these are true to the etymology of the name. The name \u201cIsrael\u201d appears first in the Book of Genesis where the Patriarch Jacob is described as having wrestled with a mysterious stranger, at the end of which the stranger told Jacob: \u201cThy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with Elohim and with men, and hast prevailed.\u201d25 The name Israel was, therefore, bestowed on Jacob because he \u201cprevailed\u201d like a prince over the stranger with the power of Elohim. And, as it has been assumed by others before me, the name \u201cIsrael\u201d is composed of the word sarah\u2014\u201cto prevail\u201d \u2014and \u201cEl.\u201d Thus it might not be amiss to say that \u201cIsrael\u201d most likely means \u201cto prevail like El\u201d or \u201clet El prevail.\u201d As Ronald Hendel argued, El was the oldest god of the Israelites. This is evidenced by the fact that, in the Old Testament, up until the time of the Exodus, theophoric names incor- porate only the name of El (as, for example, Israel, Ishmael, and Bethuel).2\u00b0 This coincides with what is known of Canaanite religion in the pre-Israelite period. \u201cThe evidence, from Ugarit in the north to Sinai in the south, testifies that during [the pre-Israelite period] the high god of various local Canaanite pantheons was named El.\u201d?7 Murtonen goes even further when he states that the name can be traced to primitive times. \u201cThat \u2019el is a very primitive word is proved by 1) its existence in all the Semitic languages with the (possible) exception of Ethiopic...2) the fact that it was composed of only two radicals...and 3) that these radicals are numbered among the most primitive ones.\u201d\u201d8 As for the origin of El, the same authority informs us: \u201cEl itself can have been derived only from a concrete conception, i.e., from immedi- ate experience. In other words, the question is philologically unsolvable.\u201d29 Philologically unsolvable\u2014perhaps; but not necessarily cosmogonically so, as we shall soon see. We start by asking the question: What could this \u201cconcrete conception,\u201d this \u201cimmediate experience,\u201d of which Murtonen speaks, have been? Having already touched upon the subject on an earlier page, the identity of El should not surprise the reader. Even so, for starters we mention here the fact that, in Akkadian inscriptions, the phonetic writing for EI (or Il) is sometimes used for the logogram otherwise read as An.?\u00b0 In god lists found at Mari, the two names are interchangeable. As Alfred Eaton disclosed: \u201cIt is known that the name El was written with the sign AN (Ik-ru-ub-AN and Ik-ru-ub-Il)...\u201d3! In discussing the same material, Herman Wohlstein argues simply for an identification of El/An as a tutelary deity 32 an equation that could only have been reached because of the widespread acceptance of El, by Jews and Christians alike, as a name simply meaning \u201cGod.\u201d But that \u201cEl\u201d was",

        "main_text": "originally a proper name has been shown by Murtonen.33 Meanwhile, as we have already seen, the god An and/or Anu was a personification of the planet Saturn. Julius Morgenstern tells us that, in his role of the all-knowing god, \u201cEl seems to have much in common with the Babylonian deity, Enki-Ea, the all-wise one.\u201d34 And, on an earlier page, we have shown that Enki/Ea is also identifiable as the same planet Saturn. None of this should really surprise anyone. As Frank Moore Cross indicated, El was the chief deity of the Mesopotamian Semites, as he was also that of the pre-Islamic Arabs besides the Canaanites.35 In fact it has long been known that the pre-Islamic Allah traces to the same root as El or Eloah.3\u00a2 Cross also cites evidence which equates El with the Egyptian Ptah (yet another deity we have already seen identified as Saturn) as also with Ba\u2019al (of whom we shall have more to say elsewhere). William Albright equated El with the Assyro-Babylonian Shamash?\u2019 which, once again, we have already shown to be an alternate name for the planet Saturn. William Heidel goes straight to the heart of the matter when he tells us that \u201cCronos [or Kronos\u2014the Greek name for the planet Saturn] is called El by the Phoenicians.\u201d3\u00ae This identification traces to the Phoenician scholar Sanchoniathon himself, as quoted by Philo of Byblos, who identified the Canaanite El with the Greek Kronos? As Cross submitted: \u201cPhilo Byblius, and other classical sources, and inscriptions in Greek and Latin all establish the formula that B\u2019! Hmn [i.e., Ba\u2019al Hamon] on the one hand, and El on the other, are Greek Kronos, Latin Saturnus.\u201d4\u00b0 Moreover, as Cross admits: \u201cThese equations have long been known, and all new data confirm the ancient.\u201d4! Albright, therefore, was on track when he identified El outright with the Latin Saturnus.*? We did not, therefore, misspeak when, on an earlier page, we pointed out that, according to the ancients, it was the planet Saturn that was really the god of the Jews. When the Old Testament itself, as we have seen, declares El to have been the \u201cGod of Israel,\u201d it is the same as saying that Saturn was that god. And, in fact, is this not additionally borne out by the very name Israel which, as we have pointed out, incorporates the theophoric name of El who was Saturn? Thus, incidentally, when J. Glen Taylor, on Biblical and archaeological evidence, was forced to conclude that it was the \u201csun\u201d that was worshipped in the Jerusalem Temple by the Kings of Judah,3 we can be certain that the \u201csun\u201d in question was the Saturnian one. THE LEFT HAND OF GOD In a Hebrew psalm we read: \u201cUnto thee, O Elohim do we give thanks...When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly...Promotion [i.e., exaltation] cometh not from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South.\u201d44",

        "main_text": "As William Warren asked: \u201cWhy this singular enumeration of three of the points of the compass, and this omission of the fourth [that is, the North]?\u201d4 Is it not, as T. K. Cheyne surmised, because a \u201cpeculiar sanctity is attached to the North in the Old Testament records\u201d?4 And does this not then mean that Elohim\u2019s exaltation can only come from the north? Does this not, in itself, also mean that Elohim resided in the north? And if Elohim, as we have seen, was identified by the ancients themselves as Saturn, would it not also mean that Saturn\u2019s locus was in the north? As Warren continues: \u201cA curious trace of the same conception appears in the book of Job...\u201d47 Here Warren is referring to that specific incident in which Job, while lamenting the bitter deal that fate had dealt him, complains that he has looked for Eloah but could not find him: \u201cBehold, I look forward [or \u2018in front\u2019], but he is not there; and backward [or \u2018behind\u2019], but I cannot perceive him. On the left hand, where he doth work, but I can- not behold him. He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.\u201d 8 Here, the Hebrew word translated \u201cforward\u201d or \u201cin front\u201d is gedem or gedmah which, among other things, means \u201ceastward.\u201d49 As is to be expected, \u2019achor, the Hebrew word translated as \u201cbackward\u201d or \u201cbehind\u201d also means \u201cwestward.\u201d Semo\u2019l, translated \u201cleft,\u201d also means \u201cnorth.\u201d5! While yamin, that is \u201cright,\u201d also means \u201csouth.\u201d52 Job\u2019s words, above, should therefore read: \u201cBehold, I look eastward, but he [i.e., Eloah] is not there; and westward, but I cannot perceive him. To the north, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him. He hideth himself in the south, that I cannot see him.\u201d The designations \u201cin front,\u201d \u201cbehind,\u201d \u201cleft hand,\u201d and \u201cright hand,\u201d for \u201ceast,\u201d \u201cwest,\u201d \u201cnorth,\u201d and \u201csouth,\u201d came into common use among the Semites much later when the Sun\u2014that is the present Sun\u2014had replaced the Saturnian one. Because of other factors which do not here concern us, orientation was indicated by facing east in which the Sun rose. Thus the east was in front, the west was behind, the north was at one\u2019s left hand, and the south on one\u2019s right. But here, now, as Warren noted,*3 is the odd thing about the manner in which Job\u2019s lament is worded. While lodging his grievance that nowhere\u2014east, west, north, or south\u2014could he find Eloah, he made a telling distinction concerning the north. The left hand, that is the north, is described as the place \u201cwhere he [that is Eloah] doth work.\u201d So that, again, we find that it was precisely in the north that Eloah, the same as Elohim/El/Saturn, was believed to accomplish his handiwork. It is, therefore, somewhat ironical that the left hand, the place where the god\u2019s goodly deeds were accomplished, became synonymous with bad luck. Although now obsolete, the",

THE SACRED QUARTER The northern locus of the god of Israel is also referred to in the Book of Ezekiel. When Elohim was said to have revealed himself to the prophet Ezekiel, as described in the very first chapters of that book, he is said to have appeared from the north.55 It was for this very reason that, when the High Priest of Israel officiated at the altar in both the Tabernacle and, later, in the Jerusalem temple, he was obliged to face north. In fact, this priestly ritual of facing north while officiating was practiced by the prelates of other ancient nations, among them the priests of the Haranite Sabzens.5\u201d As A. Fornander noted: \u201cThe Hawaiian soothsayer, or kilo-kilo, turned always to the North when observing the heavens for signs or omens...The ancient Hindus turned also to the North for di- vining purposes, and so did the Iranians before the schism...so did the Greeks, and so did the Scandinavians before their conversion to Christianity.\u201d 58 This northernism, meanwhile, must not be understood in a terrestrial sense, but, rather, in a celestial one. This is brought out by the fact that the circumpolar stars were alluded to as Kokkabe \u2018El (the \u201cstars of El\u201d).5\u00b0 The throne of El was considered to be \u201cthe pole of the uni- verse.\u201d \u00a9 Given all of the above, El (Eloah/Elohim) could only have resided in the north cel- estial pole. As Warren observed: \u201cThe Pole, the unmoving centre-point of the heavens directly overhead, would natu- rally have seemed to be the top of the world, the true heaven, the changeless seat of the supreme, all-ruling God. And if, accordingly, through all the long lifetime of the ante-diluvian world, the circumpolar sky was to human thought the true abode of God, the oldest post-diluvian peoples, though scattered down the sides of the globe half or two thirds the distance to the equator, could not easily have forgotten that at the centre and true top of the rotating sky was the throne of its great Creator, and that there, in the far North, was \u2018the sacred quarter\u2019 of the world.\u201d61 And: \u201cThe religions of all ancient nations signally confirm and satisfy this antecedent ex- pectation. With a marvelous unanimity they associate the abode of the supreme God with the North Pole, \u2018the centre of heaven,\u2019 or with the celestial space immediately surrounding it.\u201d62",

Having, however, seen that, according to the ancients themselves, the god of the Old Testament was really a personification of the planet Saturn, we will have to assume that, as astronomically impossible as it might at first seem, the primeval Saturn was believed to have once been situated in the place now occupied by the Pole Star. One discordant item the reader may have noted concerns the circumpolar stars them- selves\u2014for have we not, on a previous page, argued for the solitude of the very same planet- ary deity, where no other heavenly body was visible. And, to be sure, we will posit here that, while Saturn shone as a sun, no stars, except perhaps those of first magnitude, could have been seen in the night sky. So how, then, could the circumpolar stars have been seen, let alone proclaimed as being the stars of El/Saturn? These stars, which we shall meet again be- low, could not have been considered the property of El during that time when Saturn ruled the pole. It was only when Saturn resigned his lofty position that the stars came into view for the first time. It was then seen that the circumpolar stars circled around that very area in the center of which the god of humanity had once resided. For that reason they became sacred to the memory of the god who had, by then, moved elsewhere. But all this will have to be left for a future work.\u201c What is of immediate concern here is whether this Saturnian northernism is upheld by the beliefs of ancient nations other than the Semites. THE STARS OF ANU In their astronomical treatises, the Babylonians placed their Prime Meridian through the north pole. The Prime Meridian is the point from which star locations are measured. As Norman Schwarz noted: \u201cFor everyone, ever since the time of the Babylonians, the Zero of Longitude was an abstract; for the Babylonians, it was a matter of geography.\u201d\u00ae But then: \u201cIf the Babylonians had been like the Greeks, Spanish, British, etc., they would have put their Prime Meridian through Babylon; but they did not!\u201d\u00ae Instead they chose the north pole. But how does this relate to Babylonian geography? The geography of which Schwarz speaks was not terrestrial, but, rather, celestial. As he himself informs us, the North Pole was \u201cthe loca- tion where the gods had resided,\u201d that is \u201cin the North.\u201d As was the case with El, the northern stars were held sacred to Anu.\u00ae Stephen Langdon tells us that An, or Anu, was associated with the \u201cnorthern polar stars.\u201d At Erech, sacrifices were offered \u201cto the polar stars of Anu.\u201d The Pole Star itself was even called the \u201cstar of Anu.\u201d Thus, a prayer to the Pole Star began with the words \u201cO star of Anu, prince of the heavens.\u201d We thus find out that, in Mesopotamia, the gods were believed to reside in the north. More than that, the prime god of the Mesopotamians, An (or Anu) was not only associated with the circumpolar stars, but with the Pole Star itself. That Anu (or An) was a personifica- tion of the planet Saturn, we have seen on an earlier page. That the Pole Star was revered as the star of Anu is thus understandable. As we explained in relation to the circumpolar stars themselves, once the planet Saturn was removed from its north polar placement, the Pole Star would have been seen to have taken its place.",

        "main_text": "UNAS AND THE CIRCUMPOLAR STARS During the first four hundred years of Egypt\u2019s Old Kingdom, royal tombs were covered with rounded mounds which later evolved into stepped pyramids. These were located in tra- ditional ancestral cemeteries at Abydos and Saqgqara. It is of interest that, associated with these tombs were vast rectangular niched enclosures the long sides of which ran north to south. Royal officials also built their tombs in ancestral cemeteries apart from those of the kings. They, too, were oriented north-south.\u201d As Ann Macy Roth pointed out: \u201cBoth the orientation and the size of these early burial complexes provide clues to the ancient Egyptians\u2019 beliefs about immortality. The tombs\u2019 sloped northern entrance pointed to stars in the northern sky that never sank below the horizon [the circumpo- lar stars]\u2014suggesting that immortality could be attained by joining these \u2018unwearying\u2019 stars.\u201d\u00ae By the end of the Third, and the beginning of the Fourth, Dynasty, royal burials shifted to within true smooth-sided pyramids. Roth was of the opinion that the change came about be- cause \u201cthe diurnal death and rebirth of the sun supplanted the perpetual northern stars as the most important symbol of the afterlife.\u201d\u00ae But, other than the recognition that Ra originated as a personification of the planet Saturn, rather than the Sun, Roth\u2019s conclusion is altogether erroneous because, even in the pyramids she herself mentions, the connection with the cir- cumpolar stars continued to be retained. In the Pyramid Texts found inscribed on the walls of the Pyramid of Unas, the circumpo- lar stars are indirectly associated with Atum. The text deals with the final location in the sky that Unas is meant to achieve after his death. There it is stated: \u201cThe Father of Unas, Atum, seizes the arm of Unas and he assigns Unas to...the Cir- cumpolar Stars.\u201d\u201d \u201cThou art to purify thyself with the cool water of the Circumpolar Stars.\u201d\u201d \u201cThe sun-folk shall call out to you, for the Circumpolar Stars have raised you aloft.\u201d\u201d From this it becomes obvious that, in order to reach his final resting place in the here-af- ter, and be together with Atum for evermore, King Unas needed to travel to the region of the circumpolar stars. That Atum is to be identified as the planet Saturn need not be repeated. THE EGYPTIAN CREED OF RESURRECTION On the inner side of a lid to a granite sarcophagus discovered at Kom Abu Yasin are recorded the monthly variations of the polar constellation which is usually represented by a bull. In this instance, as in others, the celestial bull is symbolized only by its foreleg.\u201d This symbolism is not merely reserved for pictorial depictions; it is also invoked in verbal incan- tations. Thus, for instance, it is written: \u201cHail to thee, O thou Thigh which dwellest in the",

The accompanying text on the Kom Abu Yasin sarcophagus lid, however, equates Osiris with this heavenly bull.\u201d That the planet Saturn was known as Heru-ka-Pet\u2014that is, Horus Bull of Heaven\u2014is well known.\u201d What is of interest to us here is that the inscription on the lid of the sarcophagus in question can be said to place Osiris, as the Bull of Heaven, that is the planet Saturn, in the north polar sphere. We do not, however, have to rely on this inscription, since it is well known that Osiris was considered the god of the north,\u201d even though, unfortunately, Wallis Budge understood this in a terrestrial way.\u201d But that the northern locality of Osiris was celestial is evidenced by the fact that his abode was believed to have been \u201cpermanent in Sekhet-hetepet, among the imperishable stars,\u201d to which the deceased hoped to ascend.\u201d The \u201cimperishable stars\u201d are none other than the \u201ccircumpolar stars\u201d which, because they circle around the celestial pole, are never seen to dip below the horizon and, therefore, viewed as imperishable by the ancient Egyptians. The same text also speaks of the deceased as moving and traveling, but this should be understood in relation to the journey of the deceased from Earth to the abode of Osiris. This is so true that when the deceased, in this case Pepi I, finally reaches his destina- tion, he \u201cstands up at the north of heaven with him,\u201d\u00ae that is with Osiris. So, likewise, with Ra, as we learn from the same inscriptions inscribed on the walls of the Pyramid of Pepi I. In his afterlife, the king was believed to achieve his spiritual destiny only when he was finally united with Ra in the north of heaven. As it is written: \u201cWhen Pepi standeth upon the north of heaven with Ra, he becometh the lord of the universe, like unto the king of the gods.\u201d* That this is so is also evidenced by the fact that Amon-Ra was said to have resided in the Divine Land. \u201cBeautiful of Face,\u201d he was lauded, \u201cwho comest from the Divine Land.\u201d\u00ae In Egyptian, the Divine Land is rendered as Neter-ta.* Brugsch, however, defined \u201cNeter-ta\u201d or, more correctly, \u201cNeter-ta-Mehti,\u201d as \u201cthe northern land of the gods\u201d and this, as Gerald Massey pointed out, is not to be confused with \u201can elevated part of our earth,\u201d but is to be understood as \u201cthe polar paradise in heaven.\u201d\u2122 For that reason, the deceased was lauded with the words: \u201cMay your face be in the north of the sky, may Re summon you from the zenith [\u201ctop\u201d or \u201ccrown,\u201d really] of the sky.\u201d\u00ae It can therefore be seen that the Egyptians believed that, once dead, they would be resur- rected and made to join their god\u2014Atum, Re, Osiris, all of whom are identifiable as personi- fications of the planet Saturn \u2014in the north polar sky.

But, in view of what has been disclosed above, this should not surprise us. Now, as it happens, in the Bhagavata Purana, the celestial north pole is described as the \u201chighest region of Vishnu.\u201d Again, in the same work, it is stated that \u201cabove Ursa Major lies what they call the highest abode of Vishnu\u201d around whom the stars respectfully go round.\u00ae The question, here, becomes this: Is Vishnu, like Brahma, to be identified with Sat- urn or with the Pole Star? The question seems to be answered for us in the Kurma Purana where it is stated that the Lord Vishnu abides in the place of Dhruva, which is the Pole Star. In other words, Vishnu was not identified with the Pole Star; it is merely stated that he abides in its place. But is there any evidence that Vishnu personified the planet Saturn? Little seems to have been known of Vishnu in the Vedic age, and not much is said about him in the oldest Sanskrit work known to us, the Rig Veda. In later Hinduism, however, Vishnu comes to the forefront as one of the most important deities together with Shiva and Indra. In this later mythology, Vishnu is presented as an oft-reincarnated deity who, to use the very words put into his mouth, comes down to Earth \u201cwhenever order, justice and morals are in danger.\u201d* These reincarnations of Vishnu, called avatars\u2014(literally \u201cde- scents\u201d\u2122\u00ae)\u2014will not here concern us. We will, instead, focus on the primal godhead himself who, among various other epithets, is known as Svayambhu, he \u201cwho exists of himself.\u201d Of more importance to us, however, is that we have it on the authority of both the Vishnu Pu- rana and the Linga Purana that Vishnu is to be equated with Brahma. * Another epithet of Vishnu is Prajapati,\u201d whom we have already seen identified as Saturn. According to the Brahma Purana, one of his manifestations is that of Surya.\u2019 To this day, a sculptured depiction of Vishnu as Surya exists in the thirteenth century A.D. Temple of Surya at Konarak, Orissa.\u2019 Yet one more epithet of the god is Yamakilah, derived from Yama.'\u201d As we pointed out in our first chapter, the Linga Purana tells us that \u201cthe great planet Shaniscara, the slow- moving Saturn, is Yama, the lord of the worlds.\u201d'\u00ae And, to be sure, that Yama was a person- ification of the planet Saturn is well known.'\u2122 In the same Linga Purana, Vishnu is made to claim: \u201cI am Kala.\u201d'\u00ae Not to be confused with Kali, Kala is also a name of Yama'\u00ae who was Saturn. Actually, the name Kala itself was that of the planet Saturn. Additionally, a name of Vishnu is Kalakunchah,\u2019\u201d derived from Kala.",

Now the Linga Purana contains a myth, in the form of a parable, which tells how Dhruva became the Pole Star\"? According to this parable, Dhruva was placed at his station by Vishnu. Moreover, Vishnu impressed on Dhruva that the abode in which he placed him had formerly been his. \u201cThis abode,\u201d Vishnu is made to state, \u201cis mine, the greatest, the steady splendid abode.\u201d The same parable, in slightly different guise, is also contained in the Bhagavata Purana, where Dhruva is described ascending to the highest pole \u201cto the exalted seat of Vishnu, round which the starry spheres forever wander...\u201d '* We can thus see that it was the belief of the Hindus that the polar station had been Vishnu\u2019s, that is Saturn\u2019s, before it became Dhruva\u2019s, that is the Pole Star\u2019s. Even more intriguing is the fact that, elsewhere, we learn that Dhruva had previously been one of the names of the Saturnian sun god himself. Thus, the word dhruva means \u201cfixed, firm, stable, permanent, constant, unchangeable\u201d'*\u2014which is an apt name for the Pole Star. Another Sanskrit word with similar meanings of \u201cfixed, firm, unalterable, imper- ishable, indestructible, undecaying\u201d is akshara.\" It is therefore noteworthy that one of Vishnu\u2019s epithets is an amalgam of these two words\u2014 Dhruva-akshara. '\u201d We have seen that, according to the Linga Purana, \u201cShaniscara, the slow-moving Saturn, is [called] Yama\u201d \u2014a name that was also borne as an epithet by Vishnu. It is interesting, then, that, as Warren tells us, Yama, too, once occupied the north celestial polar station. In his treatment concerning the north polar placement of various deities, he wrote: \u201cThat the East Aryans had the same idea is also evident from the Laws of Manu. Among this people Yama\u2014the same as the Iranian Yima\u2014was the first man. His first abode...was at the North Pole...\u201d\"* And, like their Iranian counterparts, and others from other parts of the ancient world, the Hindus also faced north for divining purposes.\"",

As Warren tells us: \u201cThe oldest traceable worship among the Chinese is that of Shang-te [or Shang-ti], the highest of all gods...Shang-te is usually...described as the god of heaven. But his proper place of abode, his palace, is called Tsze-wei. And if we inquire as to the meaning and location of Tsze-wei, the native commentators upon the sacred books inform us that it is \u2018a celestial space about the North Pole\u2019.\u201d\"\u201d Thus we find it stated that \u201cShang-te\u2019s throne is in Tsze-wei, i.e., the Polar Star.\u201d And: \u201cImmediately over the central peak of Kwen-lun appears the Polar Star, which is Shang-te\u2019s heavenly abode.\u201d Shang-ti\u2019s title was The Holy and Propitious Prince of the North Pole.'\u201d One of his symbols, upon which he is sometimes depicted as standing, was the tortoise. The tortoise is also sometimes accompanied by a snake. It is therefore noteworthy that the sym- bolism of the tortoise and serpent goes at least as far back as the Han dynasty and was used as an emblem for the northern region of the world.\u201d More than that, as Lord of the Centre, Shang-ti was also revered as Huang- ti,\u201c who is perhaps better known as the Yellow Lord\u2019\u00ae or Yellow Emperor. % The Yellow Emperor has long been acknowledged to be the representative of Saturn. When it comes to ancient Chinese lore, however, we need not merely rely on the mytho- historical record. Their astronomy echoed the same message. Thus, for instance, the Chinese referred to the Pole Star as T\u2019ien-Tchou which, appropriately enough, means \u201cPivot of the Sky.\u201d Stars which are close to the Pole Star were also referred to as \u201cpivots.\u201d'* The same name was additionally applied to two stars in the constellation Draco\u201d and, since Draco had been the polar constellation around 2300 B.C., some authorities have concluded that this proves that Chinese observational astronomy dates to at least that remote time. Be that as it may, the term \u201cpivot\u201d for these Draconian stars fits in with their former polar, or near-polar, location. What has baffled commentators on ancient Chinese astronomy, however, is the fact that the planet Saturn is given the name Tchou-niou-tchi-chin, which translates as \u201cGenie [or spirit] of the Pivot,\u201d since this is tantamount to calling Saturn \u201cthe Soul of the Pole Star.\u201d That, to the Chinese, the planet Saturn once occupied the north polar center is actually well known. As Jan Sammer indicated: \u201cAccording to the Han historian Ssuma Ts\u2019ien, the planet Saturn \u2018corresponds to the center ...

THE EUROPEAN EVIDENCE It was no different in ancient Greece. In neo-Platonist philosophy, for instance, Kronos/Saturn was associated with the pole.'\u201d Orphic thought also identified Chronos who, as we shall see, was the same as Kronos, as the power behind the turning of the heavens around the polar axis.'\" It is therefore no surprise that, when praying, the ancient Greeks, too, faced to the north. = In time, the sacredness of the north was bound to touch terrestrial realms which, in Euro- pean thought, remained philologically bound to Saturn through Kronos. The Greeks them- selves referred to the North Sea as Kronios Okeanos, or the Saturnian Sea.'\u00ae The adjective \u201cCronian,\u201d derived from \u201cKronos,\u201d has even survived in the English language as descriptive of the Arctic Ocean.'* As Warren discovered, the same idea persisted in Etruria, before Rome: \u201cVarro and other Latin writers confirm this general representation, so that all modern expounders of the old Etruscan religion unite in locating the abode of the gods of Etruria in the Centre of Heaven, the northern circumpolar sky. Niebuhr and other au- thorities of the highest rank assure us that the Romans shared the same faith.\u201d'* Thus, Ovid, in his Fasti, offers a description of Creation, at the conclusion of which Janus is made to state: \u201cThe guardianship of this vast universe is in my hands alone, and none but me may rule the wheeling pole.\u201d * As Roger Ashton indicated: \u201cThe centre of the wheeling pole is motionless to the terrestrial observer. Janus, ruler of the motionless celestial pole, must thus be located at the Celestial Pole.\u201d 197 When Saturnus was flung down from his celestial seat, he was said to have continued ruling from \u201cthe opposite end of the world axis,\u201d\"* which presupposes a former position cor- responding to the northern polar station. But even here, we do not really require such a cir- cuitous route to the Latin Saturn\u2019s former polar placement since Saturnus himself was re- membered as the god of \u201cthe steadfast star,\u201d\u2019\u201d which star is understood as the Pole Star.",

        "main_text": "SINTERKLAAS The belief in the northern placement of the Saturnian sun perpetuated itself down through the ages in various mystic societies and other traditions in which Saturn continued to be re- membered as \u201cthe old man who lives at the north pole.\u201d \u00ae If this has a familiar ring to it, the reader is not mistaken. In fact, as Manly Hall observed: \u201cSaturn, the old man who lives at the north pole, and brings with him to the children of men a sprig of evergreen (the Christmas tree), is familiar to the little folks under the name Santa Claus.\u201d To be sure, Santa Claus can be said to have had an entirely different origin, one that stemmed from the life of Nicholas of Myra. While the history of Nicholas is somewhat ob- scure, his cult became a very popular one in Christian circles. What is known of him is that he was the bishop of Myra, in Lycia, a region in present-day Turkey, during the time of the Roman emperor Diocletian (A.D. 245-313). Persecuted and tortured for his Christian faith, Nicholas was then imprisoned until released during the tolerant reign of Constantine. Sancti- fied by the Christian Church, he was honored by Latins as well as Greeks by an annual feast held on December 6th. Nicholas\u2019 connection with the myth of Santa Claus arose out of the legend which claims that he was once responsible for clandestinely bestowing dowries to three daughters of a poor citizen who, not having been able to procure decent marriages for them, was about to give them up to a house of prostitution. This event inaugurated the tradition of giving presents in secret on the eve of his feast day, that is on December Sth. The name Santa Claus itself is merely the English corruption of the Dutch form of Saint Nicholas\u2014that is Sinterklaas\u2014which transpired when the tradition was introduced to Amer- ica by early Dutch colonists. There is, of course, no direct connection between Saint Nicholas and the north pole in which Santa Claus is said to reside. So how did the belief originate? The date of Jesus\u2019 birth has never been ascertained (and it never will be). The Christian feast commemorating the event had originally shifted to and fro all over the calendar. Some- where around 354 A.D., Latin Christians decided on December 25th since this had been the date on which the feast of Mithra, whose religion had become the main competitor of the Christian one, and which had been amalgamated with that of Sol Invictus, was held. This raised dissent among the Christian community of other countries, especially among the Syr- ians and Armenians, who continued to celebrate the birth of Jesus on whatever day their own tradition had dictated. In A.D. 440, however, the Fathers of the Christian Church decided to revert to December 25th as the official date since this was also the day of the winter solstice which had for long been a day of celebration.'\u201d This was also the time during which the feast of Saturn, known as the Saturnalia, was celebrated. Originating as a New Year festival, the Saturnalia was held on December 17th, but was gradually extended to seven days up to December 23rd.'\u201d The Greek, and original, version of the Roman Saturnalia, however, was the Greek Kronia, likewise dedicated to Kronos/Saturn, and this used to be held on December",

And it is the collective strength of such traditions, ranging all the way from Sumero/Babylonian times to the present, that impels one to believe that, as far as our ancient forefathers were concerned, the primeval sun god had once inhabited that place in Earth\u2019s northern sky that is presently occupied by the Pole Star. Although all this might be new to the public-at-large, I am not revealing any, esoteric secrets. Mythologists have known it all for quite some time. Gerald Massey,\u201d William Warren,\u201d Zelia Nuttal, \"Uno Holmberg,\u2019\u201d Ren\u00e9 Guenon,\u2122 and others we have already had occasion to mention as well as those mentioned below \u2014they all wrote extensive works bearing on the subject. As David Talbott noted: \u201c,..the tradition of a former polar god or polar sun has been chronicled by a host of scholars; together they have succeeded in demonstrating a universal tradition. In the late nineteenth century John J. O\u2019Neill'\u201d even recognized the god as Saturn and had to contrive a distinction between the god and the planet to account for the identity. Later, the specific connection of the planet [Saturn] with the Pole was noted by L\u00e9opold de Saussure. But not one of these innovative researchers ever wondered if their polar suns or polar gods might have actually been there!\"\u2122 Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend are prime among those who have re- searched the subject, but have objected to a literal interpretation of what these ancient mes- sages portray. Since their own research took them far and wide across the entire world in digging through the mytho-historical record, they had no option but to accept that, as far as the ancients were concerned, Saturn had once resided in the place now occupied by the Pole Star. \u201cThis is puzzling at first,\u201d they state.\u201d \u201cWhat has Saturn, the far-out planet, to do with the pole?\u201d they ask.\" They even admit that \u201cthe reader is not the first to be perplexed by an imagery which allows for the presence of planets at the pole...\u201d\"* And then comes the ob- jection: \u201cIt is not in the line of modern astronomy to establish any link connecting the planets with Polaris, or with any star, indeed, out of reach of the members of the zodiacal system.\u201d \u2122 So how do they explain the ancient belief in Saturn\u2019s former polar placement? Their answer is that \u201csuch figures of speech were an essential part of the technical idiom of archaic astrol- ogy...\u201d Nowhere, however, do they tell us what it was that gave rise to these \u201cfigures of speech.\u201d Nowhere do they tell us why \u201csuch figures of speech\u201d were thought to be",

And then, would such \u201cfigures of speech\u201d have been incorporated throughout the entire world? Would all the an- cient races have chosen the same \u201cfigures of speech\u201d? Would they all have decided to place Saturn in a locality it never occupied? And would they all have chosen the north celestial pole as that locality? What purpose would it have served? Despite the fact that, in Ais Saturnian scenario, Lynn Rose opted for an Earth phase- locked with Saturn to account for the latter\u2019s apparent immobility, even he had to admit that, as far as the ancients were concerned, Saturn\u2019s stated celestial station was at the north celes- tial pole. So how, then, did he get around the mytho-historical record\u2019s obvious message? Taking a different, and more plausible, tack than de Santillana and von Dechend, he offered the following: \u201cThe traditions about an immovable Saturn atop some special pole made little sense after the Age of Kronos had come to an end. Those traditions were later revised and were attributed to the only \u2018immovable\u2019 point...that could be found in the newer sky. To people in the northern hemisphere...this was the north celestial pole...\u201d\"\u201d And: \u201cAs long as Saturn was atop its pole, the Age of Kronos endured. The immobility of that body was a sign of the stability of the cosmic order. Later...the stability of the north star was seen as an indication that the world or the world age was not yet com- ing to an end. The Age of Kronos had ended when the only immobile body in the sky had left its position atop the axis of the world; that was the main reason that the later ancients looked to the north star: it was now the body that lay atop the axis of the world, and, as long as it remained there, the world was stable. Thus there was a trans- fer from Saturn to the north star, with much attendant garbling. Traditions that em- phasize the north, and especially those traditions that associate Saturn with the north, need to be interpreted very carefully. After Saturn left us, or we left Saturn, there was only one fixed point in the sky: the celestial pole of rotation...Much that has been said about Saturn would, in the absence of Saturn, have been transferred to the only thing in the new sky that displayed the sort of stability that Saturn had once dis- played.\u201d\"* Thus, Rose believes that Saturn\u2019s polar placement was the result of later revisions by those who could not otherwise make sense of the original accounts pertaining to Saturn\u2019s immobility. But, as I had stated once before,\u201d this rationalization is not supported by the mytho-historical record. Rose does not even hazard a guess as to when this revision might have taken place or by whom. All he leaves us with is the statement that it happened \u201cafter the Age of Kronos had come to an end.\u201d Now, while possible, is it probable that \u201cthese traditions\u201d would have later been \u201crevised\u201d just about all over the world? And would they all have been revised in the same manner? Besides, had such revisions occurred, the revisionists would have been bound to overlook some data that would contradict the modified scheme. Yet nowhere in the mytho- historical record can one find such overlooked clues. Could the ancients have been that",

        "main_text": "diligent in expurgating their received traditions? Is it believable that such expurgation would have taken place all over the world with such completeness? Rose correctly informs us that, during the Saturnian age, the planet\u2019s immobility was tan- tamount to cosmic stability. When Saturn\u2019s immobile placement was catastrophically dis- placed, the stability of the cosmic order was impaired. Following this event, the only immobile object in the sky was the North or Pole Star. The immobility of this star became a sign of the stability of the new celestial order. It was because of this, according to Rose, that Saturn\u2019s former phase-locked immobility was transferred to the North Star\u2019s polar station. Yet, as we have seen through the parable of Vishnu and Dhruva, the record dictates exactly the opposite \u2014that the polar station had been Saturn\u2019s before it became the Pole Star\u2019s. After all, what is the point in attempting to reconstruct a cosmic history based on the mytho-historical record if one ends up tampering with that record in order to make the data fit a different model than the one dictated by the record? As Frederic Jueneman once admon- ished, \u201cthe tapestry of myth is intricately woven, and each thread must be followed to wher- ever it leads, however improbable the initial appearance.\u201d Despite the fact that Jueneman himself ended up by ignoring his own dictum,\" the point should be well taken. In Rose\u2019s case, his Saturnian model was supposedly constructed on a system said to have been laid out by Philolaos. But, as I had indicated in an earlier work,\u201d Rose\u2019s model bears but little re- semblance to that system. When he, therefore, calls his scheme \u201cVariations on a Theme of Philolaos,\u201d the emphasis has to be on \u201cVariations.\u201d Rose himself indicated his awareness of this when he wrote: \u201cWe have supposedly been composing variations on a theme of Philolaos, but if there is truth in these variations, it will emerge that Philolaos or someone else was compos- ing variations on another theme, and that what we know as the system of Philolaos is a garbled and misapplied version of or variations on what was once fact.\u201d '\u00ae All of which explains the changes, assumptions, deductions, arguments, stipulations, sug- gestions, ifs, and buts, that Rose was forced to lead his readers through in his effort to make sense of this \u201cgarbled\u201d system and force-fit it into one of his own making. As I have pointed out once before,\u2019* Rose will be the first to argue that this juggling was necessary to rid the system of its unrealistic aspects and supplanting them with something more defensible. Through similar procedures, however, the Philolaos system could be turned into any scheme of one\u2019s own liking. In our own scheme, as presented in this work, we make no changes to the mytho-histori- cal record. We do not assume anything that is not there spelled out. Our deductions are based on what we find recorded. In other words, heeding Jueneman\u2019s admonition, we have taken, as we will continue to take, the mytho-historical record at face value, no matter how improbable its initial appearance may be.

It may now be objected that had Saturn really occupied a position in Earth\u2019s north celes- tial sphere, those people inhabiting Earth\u2019s southern hemisphere would not have been able to see it.

We can therefore add Saturn\u2019s immobility and its polar placement to our growing list of hypotheses which would now read as follows: Hypothesis #1: That, from what can be deduced from ancient as well as primitive astro- nomical lore, Earth had once been a satellite of the planet Saturn which, because of its proximity, loomed large in the sky as a distinct disc larger than the apparent size of the full Moon. Hypothesis #2: That, still according to ancient astronomical lore, during this indetermi- nate period, Saturn was the only visible celestial body in Earth\u2019s primordial sky. Hypothesis #3: That, still according to the ancients, during this same period, Saturn shone as a sun. Hypothesis #4: That this primordial Saturnian sun shone during that time we today call the night. Hypothesis #5: That, as seen from Earth, the Saturnian sun did not rise and/or set, but re- mained visibly immobile at all times. Hypothesis #6: That Saturn\u2019s immobility was due to the fact that Earth was stationed di- rectly \u201cbelow\u201d Saturn\u2019s south pole and that, from Earth, Saturn therefore appeared to be per- manently fixed in the north celestial sphere, the very same place now occupied by the Pole Star. What this also means is that Saturn and Earth were linearly aligned with the both of them sharing the same axis of rotation. Seeing as there are no planets, or other celestial bodies, similarly aligned in the present order of our Solar System, the next logical question to ask is whether such an alignment of planets is physically possible. 2A7",

I will only say in passing that, other than its mythological content, as we have seen, the mytho-historical record also incorporates the world-wide astronomical beliefs of our ancient forefathers, and that these beliefs coincide with their mytho-religious convictions. Ancient astronomical beliefs are therefore here being considered together with mythology as a unified whole regardless of the fact that what is thus coming to light tends to describe a Solar System that was entirely alien to the one we now inhabit. Later in this work we will attempt a validation of the physical feasibility of the model we have so far delineated, even though not all of the players in this unfolding cosmic scheme are yet in place. What I will add here is a reminder to the effect that many were the things once thought impossible which were eventually found to be possible, and that many of these ended up becoming dogmas of science. Easily coming to mind in this respect are the occurrence of meteoric falls, the non-illusory nature of comets, and continental drift. But let us put all that aside for the time being. Allow me instead to concentrate on the demands which our model itself raises, and whether or not these demands can be met. What do I mean by \u201cdemands\u201d? Theories do not stand, if they are to stand at all, in isolation. They raise certain demands. For instance, the theory concerning the nuclear fueling of the Sun demands that the Sun shed a vast amount of subatomic particles known as neutrinos. But, despite large sums of money spent in constructing complex instruments to register them,' not enough neutrinos, if any, have so far been detected. Raymond Davis, who has been \u201ctrapping\u201d neutrinos for decades, \u201chas consistently detected about one-third fewer neutrinos than predicted by theories of the solar interior\u201d?\u2014which means only two-thirds the amount predicted. Most other experiment- ers, however, can only vouch for about one-third the predicted amount? As John Bahcall",

As Marcia Bartusiak reported, this was no contest since astronomers were not about to accept the radical suggestion that New- ton\u2019s law of gravitation tended to break down with distance.\u2019\u00ae As Lawrence Krauss admitted: \u201cIt may be slightly radical to suggest that galaxies are dominated by dark matter.

The theory thus required the same amount of matter that the gravitational model of the universe demanded.\u201d' But where was this dark matter hid- ing? What did it consist of? As Halton Arp explained: \u201cHypotheses include everything from subatomic particles like neutrinos to dark rocks surrounding galaxies...But in actuality, postulating undetected matter is equivalent to inventing observations that do not exist in order to explain contradictions to our cur- rently assumed physical laws...\u201d\u201d It is not that dark matter is not being looked for. Just as in the case of the elusive neutri- nos, sensitive detectors arrayed around the world are waiting to register this enigmatic stuff now said to be made up of subatomic particles and to constitute 90% of the universe.\u201d As of this writing, not a single one of these detectors has succeeded in registering a single particle of dark matter. Douglas Lin tried a different method. With his colleagues, Lin set about comparing pho- tographs of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a neighboring galaxy, taken in 1974 with others taken in 1989, and measuring \u201cthe almost imperceptible distance\u201d that \u201csome 250 stars\u201d had",

And was this the same as detecting the actual missing mass? Lin himself suggested that the missing mass \u201clies in a halo of dark matter extending 300,000 light-years or more from our galactic center.\u201d\u201d\u201d A suggestion, however, is one thing; direct proof is something else. As an editorial comment in New Scientist summed it all up that same year, belief in dark matter is akin to that of 19th century scientists who believed in the just as nebulous existence of aether.\u201d These two theories\u2014the nuclear fueling of the Sun and the Big Bang\u2014should not, there- fore, be allowed to stand, but because science is still optimistic in that it will eventually de- tect both the missing neutrinos and the missing dark matter, they are allowed to stand. Per- sonally, I shall not be using similar optimism as a crutch in an endeavor to validate the Sat- urnian model we have been slowly reconstructing. On the contrary, I aim to present a series of demands which this theory raises, both within itself and also through hard science, and how these can be met. INTERNAL CONSISTENCY The first demand of our theory is an obvious one. Seeing as our model has been con- structed on the strength of the mytho-historical record, the theory demands that the mytho- historical record should be internally consistent. There would be no point in constructing a model based on a record if that same record contains items which contradict the model being constructed. If the model being constructed is to be considered valid, the record on which it is based must be able to test itself. As we have seen, we commenced the construction of our model by zeroing in on the an- cient belief that, once upon a time, to use an old clich\u00e9, the planet Saturn was the most prominent body in Earth\u2019s sky. In order for this datum to be accepted, however, the record should contain additional data which tell us how the planet Saturn could have appeared as the most prominent body in the sky. This demand was met when we found it stated in the same record that Saturn had previ- ously shone as a sun; that it was at that time the only visible body in the sky; and that it was",

The same set of data also led us to believe that, during this same unspecified time, Earth had been a satellite of Saturn. In presenting our evidence that Saturn did in fact shine as a sun, we also had to appropri- ate the roles of so-called sun-gods and present them in a new Saturnian guise. But here, again, the theory demands that the record itself should so identify these deities. In the case of Shamash, which (or who) has for many years been presented by mytholo- gists as the representation of the Sun, we found that this celestial entity was not by the Assyro-Babylonians themselves identified as such, but, rather, as the planet Saturn. In the case of Helios, we have seen that the ancient Greeks themselves had originally used this name to designate the planet Saturn, and that only later was the name imposed upon the Sun. In the case of the Egyptian Ra, the so-called sun-god par excellence, we presented an ostraca which directly identified this luminary as Kronos, which was the name the Greeks bestowed on the planet Saturn. But because this datum is both late and solitary, the theory then de- mands that the characteristics of Ra should not coincide with those of the Sun. And, as we in fact saw in the very first Chapter of this work, the characteristics of Ra as described in an- cient texts fit anything but those of the Sun. So, also, with the Indic Surya, as was pointed out in Chapter 3, and a host of other so-called sun-gods. Our assumption that Earth had once been a satellite of Saturn raises its own demands in that the mytho-historical record should at least contain some data to indicate that Saturn had been close enough to be seen as a distinct and large sphere suspended in the sky. And, to be sure, besides the fact that most of the so-called sun-gods are actually depicted in the form of a disc, we also found it specifically stated that Janus/Saturn, to say nothing of Ataksak, was actually described as a sphere. Additional evidence was also presented from Africa where, to this day, natives of that continent are not only able to point to the present pin-point of light that is the planet Saturn, but insist that the planet is surrounded both by a ring and by a bevy of nine moons. Barring intervention from extra-terrestrials\u2014which we have already had rea- son to discount\u2014the only way in which these natives could have come upon this knowledge is through the assertion of their ancient ancestors who would have viewed the planet at close quarters. In presenting our evidence that Saturn was fixed permanently in one spot, we relied solely on the record itself. But here a disconcerting item reared its ugly head in that various ancient texts describe the Egyptian Ra as rising and setting. The record therefore demands that this apparent contradiction be resolved. In studying the original texts in which these statements are contained, we came to the realization that the risings and settings of Ra are due to mistranslation. The mythological texts in question say nothing about a rising or setting Ra. What they do describe is the \u201ccoming forth\u201d and \u201cgoing in\u201d of Ra. That mythologists, believing Ra to have been the Sun, understood these terms as \u201crising\u201d and \u201csetting\u201d is, of course, understandable. But, in view of Ra\u2019s lack of solar characteristics, and in view of Ra\u2019s identification as an immobile luminary, the terms in question are here understood to refer to the shining and dimming of the Saturnian sun, a cycle which will be explored in a future vol- ume. In its turn, this immobility demands an explanation. From a physical point of view, two mechanisms are possible. The first, and simplest, explanation is of an Earth that was phase- 252",

The second, but more unbelievable, explanation is of an Earth suspended directly \u201cbeneath\u201d Saturn in which the latter would have appeared immobile in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole. This then demands that the mytho-historical record should be able to let us ascertain which of these two possi- bilities, if any, best fits what the ancients themselves described to have witnessed in the sky. As unbelievable as the polar placement of Saturn appears to be, it was found to be this expla- nation which fits the information contained in the mytho-historical record. In fact, the texts state it unequivocally. We can therefore see that, so far, the mytho-historical record meets the demands it itself raises; that each demand that is met raises more demands; and that these demands are also met. It is a snowballing effect that has to be followed, as it will be followed, to the end no matter how big our snowball grows. THE LITHOSPHERIC BULGE Our theory also raises geophysical demands. For instance, we all know how terrestrial tides are raised\u2014at least to an extent. They are caused by the attraction of the Sun and Moon on Earth\u2019s oceanic waters. We know that when the Sun and Moon apply their combined at- tractive force while being at right angles to each other, the tides are somewhat low. The tides become much higher when the Sun and Moon apply their combined attractive forces when in direct line with each other. Now consider: With the massive Saturn in proximity to Earth, the tides that would have been raised should have exceeded those at present. More than that, with Saturn having been positioned in Earth\u2019s north celestial sphere, terrestrial tides should have accumulated at Earth\u2019s north polar region. The hydrosphere, moreover, would not have been the only terres- trial element to respond to Saturn\u2019s attractive force. The atmosphere should also have piled up at Earth\u2019s northern areas. And so, also, should have Earth\u2019s crust. This, then, is what the Saturn thesis demands. Do we find it so? Well, let us be fair now. What was, no longer is, so that we cannot now take a trip up north to see if the water of the world is actually piled up in a tide around the north pole. Earth\u2019s crust, however, is a different matter. Earth\u2019s hydrosphere and atmosphere would have easily rebounded to settle in a more uniform shell around the world once the linear link with Saturn was broken. Earth\u2019s crust, on the other hand, would have taken a much longer period to re-adjust to the new conditions. And since the scenario we have been positing is theorized to have played its drama just prior to the rise of civilization, we should expect this northern lithospheric bulge not yet to have entirely subsided. Do we find any evidence of it? Of course we do\u2014and it has been known since 1958. This might come as a surprise to some because we have been taught since childhood that Earth is an imperfect sphere which is slightly flattened at the poles and distended at the equator. But the orbits of the first artificial satellites, launched in 1957 and 1958, surprised everyone by showing that Earth\u2019s polar flat- 253",

The real shape of Earth, as now deduced, is better described as a triaxial spheroid rather than an oblate one and, as Desmond King-Hele, who conducted a study of the phenomenon, had to admit: \u201cNo one has yet satisfactorily explained why the \u2018stem of the pear\u2019 is at the north rather than the south ...\u201d* To be sure, King-Hele offered the suggestion that \u201cthe al- ternate melting and solidifying of the south-polar ice down through the ages may well have had some influence.\u201d How this melting and solidifying of ice could have resulted in a northern lithospheric bulge, however, has never to my knowledge been demonstrated. True, King-Hele was here appealing to glacial rebound, but it must be kept in mind that the melting and re-solidifying of glacial ice occurred simultaneously in both the north and south poles. Glacial rebound should therefore also have been simultaneous. So why would this isostatic rebound create a lithospheric bulge only in the north? Frederick Hall proved more astute when he pointed out that: \u201c[{The phenomenon] poses a question which, though obvious, is virtually never asked.

This might not be considered much of a bulge but, as a residue, or remnant, of a former greater uplift of land, even meters are of significance. As Hall indicated: \"The small dimensions of this shift indicate the pull was short term (as in centuries to millennia) rather than eons. Furthermore the effect is relaxing, and in geological terms the distorting influence must have been remarkably recent.\u201d*\u00b0 Leroy Ellenberger, an avowed antagonist of the Saturn thesis, found fault with this theo- retical base.

(Besides, as El- lenberger himself knows, and as others have pointed out,\u201d it was not just the positioning of Saturn above Earth\u2019s northern pole that was responsible for raising the world\u2019s lithospheric bulge. There were additional forces which came into play, but it would be premature at this point to go into all that.) And then, is it just the northern bulge per se that we should be concerned with? What about the fact that Earth\u2019s crust is generally thicker in the northern hemisphere than it is in the southern? Sure enough, this has been explained as arising from the additional fact that \u201cmost dry land exists north of the equator,\u201d\u201d but it has never been asked why this should be the case. Exponents of the continental drift theory look at the configuration of Earth\u2019s land masses and conclude that the continents must have once been joined together. I look at the same con- figuration and see something else. I do not, by this, deny continental drift and plate tectonics. But consider: Two of the biggest continents on Earth, and India also, taper toward the south pole. None taper toward the north. The highest percentage of Earth\u2019s land masses, as noted above, occurs north of the equator; the highest percentage of the Earth\u2019s oceans, south of the equator. In the extreme north, the continents come together at the \u201ctop\u201d of the world to form a circle which is filled with the Arctic Ocean. As if to counterbalance this, in the extreme south we see that it is the oceans which come together at the \u201cbottom\u201d of the world to form a circle which is filled with the Antarctic continent. Earth\u2019s axis passes from the centre of the Arctic Ocean to the centre of Antarctica. Is this merely fortuitous? Is it merely by chance that Earth\u2019s land masses are mainly congregated in the north? (As to whether or not the Arctic Ocean existed during the era of Saturn\u2019s proximity, I shall leave to a future work.) There is another problem to consider. Encircling the Arctic Ocean is a blanket of detritus known as muck. This area is so vast it actually covers one seventh of Earth\u2019s land surface.\u201d This muck is composed of deep-frozen \u201cgoo with silt, sand, pebbles, and boulders, often with masses of preserved, semi-decayed, or fully decayed vegetable and animal matter.\u201d This frozen mess lies on low level plains.

The Russians, who own the major land areas covered by this substance have conducted prolonged studies on it for [over] half a century, and have in some places drilled down to over 4,000 feet but still without reaching solid rock.\u201d Although we will have much more to say about the formation of this muck in a future work, the problem we wish to focus on here is this: From what heights did this material erode? As the writer in Pursuit pointed out: \u201c...the lands now blanketed with this material must at one time have been much higher above sea level...\u201d* But: \u201cTo suggest that the uplands from which this stuff came were once much higher and had a steeper run-off is begging the question and doesn\u2019t help at all. Yet there is the bloody muck lying all over the lot and to enormous depths. It has to be accounted for.\u2019 One additional fact to consider is that no such muck exists at Earth\u2019s south pole. THE NATURE OF TIDAL FORCES One might now well ask: Since the Moon also has one side perpetually facing Earth, should it not also exhibit a tidal bulge on that hemisphere? As a matter of fact, it does. This was discovered by orbiting Apollo spacecraft using \u201ca laser device to measure accurately the heights of features over much of the lunar surface.\u201d What came to light is that the Moon, rather than being a perfect sphere, is actually slightly egg-shaped, with its narrow end point- ing toward Earth. This lithospheric bulge rises 2 kilometers above the lunar surface. Unlike Earth\u2019s northern distortion, this is a \u201cliving\u201d bulge, not the remnant of one. Even so, as Har- old Urey noted, this lunar ellipticity \u201cis some seventeen times as great as would be calcu- lated from present tidal forces.\u201d What Urey is saying here is that Earth\u2019s pull on the Moon",

By the same token, however\u2014and this might come as a surprise to some readers\u2014 neither is the Moon\u2019s gravitational pull powerful enough to raise oceanic tides.\u201d And yet it does. Another objection raised by Urey is that it \u201cis difficult to believe that the interior of the Moon can support such stresses for geological periods of time.\u201d*' That may be so, but the bulge is there, so that no matter what forces came into play to raise it, the \u201cinterior of the Moon\u201d does presently support it. There is no point in saying that this is impossible. Moreover, as Keith Runcorn admitted, under present conditions, the lunar bulge \u201cwould have disappeared long ago.\u201d\u201d For that reason, some authorities have been claiming that the lunar bulge is not raised by tidal forces, but by some other unknown mechanism. However, while this is not the place to go into this particular subject, the height of the lunar bulge would conform rather well if it was formed relatively recently, even more recently than the terrestrial one, under conditions other than those presently postulated. One other thing to keep in mind here is that, given what we know, or think we know, about tidal forces, Earth is bound to tidally affect the lunar surface, and that this effect is bound to manifest itself on the lunar hemisphere facing Earth. So that if the lunar bulge in question is not the result of Earth\u2019s tidal attraction, where, then, is the manifestation of that force? Now, as it happens, Ellenberger has had reason to raise further objections to our hypothe- sis concerning Earth\u2019s lithospheric bulge. As he had it stated: \u201c...were the miniscule northern bulge manifested in the geoid truly of tidal origin as claimed, then the geoid would not be pear-shaped, but would instead be a prolate el- lipsoid, with the bulges at north and south. This follows from the elementary fact that tidal bulges express themselves on both the near and far side of the subject body, as with the lunar tide which occurs twice a day...\u201d Roy Gallant succinctly explained the phenomenon in the following words: \u201cGravitation, remember, weakens as distance becomes greater. So the Moon tugs with greater force on that side of Earth facing the Moon, with less force on matter at Earth\u2019s center, and with the least force on Earth\u2019s far side. A second tidal bulge thus forms on the far side where a hill of water is \u2018left behind\u2019. Since this water is farthest away from the Moon, it is tugged with the least force.\u201d The fact that lunar tides affect Earth\u2019s oceanic waters twice a day is due to Earth\u2019s rota- tion as it catches up with the secondary tidal bulge. But even this is nothing but an idealized",

There are many areas which are af- fected by only one tide per lunar day.* Even so, why did not Earth develop a secondary bulge at its south pole? Actually, who can say it did not? To begin with, the hydrosphere is one thing, the litho- sphere is something else. Water, being a liquid, responds much easier to tidal forces than does the solid lithosphere. And then, with the pull from the stationary Saturn being weakest at Earth\u2019s south pole, a secondary bulge at that location would have been much lower than the northern one. Who is to say that a southern bulge did not form under Saturn\u2019s constant pull and that this bulge, being much lower than its northern counterpart, has since completely settled down? Of course, we can never know whether such a southern bulge ever formed. But then, is it adamant that such a southern bulge should have formed? There is no secondary bulge on the Moon counteracting the one facing Earth. But because this lunar bulge has been disqualified as a tidal one, we look for a better example. I therefore point to Phobos, one of the Moons of Mars, an irregular chunk of rock measuring a mere seventeen miles across its longest axis. It, too, exerts a gravitational pull on Mars and, yes, it, too, raises a slight bulge on that planet.\u201d Because Phobos orbits the planet faster than Mars is able to rotate, this Martian bulge tends to lag behind\u2014but there it is, and there is no opposing secondary bulge to counteract it. But then how much do we really know about tidal forces? We know so little about them that we cannot even predict the tide for any point on an ocean.* Oh yes, we can forecast the tides for all principal ports and other shore lines, but \u201cthese are not computed from general theory...but from analysis of tidal records over a long period of years at the particular port concerned.\u201d\u00ae There is also no point in appealing to Isaac Newton\u2019s laws because the Newtonian scheme fails to explain these vagaries.\u201d As James Gilluly and his associates pointed out: \u201cThese and many other facts make it clear that the tides are not a simple direct response to the vertical component of the moon\u2019s gravitational pull, which is really far too small for ef- fective lifting of the water masses anyway.\u201d*' Granted that these words were written in 1951, in the interim nothing much has changed in that respect So what, then, is the bottom line? From the little we know about tidal forces, the Sat- urnian model we have been investigating still demands that a lithospheric bulge would have been raised at Earth\u2019s north pole, and that this bulge would have subsided somewhat once Earth\u2019s linear alignment with Saturn was broken. The remnant of such a northern lithospheric bulge exists to this day. We can therefore safely claim that this demand is met.",

As already noted, there are no bodies in the present Solar System which are linearly aligned.

This is not to be wondered at because the events in question have so far been scattered over an ever-growing array of piece-meal publications without much regard for their chronological order.

Actually, the implication derived from the mytho-historical record is that there was a time when not even Saturn was yet quite visible. The record, for instance, hints at a time when the unseen god was still to emerge from an all-encompassing darkness. Mankind con- tinued to remember this as the time of beginnings, a time before Creation commenced. Thus the later compilers of the Rig Veda could philosophically state that, before there were any gods, there was neither \u201cexistent\u201d nor \u201cnon-existent.\u201d\u2019 And yet there was something which was described in the same source as \u201cthat One Thing\u201d and \u201cthis All.\u201d As it is stated: \u201cThat One Thing, breathless, breathed by its own nature: apart from it was nothing whatsoever.\u201d\u201d And: \u201cDarkness there was: at first concealed in darkness this All was indiscriminated chaos. All that existed then was void and formless.\u201d As we shall soon see, this all-encompassing darkness is spoken of by the mythologies of almost all races. In fact, this milieu is stressed so often that one cannot help but assume that few situations impressed early man as much as this prolonged environmental state. And yet, in this darkness, up in the sky, there seems to have been something indistinct, the \u201cvoid and formless\u201d substance of the Rig Veda. TOHU WA BOHU As David Talbott noted from the very inception of his Saturnian studies, man described the creation of what has been termed \u201cthe earth\u201d as if he had been an actual witness to it all. He was there when it happened and saw it all unveil with his very own eyes.\u2018 Some will counter that this was the natural outcome of man\u2019s budding philosophical yearning. Looking around him, we are told, man would eventually have fallen upon the question of how every- thing had come to be. But, apart from the fact that the doctrine of beginnings was not univer- sally adhered to, why would all those races who believed in Creation have described it in",

Let us then continue to re-examine them. The father of all Creation myths, at least in the Western World, is that contained in the very first chapter of the Book of Genesis. It is there stated that: \u201cIn the beginning Elohim created the shemayim and \u2018eretz. And \u2018eretz was tohu wa bohu, and darkness was on the surface of the tehom. And the ruach of Elohim moved upon the face of the mayim.\u201d* As we have already seen, Elohim was one of the ancient names of Saturn. Shemayim are \u201cthe heavens\u201d\u2014in the plural. Eretz is the word usually translated as \u201cEarth,\u201d but it more properly means \u201cland.\u201d The words tohu wa bohu are traditionally translated as \u201cwithout form and void\u201d or \u201cvoid and empty.\u201d The tehom is understood as a watery abyss\u2014the deep. Ruach means \u201cspirit\u201d or \u201csoul,\u201d but also \u201cwind,\u201d while the mayim are merely \u201cthe waters\u201d \u2014also in the plural. What follows might offend those of a religious bent but, in a scholarly work, this cannot always be helped. Devoid of all religious significance, what the words of Genesis actually tell us is that, \u201cin the beginning\u201d \u2014that is, as far back as man can remember\u2014Saturn fash- ioned the \u201cland\u201d\u2014which originally meant the land of the gods\u2014which was formless and empty, while the \u201cspirit,\u201d or \u201cwind,\u201d of the same Saturn moved over the darkened waters. CHAOS Tohu wa bohu, however, can also mean \u201cutter chaos.\u201d\u00b0 Thus, in the Phoenician cosmog- ony of Philo Byblius, we find \u201cdark chaos\u201d presiding as the ruling principle before Creation.\u2019 It was no different among the ancient Greeks. In describing the Creation as remembered by his countrymen, Hesiod asks: \u201cFrom the beginning, which first came to be?\u201d And he an- swers: \u201cChaos was first of all...\u201d \u00ae Thus, according to Hesiod, in the beginning there was nothing but Chaos, \u201cvast and dark.\u201d This Chaos was surrounded by Night,'\u00b0 which means surrounded by, or enveloped in, darkness. Guirand tells us that, among the Greeks, Chaos was \u201ca pure cosmic principle devoid of god-like characteristics.\u201d'' In this, however, he was simply falling prey to a later philosophic doctrine. Guirand also muddles the issue when he claims that \u201cthe first principle was Cronus, or Time, from which came Chaos, which symbolized the infinite...\u201d!? It is obvious that, here,",

        "main_text": "way of Tao was said to have been the \u201cWay of the Yellow Emperor,\u201d\u2122 that same Shang-ti or Huang-ti we have presented on an earlier page as the very personification of the planet Sat- urn. Thus, despite the different terms in which it is couched, the entity being described, this Tao, appears to be no different than that described by other races as the first principle from which Creation was said to have proceeded. It is upon this \u201call-embracing First Principle\u201d that Lao-tzu was able to base an entire philosophy whose influence on Chinese thought, art, and literature, despite varying interpre- tation, has been prodigious. Taoism, in fact, became the dominant philosophy, called Tao- chia, and even religion, differentiated as Tao-chiao, of China. But that the basic idea behind both derives from the primeval events with which we are presently concerned, there seems to be no doubt. THE NEBULAR CLOUD A Yuki Creation myth refers to this indistinct something as a \u201cfog\u201d and/or \u201cfoam\u201d that \u201cmoved round and round continually\u201d during a time, in the beginning, when there was yet \u201cno light.\u201d?! A similar fog is also mentioned in Oceanic mythology. From Nias we have the fol- lowing: \u201cIn the beginning there was a thick fog, which condensed and became a being without speech or movement or head or arms or legs.\u201d\u201d This being, without head or arms or legs, reminds us of the Eskimo entity Ataksak, whom we have already met, who also was a being without arms and legs and who, very much like the Latin Janus/Saturn, existed in the shape of a sphere. It should also be noted that, while the entity which emerged from the fog was said to have been without movement, which accords well with Saturn\u2019s immobility, the lack of mo- tion does not necessary apply to the fog itself. Here, then, we seem to catch sight of what might have been a spherical body emerging out of a substance which had the appearance of a fog. In their Creation myth, the Pima state that: \u201cIn the beginning there was nothing at all except darkness. All was darkness and emptiness. For a long, long while, the darkness gathered until it became a great mass. Over this the spirit of Earth Doctor drifted to and fro like a fluffy bit of cotton in the breeze. Then the Earth Doctor decided to make for himself an abiding place.\u201d\u201d It is obvious that the entity that was eventually translated into English as \u201cEarth Doctor\u201d was the Pima Creator. Meanwhile, a rotating \u201cfog,\u201d \u201cfoam,\u201d and/or \u201cfluffy cotton\u201d in dark- ness seems to imply a spinning nebular cloud. The whirling nature of this entity is lent fur- ther support by a Creation myth of the Marquesas Islands which declares that \u201cthe primeval void started a swelling, a whirling, a vague growth...\u201d\u201c This would be in keeping with an",

        "main_text": "idea proffered by the late David Griffard who, back in 1979, suggested to this author that Saturn could conceivably have been \u201censhrouded in some obscuration emanating from the parent body itself which blotted out...a good share of its own radiance.\u201d\u00ae This idea seems to be borne out by the Zoroastrian creation myth in which Zurvan was said to have provided, or emitted, the \u201coriginal unformed matter.\u201d\u201d This is very interesting because, for one thing, the Iranian Zurvan was a very ancient deity.\u201d He was regarded by the Zoroastrians as the \u201cfirst principle,\u201d the \u201coriginal seed,\u201d and \u201cthe father of the Cosmos.\u201d\u201d But, more than that, this an- cient deity had a well-known identity. Thus, van der Waerden tells us that, in Armenian texts, Saturn is called Zruan which is the same as Zurvan.\u201d The later worshippers of Mithra were not therefore wrong when they identified Kronos, the Greek Saturn, with Zurvan.\u201d Actually, the identity of Zurvan as Saturn is well attested.\u2019 The implication here is that this nebular cloud was spun off by the rotating Saturnian body out of which the solitary deity\u2014i.e. Saturn\u2014slowly emerged into view. A near-identi- cal idea was later proposed by David Talbott when he stated that: \u201cThere is also evi- dence...that the participating planets [of the Saturnian system] moved through a diffuse gaseous envelope, which almost certainly would have prevented a view of the stars.\u201d*\u201d Griffard\u2019s 1979 suggestion, that an obscuration of sorts could have been emitted by the planet Saturn itself, directed me to the so-called accretion disc, or placental cloud, from which the planets of the Solar System were supposed to have accreted. Dramatic paintings of such clouds by noted space artists such as Chesley Bonestell\u201d have appeared quite regularly in astronomical journals and illustrated coffee-table books. Turning such pictures upside down, so that I could view the entire panorama from below instead of from above, gave me an inkling of what Saturn might have looked like had it also been surrounded by a similar placental cloud. The sky would have been almost completely obscured by the colossal nebular disc. Part of Saturn\u2019s southern hemisphere would have protruded through its equatorial cloud, thus rendering itself quite clearly as a dull red disc to human eyes. What intrigued me about these graphic illustrations many years later was that these circumstellar clouds all had the appearance of a whirlpool that seemed to be composed of both fog and dirty foam (and even greenish fluffy cotton), thus rendering them somewhat comparable to what was described in some of the myths paraded in the previous section. A similar doughnut of gas was found surrounding a nearby star by space scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1985.* Dust disks around so-called newborn stars were",

MOT In Jewish myth, the chaotic bohu was understood as an expanse of mud.\u201d This is identi- cal to the Phoenician mot which was produced at the very beginning of things. \u201cSome say that this [mot] was slime and others a rotting of aquatic composition. From it came all the germs of all created things and it was the origin of everything.\u201d* Now when one examines illustrations of these so-called accretion disks, one can see that these nebular clouds not only look as if they are composed of swirling fog, foam, or fluffy cotton, they also have the appearance of churning mud or slime. Baudissin, on the other hand, supposed the word mot to connote water.\u201d Gaston Maspero likewise understood that \u201cMot...is probably a Phoenician form of a word which means water in the Semitic language.\u201d The Babylonians told the story differently but they, too, held that Creation commenced out of the waters.

The Babylonian Berossus additionally informs us that, during this time\u2014i.e. in the beginning\u2014\u201call was darkness.\u201d Even Tiamat, according to him, was shrouded in darkness. NU Now, as it happens, the Egyptian Chaos was styled Nu (or Nun.)*\u201d But Nu more properly refers to \u201cthe primordial ocean in which before the creation lay the germs of all things and all beings.\u201d* \u201cThe texts call him [i.e. Nu] the \u2018father of the gods,\u2019 but he remains a purely intel- lectual concept and had neither temples nor worshippers. He is sometimes found rep- resented as a personage plunged up to his waist in water, holding up his arms to sup- port the gods who have issued from him.\u201d\u201d It should here be mentioned that while Nu might have had no temples or worshippers, a festival, known as the Per-t Nu, used to be held in his honor.\u201d Of special meaning to us is also the fact that Nu was also a name of Amen-Ra,\u201d our very own Saturn. Thus, in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Nu is made to state: \u201cI am the great god self created...\u201d But then the question is asked: \u201cWho then is this?\u201d And the answer given is: \u201cIt is Ra...\u201d And it was Ra who was believed to have raised all that came into existence \u201cfrom out of Nu.\u201d* As Wallis Budge informs us: \u201cFrom various passages found in the religious, mythological, and funeral texts of all periods it is abundantly clear that in primeval times at least the Egyptians believed in the existence of a deep and boundless watery mass out of which had come into being the heavens, and the earth, and everything that is in them.\u201d Even the Biblical El/Elohim was known as the god of the cosmic ocean. It has, for in- stance, been suggested by Barry Frank that, keeping in mind that vowels were inserted into Hebrew at a late date, the consonants which spell \u201cElohim\u201d can be read as \u201cEl ha Yam,\u201d which means \u201cGod of the Sea.\u201d The same derivation was suggested six years later by Pro-",

        "main_text": "fessor Elihu Katz, but Baruch Margalit shot the idea down.\u201d Among Margalit\u2019s objections was the fact that that the He (i.e., \u201ch\u2019\u201d) in the name \u201cElohim\u201d is a radical, and not the defini- tive article; and that the Israelites were \u201cland-lubbers\u201d and thus not given to oceanic deities.\u201d No one has, however, suggested that the he in \u201cElohim\u201d stands for the definitive article. What has been suggested is that the name \u201cElohim\u201d may have been derived from \u201cEl ha Yam.\u201d Margalit should also have considered that the \u201csea\u201d referred to, as in the Creation myths of other races, was a celestial one, so that the land-lubbered Israelites need not even enter into the picture. To be sure, this derivation of the name will remain controversial, but we do not really require it in making our case. As Frank Moore Cross has indicated, the idea that Elohim was a god of the sea actually traces to an ancient belief. An old tradition which he cited has the deity unequivocally stating: \u201cI am El, in the seat of Elohim I am enthroned in the midst of the seas.\u201d* Elsewhere, however, the Egyptian Nu\u2014this \u201cprimeval abyss of water\u201d \u2014is alluded to as pautet or pautti, which has been translated as \u201cprimeval matter.\u201d Thus Ra is made to state: \u201cI produced myself from the primeval matter [which] I made.\u201d \u201cI produced myself from prime- val matter.\u201d \u201cI came into being from the primeval matter...\u201d It is obvious from all the above that man did not know what he was looking at. If the cir- cumstellar disk we have been postulating as having surrounded Saturn was a fact, we can un- derstand man remembering it as a nebulosity, something indistinct. We can also understand his likening it to swirling fog, foam, or fluffy cotton, even a churning of mud or slime, a cha- otic mess, primeval matter\u2014 but water? Why water? THE WATERS OF CHAOS Up until 1979, I had held the view that the waters of chaos had actually been terrestrial. In fact I had already earlier described these waters as having been piled up in a tidal heap due to the gravitational pull of Saturn which hovered overhead.\u201d Although I still hold to a col- lection of water piled up at Earth\u2019s north polar regions, a topic which will be explored in a future volume, I eventually came to realize, primarily on following the advice of Roger Ashton and David Lorton, to reconsider ancient testimony concerning the celestial nature of the waters of chaos spoken of in relation to Creation. The celestial nature of these waters is perhaps best indicated in Egyptian myth. Traditionally, the Egyptian waters of chaos which, as we have just seen, were collectively known as Nu, were unequivocally described as having been in the sky. Of that there was never any doubt. As Budge tells us, \u201cthe name Nu...is ex- pressed by three vases of water which indicate the sound, and the outstretched heaven...and",

The darkness is over the surface of the deep...Now this concept of the priority of water is fairly widespread among many unrelated mythologies.\u201d Among these unrelated mythologies, one might again point to that of ancient Egypt. While all that was created was said to have been raised from the watery abyss of Nu, some of the Egyptian versions of Creation do not state that the waters themselves were created.\u201d But, in a hymn to Ptah-Tenen, whom we have also seen identified as Saturn, mention is made of a time \u201cwhen the waters had not [yet] come forth\u201d while, a little later, \u201cthe celestial water\u201d is",

Whilst he was worshipping the waters were produced...\u201d\u201d Of special interest here is that what is translated as \u201cDeath\u201d is actually Yama whom we have also presented as one of the Sanskrit names for the planet Saturn.

At this late date it is not easy, if even possible, to reach a definite conclusion. The more important question remains: What were these celestial wa- ters? THE WHIRL OF CREATION All these, and other, myths of celestial waters led Roger Ashton to assume that there must have been some celestial phenomenon resembling shimmering waters, possibly an auroral effect, surrounding the primeval Saturnian orb.\u00ae As he also elsewhere stated, \u201cpart of that assemblage must have looked like waters, whose implicitly or explicitly celestial character has severally been noted\u201d and that these \u201cwaters evidently appeared in a distinct image or pattern.\u201d*' But while an auroral effect might resemble shimmering water, and while this could also be called an indistinct entity, even a nebulosity, it is doubtful that it would also",

But should we let astronomical nebulae\u2014that is circumstellar disks\u2014which are not themselves planetary, dictate what Saturn\u2019s nebulosity would have looked like?

It also appears in Buddhist mythology where the surface of the celestial waters is said to have been stirred by \u201cthe dawn wind of creation.\u201d\u00ae It is then said that the foam of the waters solidified to form the god\u2019s residence.\u201d Here we have a direct connection between the nebulosity that was described as foam and the celestial waters; they were both part and parcel of the same entity. But to continue\u2014what about the myth of the Marquesas Islands? Is it not there stated that the \u201cprimeval void\u201d started a whirling? Ovid also reminds us that Chaos \u201cheaved and turned.\u201d So, also, with the entity called Tao which was said to have been \u201ceternally revolving without fail.\u201d Everywhere, then, we catch a glimpse of this indistinct entity as continually moving round and round, whirling, like a whirlwind in the sky. Why not then a whirlpool, many of",

Even so, in describing the cosmology of the Phoenicians accord- ing to Sanchoniathon, Philo wrote that: \u201cThe first principle of the universe he [Sanchoniathon] supposes to have been air dark with cloud and wind, or rather a blast of cloudy air, and a turbid chaos dark as Erebus; and these were boundless and for long ages had no limit.\u201d It was out of this dark and turbid chaos that Creation was said to have progressed, a de- scription that has more in common with a dark whirlwind, if not whirlpool, than an auroral effect. Something similar is recounted in the Japanese Nihongi as paraphrased by Raymond Van Over: \u201cBefore Heaven and Earth were produced, there was something which might be com- pared to a cloud floating over the sea. It had no place of attachment for its root.\u201d* And so, also, among the Chinese as we learn from the Tao Teh Ching: \u201cThere is [or was] a thing confusedly formed, born before heaven and earth. Silent and void, it stands alone and does not change, goes round and does not weary.\u201d\u201d And did not Ovid tell us that this water \u201cheaved and turned in darkness\u201d?

The northern region in which we have seen ancient man persistently place the primeval Saturn, and therefore the celestial waters associated with him, is here terrestrialized as the northern Arctic Ocean; the darkness in which the celestial waters were enshrouded is here remembered as having enveloped the same Arctic Ocean; the whirling nebulosity in the sky became a terrestrial maelstrom or whirlpool; and even Chaos shows up in connection with it all. Such is the nature of myths and legends. Can we then be positively sure that the celestial waters of chaos owed their origin to Sat- urn\u2019s nebular cloud? Of course not. It would be arrogant of me to be adamant about this. What our ancient forebears saw in the sky during this period was too indistinct for them to describe in clear detail. That much is more than obvious. All that can safely be stated is that the few snippets from the mytho-historical record we have had a chance to examine seem to fit such a model.",

As already stated, few motifs surface as often in the mytho- historical record of the entire world. Time and again, the Egyptian myths of Creation ascer- tain that, in the beginning, the creator was the only entity man remembered having seen in the sky hovering over the waters of the deep. \u201cI am Atum,\u201d the god is made to utter, \u201cwho appeared alone...rising from the waters of chaos.\u201d' The identity of Atum as Saturn need not be repeated. Neither is that of Osiris. We are thus not surprised to discover that Neb-er-tcher/Khepera/Osiris was likewise made to state: \u201cT am the creator of what hath come into being...and I came into being in primeval time...[ was alone, for they [the other deities] were not [yet] born...\u201d? Very much like those of Genesis, the Egyptian waters of chaos were said to have been enveloped in darkness. \u201cNothing existed,\u201d it is written, \u201cexcept a boundless primeval mass of water which was shrouded in darkness.\u201d* In the Pert-em-hru we even find Osiris/Saturn complaining about \u201chis life alone in darkness.\u201d* Ptah-Seker, another form of the Egyptian creator, was also lauded as \u201cthe great god, who came into being in the beginning, he who resteth upon the darkness.\u201d He was thus known inter alia as \u201cthe guardian of the darkness.\u201d Thus Wallis Budge saw Ptah-Seker as a \u201cform of Osiris, that is to say, of the night sun\u201d and that he \u201cwas originally a power of dark- ness, or of the night, which in later times was identified with forms of the night sun like Tem [i-e., Atum].\u201d\u00b0 The Qoran also preaches that Allah was on the waters when he indulged in Creation. \u201cThroned above the waters,\u201d it is there written, \u201cHe made the heavens and the earth...\u201d\u00b0",

In one Ve- dic hymn we find it stated that: \u201cDarkness there was at first by darkness hidden; without dis- tinctive marks, this all was water.\u201d\u201d Or, according to a different translation: \u201cDarkness was there, all wrapped around by darkness, and all was water indiscriminate.\u201d* Similarly, the Laws of Manu preach: \u201cThis world was darkness, unknowable, without form, beyond reason and perception, as if utterly asleep.\u201d\u201d Not only among the Hindus, but even among the lesser tribes of India, such as the Muria of the Bastar State in the Central Provinces, the same motif keeps repeating itself: \u201cWhen this world was first made, there was neither sun nor moon...and everything was dark.\u201d\u201d\u00b0 From Japan comes a similar belief which Wheeler not only recognizes as being uni- versal but also as a prototype of the Kronos/Saturn myth: \u201cIn the earliest legend with which the recital [i.e., the Kojiki] opens, one rec- ognizes the primal myth...the development from a primordial darkness and chaos...This is the Kronos legend, in its thousand forms, the father of all my- thologies, upon which so many peoples have constructed their cosmogo- nies.\u201d\"!

Others claimed that Chaos and darkness coexisted\u2014as, for instance, Aristophanes: \u201cChaos and Night and black Erebus and wide Tartarus first existed.\u201d And Orpheus is made to say: \u201cFrom the beginning the gloomy night enveloped and obscured all things that were under the ether.\u201d\"* From the cold spaces of Siberia comes a Creation myth that unfolds as a competition between Num, the demiurge, and Nga, his alter-ego. \u201cSince you claim you are stronger than I am,\u201d Num said to Nga,\u201d organize the earth.\u201d The sky, however, was already in existence and, as elsewhere, so was the primordial ocean.\u2019\u00b0",

On the water was foam. The foam moved round and round continually...After a time there is- sued from the foam a person in human form...This was Taik\u00e9-mol [Solitude Walker].

In the telling, of course, many of these myths acquired a fanciful cast and framework that sometimes borders on childish fable. But that, after all, is the nature of allegory and myth.",

In those times there dwelt there a certain people who owed allegiance to an overlord whose name they no longer remember. And they say that in those times when all was night in the land there came forth from a lake in the district called Collasuyu, a Lord named Con Ticci Viracocha...And while he was there...he suddenly made the sun and the day and commanded the sun to follow the course which it does follow...They say that this Con Ticci Viracocha had emerged on an earlier occasion and that on this first ap- pearance he made the heaven and the earth and left everything dark.\u201d*\u00b0 Similarly, an account by Sarmiento de Gamboa states that: \u201cThe natives of this country [i.e., Peru] say that in the beginning, before the world was created, there was one whom they called Viracocha. And he cre- ated the world dark and without the Sun, nor Moon, nor stars.\u201d*! \u201cThe Sun, according to Sarmiento\u2019s narrative,\u201d Jan Sammer informs us, \u201cemerged only after the Deluge.\u201d It seems, then, that even the famous Kon Tiki (Con Ticci) was none other than a Sat- urnian figure, and the \u201clake\u201d from which it was said he emerged nothing but the dim memory of the ancient waters of chaos. The description of this god as a fair-skinned, red-bearded man has captured the imagination of western chroniclers but, among the original natives, this be- lief was not unanimous.

As we have seen, it was only through creation that Janus \u201cassumed the face and members of a god.\u201d Similarly, the Egyptian creator was \u201ca formless god [who] stood alone in the \u2018waters\u2019 of the sky...a sphere without external \u2018at- tributes\u2019 or \u2018limbs\u2019.\u201d*\u00b0 Returning to Kon Tiki Viracocha, we learn that: \u201cIn all the accounts, whatever the regional variations, this hero always ap- peared as a god-creator who intervened in a world which was already cre- ated...but unorganized...Viracocha\u2019s role was therefore to transform chaos into cosmos...\u201d\u00b0> Moreover, this myth of the Collao seems to imply that the \u201cearth\u201d which existed prior to the creation, or appearance, of light was also considered a creation of Kon Tiki. This belief is not to be wondered at for it seems doubtful that man remembers a god older than the Sat- urnian figure. But it does seem that he remembers a time when the Sun was not yet apparent in the sky. Thus, another myth from the same region explicitly states: \u201cIn the most ancient times the earth was covered in darkness and there was no sun.\u201d*\u201d The Popul Vuh also relates that before the \u201cearth\u201d was created, \u201cthere was only motionless sea\u201d and \u201cit was night; si- lence stood in the dark.\u201d** And again, from a Xingu myth we learn that: \u201cIn the beginning it was all dark.

The nights would be millions in the long night to name; it was the long, wearisome night, the night of Rumia!\u201d> While this darkness was described as having been primarily in the sky, in which the creator was seen to hover, it does not seem to have restricted itself to the celestial waters. Since this darkness was said to have preceded the appearance of the Sun, as is also implied in Genesis, it would necessarily mean that the entire sky was immersed in it. Needless to say, such a darkness could not but have touched Earth and, in fact, many of the myths we have already enumerated more than intimate this. In some instances, the myths themselves actually state as much. It therefore becomes obvious that the age of darkness preceded the time when Saturn shone as a true sun. As we have seen, time and again we are told that, during this age of darkness, no Sun, no Moon, no stars were seen. It therefore seems that we are still missing something crucial. What was it that hid the Sun, the Moon, and the stars from view? Another problem that arises at this point, of course, has to do with life itself. Could life, let alone man, have existed during a protracted period during which Earth would have been immersed in darkness?",

A moment\u2019s reflection, however, should tell one that, for anything to have been visible, there must at least have been a modest amount of illumination. Even though not yet glorious as a sun, Saturn must have still shed some light. And, to be sure, the mytho-historical record is not exactly silent on this. The Book of the Secrets of Enoch describes the beginning of Creation in a somewhat fuller manner than does the Book of Genesis. It is from its pages that we learn of the uncoil- ing of Adoil as the very genesis of this process. In the quote that follows, God is describing to Enoch the manner in which he created the cosmos: \u201cI commanded in the very lowest parts that visible things should come down from invisible, and Adoil came down very great, and I beheld him, and lo! he had a belly of great light. \u201cAnd I said to him: \u2018Become undone, Adoil, and let the visible come out of thee.\u2019 \u201cAnd he became undone...\u201d! The name \u201cAdoil,\u201d also \u201cIdoil,\u201d probably derives from the Hebrew id El, that is \u201chand of God\u201d or, more appropriately, \u201chand of El,\u201d? that is Saturn. The coming undone of Adoil, meanwhile, presupposes that the planetary deity had originally been tightly coiled, which is not at odds with our hypothesized nebular cloud. Note, however, that Adoil is claimed to have had \u201ca belly of great light\u201d even before he became undone to release that light. The Eskimo entity known as Raven, whom we have already identified through the rules of comparative mythology as a representation of the Saturnian creator, was also said to have first existed in darkness. But there is something else of interest that is contained in this myth as paraphrased by Marion Wood:",

He was still small and weak and his special powers had not fully developed.\u201d? Granted that nothing is here said about Raven having contained, or emitted, any light, the fact that he was described as having still been \u201csmall and weak\u201d hints at the apparent in- effectuality of the entity involved; as so, incidentally, does the disclosure that his \u201cspecial powers had not [yet] fully developed.\u201d What this tells us is that Raven/Saturn had not yet evolved into the glorious sun of night described by other races. A tale similar to that of Adoil comes to us from South America. A. Metraux relates it in the following words: \u201cHere is the tale of creation as told by the Chibcha Indians of Colombia. When it was dark, before anything in the world existed, light was enclosed in something big, which the Muiscas called \u2018Chiminagua\u2019.\u201d* That this light of Chiminagua, like that of Adoil, was later released presupposes its pre-existence. Something similar is unequivocally stated in the Linga Purana where we read: \u201cWhen the night of Brahma born of the unmanifest reached the stage of dawn, this visible universe was one that had not been analyzed. It was still enveloped in the nocturnal darkness...[but] the self-born lord, he who achieves all the af- fairs of the worlds, moved about like a glow-worm, with a desire to mani- fest.\u201d What we are here told, then, is that not only was the universe\u2014i.e. this \u201cAll\u201d \u2014 originally in darkness, but Brahma, whom we have already identified as Saturn, radi- ated but only feebly, \u201clike a glow-worm.\u201d This is like saying that Saturn\u2019s glow was not enough to dissipate the darkness. According to the Mbay\u00e9: \u201c...the First Being [whom they called Namandui and/or the Namandu Fa- ther]...made darkness. He made the cradle of darkness...[but] he did not see [this] darkness, though the sun did not yet exist. He was lit by the reflection of his own inner self.\u201d",

The luminary radiated a diffused glow that was, however, too dim to dispel the surrounding darkness. According to Hopi legend, there definitely was light in the sky during that early age; but it was a dark light. \u201cThis,\u201d the Hopi say, \u201cwas at the time of the dark purple light, Qoy- angnuptu, the first phase of the dawn of creation...\u201d\u201d A darkness that was not total is something that we continue to experience to this day. After all, our nights are dark but, except under the most adverse conditions, never totally so. Even when the full Moon sheds its light on Earth, the night remains dark despite its silvery gleam. The Saturnian milieu we have been examining need not have been that much differ- ent. Even so, the problem remains: After all, at present, night gives way to day. But could life have survived in a dark environment that lasted for ages without the light of day? CREATURES OF THE DARK Sunlight is not essential to life per se. Microscopic bacteria are known to live in the ground, entirely bereft of light, endur- ing extreme temperatures, and thriving on a diet of metals and sulfur. Some of these mi- crobes get their energy \u201cby digesting compounds containing copper, arsenic, bismuth, molyb- denum, nickel, antimony, uranium, vanadium and zinc.\u201d As they digest this hellish banquet, the microbes excrete pools of sulfuric acid. Ever since the 1970s, this knowledge has been successfully utilized in the mining of metals by introducing such bacterial organisms which extract metals from ores by simply digesting them.\u00b0 Methane-producing microbes known as Archaea live at great marine depths in a sun- less world close to abysmal hydrothermal vents. Nor are microbes the only forms of life that cluster around these orifices. In the 1970s, scientists discovered that flues near the Galdpagos Islands support a thriving community of bacteria, tube worms, and even clams \u201cwhose pri- mary source of energy is not light but sulfur compounds emitted by the vents.\u201d\"\u00b0 Two large communities thriving in similar sites were discovered in the eastern Pa- cific, a few hundred miles from Easter Island, in May 1981 by members of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Apart from bacteria, worms, and clams, these communities also contained mussels, starfish and actual fish which were photographed at depths reaching 9,000 feet. Like the communities discovered earlier, these organisms thrive on chemical energy \u201cindependent of the heat and light from the sun that sustains most life on earth.\u201d \"'",

It\u2019s obvious to us that there must be many, many more communities in between to make it possible for these ani- mals to migrate along the ridge.\u201d\u201d In fact, it is now being theorized, but by no means universally accepted, that life it- self might very well have originated at such vents,\"* while it is giving hope to others that life might yet be discovered in the seemingly inhospitable environments known to exist on other bodies, both planets and satellites, of our Solar System.'\u00b0 As Barry Came noted, judging by the evidence of Earth\u2019s ocean bottoms, sunlight does not appear to be a prerequisite.'\u00ae In 1998, the submerged Axial Volcano rumbled into renewed life with an outpouring of lava that rose to fill an old scar a mile beneath the surface, while Axial\u2019s crater sank by an added 10 feet. Scientists working at the New Millennium Observatory, which monitors the ocean bottom some 290 miles off the Oregon coast, were offered the chance to study the drifting of continents at first hand. Submersibles, robots, and remote-controlled cameras joined forces in collecting information. Apart from the geologic implications of the undersea eruption, it also gave scientists a chance to study the ecological changes that ensued.\u2019\u201d As re- ported by Jessica Gorman: \u201cEven as lava overran old life at the bottom, jets of water squeezed out by the volcano disgorged bacteria that thrive at 220 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014hotter than household boiling water\u2014from even more searing environments below. Despite the complete lack of sunlight, bacterial colonies bloomed around Axial, feeding on volcanic chemicals like hydrogen sulfide, and tube worms arrived seemingly from nowhere. Such scenes of rebirth are probably com- mon along the 40 thousand miles of mid-ocean ridges, where the Earth\u2019s crust is torn apart.\u201d\"* Deep sea life in sunless waters, but away from deep sea vents, has actually been known to exist from much earlier than the 1970s. As Lincoln Barnett describes, in \u201cthe zone of utter blackness, animals display the brown and black shades of Melanocetus and Pho- tostomias , though a few, such as the scarlet deep-sea prawns, astonishingly wear bright col-",

To quote Rachel Carson: \u201cFor the darkness of the lower depths has forced many creatures to make their own light. Perhaps half of the fishes that live in dimly lit or darkened water, as well as many of the lower forms, are phosphorescent. Many fishes carry torches that can be turned on or off at will, presumably to help them find or pursue their prey. Others have rows of light over their bodies, in patterns that vary from species to species. This may be a sort of recognition mark or badge by which the fish can be known as friend or enemy.\u201d\u201d! Moreover: \u201cDown beyond the reach of even the longest and strongest of the sun\u2019s rays, the eyes of fishes are different. They become enlarged, as though to make the most of any chance light of whatever sort. Or they may be telescopic, large of lens, and protruding. Some fishes, on the other hand, have become blind, as has happened to certain cave animals that live in a world of darkness. To make up for their lack of eyes, the blind animals of the sea have marvelous feelers and long, slender fins. With these they grope their way like so many blind men with canes. They get their knowledge of enemies or food through the sense of touch.\u201d\u201d Sea plants do not grow at these depths so that these \u201chungry flesh-eaters prey fiercely upon each other, yet the whole community depends in the end upon the slow rain of food particles descending from above.\u201d\u201d The fierceness of the death struggles that must go on in this Stygian gloom \u201cis seen in the saber-toothed jaws of some of the small, dragonlike fishes of the deeper waters, in the immense mouths, and in the elastic bodies that make it possible for a fish to swallow another several times its size [where] pressure and darkness are the conditions of life...\u201d Sulfur-sustained life is found not only around deep sea vents, but also up on land, out of the sea, in caverns as dark as the oceans\u2019 abysmal depths.

We see it at the midocean ridges, and there are some hot springs. But this is an almost unique opportunity to study a com- plex ecosystem in a readily available site\u2014where there\u2019s no light coming in and yet we have a complex menagerie of organisms.\u201d\u201d\u00ae Actually, the propensity of varied organisms that live entombed within Earth\u2019s cav- ers has been known and studied for far longer than Hose inadvertently intimates. Blind cave fish have been known since 1938;7\u2019 cave-dwelling salamanders since 1689.\u201d Not only do such creatures live in total darkness, light itself becomes a hazard\u2014as proven by eye-less millipedes which curl up in frantic efforts to avoid artificially introduced beams of light.\u201d As Donald Jackson could already write in 1982: \u201cBeneath the shroud of eternal darkness [that exists \u2018deep within the under- world\u2019], no green plants\u2014the basis of the food chain for most creatures\u2014can grow. The environment could hardly seem less hospitable to life. And yet, astonishingly, animals can thrive in the caverns of the earth. Unseen, unheard, they creep and crawl, slither and scuttle, swim and fly, endlessly questing for the means of survival. In their marvelous physical adaptations, in the senses they use to navigate the perpetual night of a rockbound realm, in their extraor- dinary behavior and reproductive patterns, they offer a microscopic study of evolution.\u201d None of these creatures of darkness are mammals, the class of animals to which man belongs. But consider the bat, many species of which spend their daylight hours hanging to- gether upside down in the recesses of darkened caves. When they venture outside, it is at night\u2014from total darkness to a lesser gloom. Their sonic ability allows them to navigate the caliginous corridors, often sinuous, as well as they do outside at night. Had they been blind, they would have been able to maneuver just as well. For all they require, the world outside could just as well be totally dark. They would survive.

Man, too, is an adaptable animal, and there is no way anyone can tell whether he would have been able to adapt to an environment of total darkness. But this, after all, is merely academic, since it has not been proposed, let alone claimed, that the Saturnian age of darkness was one of totality. All that the above implies is that sunshine is not, and never has been, a prerequisite for life. At present, man survives in an environment bathed in sunshine. But sunshine, in the end, is only starlight. And the brown dwarf star that once was Saturn would have bathed man in a similar, even if dimmer, light. Unlike the blind creatures of dark caves and abysmal depths, man cannot survive on a diet of sulfur or metallic ingredients. Besides, as we have seen, some of the oceanic denizens we have just scrutinized depend on a rain of organic particles falling from above. Man had no such manna to nourish him. It is doubtful that, at this early stage of his career as a human he could have sustained himself solely on the flesh of other animals. And, in any 290",

The problem then becomes one of photosynthesis PHOTOSYNTHESIS The intricacies of the photosynthetic conversion is too complex to be reviewed in any detail here. Suffice it to say that photosynthesis is the process by which plants harness the energy of sunlight which is absorbed by the chlorophyll contained in their make-up. It has often been stated that, directly or indirectly, the entire organic food-chain required to sustain all plants and animals depends on the photosynthetic process. As we have already seen above, this does not hold for sulfur-ingesting bacterial organisms or those that survive by di- gesting metallic constituents. It does, however, seem to hold for all forms of higher life. Because the primitive Earth\u2014Saturn or no Saturn\u2014would necessarily have been en- tirely different from the way it is at present, biologists had come to the conclusion that the photosynthetic process, whose sole support is chlorophyll, could not itself have been prime- val.

As is well known, certain plants can grow in extreme environments, as in the Arctic regions, while others have adapted themselves to grow only in the tropics. And yet, the chemistry of photosynthesis is identical in all these plants. What actually transpires is that photosynthesis proceeds at a rate that is directly proportional to the incident radiation in which the light energy is utilized with the greatest efficiency. Moreover, it has been calcu- lated that only about one to three percent of the light falling on any plant is actually trans- formed into chemical energy. Most of the Sun\u2019s radiation falling on a plant is lost through reflection and ineffective absorption by pigments other than chlorophyll (or, at least, other than those pigments in the chloroplasts). How does all this affect our progressing theoretical construct? Well, for one thing, Sunlight being starlight, photosynthesis would have been able to occur just as well under the light shed by the brown dwarf star that once was Saturn. Its dimmer light would have been compensated for by the plants\u2019 ability to control absorption in proportion to the incident radiation falling upon them. Equally significant to our study is the fact that red light is the most important spec- trum necessary for the growing of plants.\u201d' Brown dwarf stars are known to radiate a propen- sity of red light. Thus, the spectrum of received light on Earth during the Saturnian period would have been much redder than at present and, therefore, more conducive to plant growth. The brown dwarf star that was Saturn would have also radiated ultraviolet light.\u201d But then so does the Sun. Ultraviolet rays are normally considered relatively harmless and even beneficial. Long-term exposure to high concentrations of these rays can, however, also prove harmful. We have no way of knowing how highly concentrated the ultraviolet rays from Sat- urn would have been. Since, even at its best, the Saturnian sun was feebler than the Sun, it is quite possible that its ultraviolet radiation would also have been feebler. During the age of semi-darkness with which we are presently concerned, when Saturn had not yet flared up as a true sun, its entire radiation might have been feebler still. In the meantime, it has been found that mosses in the Antarctic region are able to produce certain compounds which act to pro- tect them against excessive ultraviolet radiation.* Who is to say that other plants might not have derived the same ability during the Saturnian era of semi-darkness had our brown dwarf primary radiated excessive ultraviolet rays? THE REQUIRED TEMPERATURE Light and photosynthesis, however, are not the only requirements for the subsistence of plants and animals. Life also requires heat, at least warmth\u2014or so we used to think. As it",

In 1989, Michael Tennesen could report that: \u201cIn the 1960s the interior of Antarctica was declared a lifeless zone. But sci- entists have since discovered a rich array of organisms tucked away in isolated habitats. Robert Wharton, a biologist at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, has found life at the bottom of perpetually frozen lakes in an area of wind- swept, snowless valleys.\u201d*\u00b0 Lake Hoare, situated in a mountainous region 800 miles from the South Pole, is cov- ered by a 20-foot thick sheet of ice, the mean surface temperature of which reaches 4 below zero. And yet, colorful algae-like organisms manage to survive underneath the lake\u2019s icy crust. As Wharton himself declared: \u201c[These algae-like organisms are] a fairly advanced form of life. You\u2019ve got a cell wall, and you\u2019ve got DNA inside the cell that is able to reproduce and pass on information to its offspring. It\u2019s not elephants, but it\u2019s a big step in the evolution of biology.\u201d*\u00b0 Or, as Chris McKay succinctly phrased it, even in permanent subfreezing conditions, \u201clife can persist much longer than we\u2019d thought.\u201d\u201d\u201d True, as Wharton admitted, these algae-like organisms are not elephants\u2014and a far cry from land plants and animals, to say nothing about humans. But, as in the case of those creatures that are able to exist in total darkness, the above serves to illustrate that generalities can often be deceiving. An adaptation to cold is not called for in the primeval Saturnian environment we are attempting to reconstruct. As we have already seen in Chapter 5, even at present, Saturn radi- ates more heat than it receives from the Sun. We saw there that, while Jupiter\u2019s excessive heat is accepted as a residue from the planet\u2019s formative period, most of Saturn\u2019s had been relegated to kinetic energy released by the circulation of dissolved helium. But when Voy- ager 1 flew past Saturn in late 1980, it failed to uncover such evidence. As reported by Dennis Overbye: \u201cPioneer 11 had found that Saturn radiates almost three times as much energy as it receives from the sun. Some scientists had suggested that the helium might be settling deeper inside Saturn\u2019s atmosphere than the hydrogen, re- leasing gravitational energy in the form of \u2018helium rain.\u2019 But this would leave Saturn\u2019s outer layers relatively deficient in helium, and Voyager found that this was not the case.\u201d**",

While this work has nothing to say for or against this proposition, some of Lovelock\u2019s insights are germane to our subject. \u201cFor example, [according to orthodoxy] we know that when the solar system was formed the sun was dim and that it has heated up ever since. Yet Earth wasn\u2019t too cold for life in the beginning, and it isn\u2019t too hot for life now.\u201d\u201d While Lovelock gives his own reasons for this, the belief that the Sun was much weaker in Earth\u2019s dim past has now gained acceptance. In analyzing the problems of climate thought to be inherent during the Archaean era\u20143.8 to 2.5 billion years ago\u2014Gregory Jen- kins speaks of an environment that \u201cwas very warm with a sun that is much cooler than to- day\u2019s.\u201d*' Geological evidence indicates that this trend continued into the early Precambrian period during which \u201cEarth was much warmer...than it is today, despite a weaker sun.\u201d\u201d Billions and millions of years are far removed from the Saturnian era with which we are concerned. The point I wish to stress, however, is that even as per orthodox belief, life on Earth does not seem to have required abundant heat from the Sun. We notice, for instance, that the reconstructions of primeval plants by paleobotanists, who are guided in their recon- structions by fossils found in coal and other deposits, end up showing some rather tall speci- mens exhibiting sparse crowns of foliage. Such a study, for instance, was recently conducted on specimens recovered from the coal seams of the American Midwest and Ohio Valley, which are believed to have been laid down by vast swamps which once stretched from Mis- souri to Pennsylvania. The lycopods, forty-five to ninety feet tall,\u201d that were reconstructed from these remains have all the appearance of trees which seem to be straining their trunks in order to reach a feeble light, just as some plants do when grown in a dimly-lit terrarium that is kept in a darkened room.\u201d Thus, for instance, when the succulent popularly known as hens-and-chickens, which usually grows relatively flat to the ground, is grown in such a ter- rarium, it tends to stretch tall and spindly with its fleshy leaves growing in an open and loose spiral until it either reaches the light or bends and breaks under its own weight.\u201d As paleobotanists from the University of Illinois who studied the remains of lycopods ascertained: \u201cPlant life was quite different then; most plants had no seeds, and flowers had not yet made their appearance.\u201d True, these trees are supposed to have thrived three",

(Photosynthesis manifested itself in blue-green al- gae at the end of the pre-Cambrian era some 200 million years ago\u201d \u2014although this figure varies from one authority to another.) The reconstruction of such trees, as also earlier and more primitive ones, together with vistas of the environmental terrain that sustained them, had been going on much earlier than the Illinois University experiment. Dated to the late Silurian and all through the Devo- nian periods (c. 325-280 million years ago), the first land-based plants all exhibited the same spindly character with sparse verdant crowns which, like the lycopod trees, give the impres- sion that they all had to struggle for whatever available dim light there was to nourish them. And while plant life continued to evolve and spread from the Paleozoic to the Mesozoic eras, from the Devonian through the Jurassic and end of the Cretaceous periods, they were still spindly specimens struggling to reach the light.* It was not until the age of mammals, pre- dominantly during the Paleocene period, that the land became engulfed in a verdant profu- sion of subtropical plants. None of this is to say that the plants of the Quaternary era, which saw the advent of man, and which is, therefore, the era with which we are concerned, were anything like those of the pre-Cambrian down to the Cretaceous. But several things need to be pointed out here, not the least of which being the fact that photosynthesis works just as well under conditions other than those existing in the present world. (Of photoperiodicity we will speak in a following chapter.) Moreover, and what is more important to our study, is that if life could have originated under a dim cold Sun, to say nothing of the constant volcanic outpourings which are believed to have clouded the sky through most of Earth\u2019s primeval eras, it could certainly have originated and thrived under a dim, but warmer, brown dwarf star. Which brings me to ask: Has it ever occurred to anyone that the sun which bathed Earth with its radiance during its past geologic eras might not have been our present one? THE PLASMASPHERE The problem we now face is this: With Saturn stationed above Earth\u2019s north celestial pole, and the Sun still somehow absent, how could the world have received uniform radia- tion? How could Earth\u2019s southern hemisphere been bathed in light and heat when it would have been entirely shielded from the north-radiating brown dwarf star that was Saturn? These are questions that have intrigued various other researchers. Prime among them, back in 1980, was Roger Ashton. What he finally settled upon was a shell of gas and dust, or bubble, within the hollow of which the Saturn-Earth system would have abided. The interior surface of this shell, according to Ashton, would have reflected back Saturn\u2019s radiation to-",

What Ashton did not know was that, for different reasons, Ralph Juergens had already proposed such a plasma sheath four years earlier. \u201cPresumably,\u201d Juergens had written, \u201cboth [Saturn and Earth] would be enveloped in a common magnetosphere which... would equate with a sheath between the solar-wind plasma and any material body, or closely coupled sys- tems of bodies, at non-plasma potential.\u201d At this point, some of my lay readers may want to know: What is a plasma? Common examples of plasma are what is created in neon tubes and in the brilliant arc of an arc-welder. At its simplest, to quote Wallace Thornhill, it \u201cis an ionized gas in which the atoms or molecules have been stripped of their electrons, allowing both positive and negative charges to move independently.\u201d There are those who deny that plasma is itself a gas, call- ing it instead a fourth state of matter which often behaves like a gas, but which conducts electricity and is affected by magnetic fields. There was a time, not so long ago, when astrophysicists had close to no use for electric- ity, let alone plasmas, in astronomy. But by 1999, Dennis Gallagher, a plasma physicist at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center, could claim that \u201c99.9 percent of the Universe is made up of plasma.\u201d\u2122 All of a sudden, astronomers started talking about near-Earth plasma environment, plasmaspheres, plasma convections, and their associated Birkeland currents.\u201d Plasma, however, is one thing; a plasma sheath or bubble is another. And yet, according to Thornhill, one characteristic of plasmas is that they tend to shield bodies embedded in them by creating what is known as a Langmuir sheath around them.* By 1997, even Talbott had jumped on this band-wagon, opting for a more extensive and encasing atmospheric shroud around the Saturnian system we have been reconstructing. As he explained: \u201cThere are many indications that the [Saturnian] planetary configuration ini- tially moved through a gas cloud or envelope preventing any sharp contrast of light and",

As Talbott reported: \u201cI should mention here that, ac- cording to Wal Thornhill, it is possible that in the more electrically active phases the entire configuration may have moved within a [plasma] discharge sheath\u2014something that would not preclude general illumination by the Sun, but could have kept the illumination diffuse.\u201d* In his own work, that same year, Thornhill described the \u201c[Saturnian] planetary group\u201d as having been \u201cinside a gigantic cometary coma.\u201d\u201d Three years later, Thornhill restated his conviction when he wrote that, in his opinion, Earth orbited in the anode dark space beneath the chromosphere of the brown dwarf that was proto-Saturn.\u201d \u201cEarth situated inside the spherical envelope of such a star radiating according to the usual inverse square law, would find the energy influx almost equal over the entire planet. Such an arrangement is far more benign toward life than at present where the energy source, the Sun, subtends a small angle in the sky.\u201d Brown dwarf stars, to which we had compared both Saturn and Jupiter in an earlier chapter, had by then been discovered in quantity. In our neighborhood alone, it has been stated, there may be more brown dwarfs than Sun-like stars.\u201d Some of these have been cal- culated to be one-tenth the size of the Sun with a temperature rising no more than 950\u00b0 K. In answer to the question whether living entities, including man, would have been able to breathe the constituents of Saturn\u2019s brown dwarf atmosphere, Thornhill replied with the words: \u201cWe are [presently] nestled in the Sun\u2019s atmosphere without it causing us any prob- lems. Proto-Saturn\u2019s envelope would have been more dense but still a good approxi- mate to a vacuum. The constituents of the atmosphere of brown dwarf stars, so far as they have been determined, seem to include water molecules and others helpful to life.\u201d\u00ae What did Thornhill mean by stating that we are presently nestled within the Sun\u2019s atmos- phere. As Gary Zank plainly puts it: \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded by hot gas.\u201d And whence this gas? Zank explains: \u201cAs our sun moves through extremely \u2018empty\u2019 or low-density interstellar space, the solar wind produces a protective bubble\u2014the heliosphere around our solar system, which allows life to flourish on Earth...Without the heliosphere, neutral hydrogen would interact with our atmosphere, possibly producing catastrophic climate changes,",

It is this heliosphere\u2014this \u201cbreathing bubble\u201d as it is now being called\u2014that acts as a \u201ccocoon\u201d which \u201callows life to flourish on earth.\u201d What all this amounts to is that Earth resides within the Sun\u2019s heliosphere, just as Ashton and Thornhill suppose it once resided in proto-Saturn\u2019s plasma sheath, a hypothesis that can no longer be dismissed as far-fetched. As Thornhill explained further: \u201cThe astronomer [William] Herschel believed that people inhabited the Sun beneath its shining clouds. We now know that is a crazy idea. But would it be so crazy if the Sun were a brown dwarf star? To a close observer, proto-Saturn would have looked like a dim red star. Red giants have immense, very low density envelopes. If Betel- geuse were to replace the Sun, it would encompass all of the planets out as far as Ju- piter! Astronomers accept the idea that planets could orbit within the thin envelope of such stars.\u201d \u201cAnother interesting consequence is that all objects orbiting in that region would re- ceive the same energy per unit area of their surface. The spectrum of the light would have been much redder than at present...\u201d True, as already noted, Earth\u2019s primordial star would have been feebler than our present Sun, but this would have been compensated for by Earth\u2019s proximity to proto-Saturn which would have involved a stretch that was much shorter than its present distance from the Sun, to say nothing of the redder spectrum of light in which it would have been bathed. But could Saturn\u2019s plasmasphere have existed within the Sun\u2019s heliosphere which is itself nothing but a plasmasphere? Can a plasmasphere exist within another? As already noted, our world itself is now being spoken of as being in a \u201cnear-Earth plasma environment.\u201d\u201d What does this mean?",

        "main_text": "It was in 1962, due to Mariner 2, that the interplanetary medium was found not to be a near-vacuum as previously believed. Instead, this medium was found to consist of plasma. But, even then, the full implication of this discovery was not immediately understood. As Ralph Juergens, writing in 1972, noted: \u201cOne of the primary characteristics of a plasma has up to now received little or no at- tention from astronomers. This is its ability to shield itself from the electric field of any body in contact with it, or contained within it, and charged to an electric potential different from that of the plasma itself. The mechanism by which such shielding is accomplished was named the space-charge sheath by those who first studied the phe- nomenon.\u201d\u201d And: \u201cBy the same sort of analysis, I would conclude that the earth has a potential not quite in keeping with its space environment, and that it therefore is surrounded by a space charge sheath. For the same reasons that a comet\u2019s sheath is elongated away from the sun, I would suppose that the earth\u2019s sheath has a tail; in other words, I would equate the terrestrial sheath with the earth\u2019s so-called magnetosphere.\u201d So, also, Wallace Thornhill who, during one of the question periods at the Society for Interdisciplinary Studies\u2019 Silver Jubilee in September 1999, made reference to \u201cEarth\u2019s windsock-like envelope\u201d usually referred to as its \u201cmagnetotail.\u201d As he there pointed out: \u201cIn Juergens\u2019 view it is a plasma sheath...\u201d By the turn of the century, astrophysicists themselves were speaking of plasmaspheres around the bodies of the Solar System as if they had always known about them. Venus, it was discovered, possessed a plasmasphere in the form of a cometary tail that spread close enough to \u201ctickle the Earth when the two planets are in line with the Sun.\u201d\u201d Jupiter, too, is now known to be surrounded by a plasma sheet which, like the Sun\u2019s electrical current sheet, lies along Jupiter\u2019s magnetic equator.\u201d So, similarly, with Saturn. As Thornhill noted, had Sat- urn\u2019s plasma sheath been visible in the sky, it would make the planet appear as a distinct disc instead of the mere pin-point of light we see in the night sky.\u201d Eventually, Earth\u2019s own plasmasphere, which has been calculated to extend at least 12,000 miles into space, was even \u201cphotographed.\u201d",

It is thus obvious that plasmaspheres are contained within larger plasmaspheres since the planetary plasmaspheres within our Solar System are all contained with that of the Sun. There is therefore nothing unusual about our posited Saturnian system having been en- cased within a plasmasphere as hypothesized by Ashton in 1980. On the contrary, the theory not only fits current astrophysical reality, it is actually demanded by it. All of the plasmaspheres within the Solar System, however, are transparent and, as such, are not able to reflect radiation back toward the primary around which they are wrapped. As already noted, Ashton had theorized that the plasmasphere surrounding our posited Saturnian system would have had to have been opaque. But can a plasmasphere be opaque? The answer is that it can. As Anthony Peratt, one of the foremost plasma physicists alive today, has stated, a \u201cplasma cloud...indeed can vary between transparent and opaque at different wave- lengths.\u201d So in that, also, we seem to be on the right track. SIXTH INTERLUDE In the meantime, before moving to the next phase of our reconstruction, which will help us to unearth more of the evidence we are looking for, it behooves us to recapitulate what we have learned in these last three chapters. It also allows us to expand our list of theses which, in keeping with the chronological sequence of events, will now have to be reshuffled and re- numbered. Hypothesis #1: That, from what can be deduced from ancient as well as primitive astro- nomical lore, Earth had once been a satellite of the planet Saturn, originally a brown dwarf star, which, because of its proximity, loomed large in the sky as a distinct disc larger than the apparent size of the full Moon. Hypothesis #2: That, still according to ancient astronomical lore, during this indetermi- nate period, Saturn was the only visible celestial body in Earth\u2019s primordial sky. Hypothesis #3: That, as seen from Earth, the Saturnian sun did not rise and/or set, but remained visibly immobile at all times. Hypothesis #4: That Saturn\u2019s immobility was due to the fact that Earth was stationed di- rectly \u201cbeneath\u201d Saturn\u2019s south pole and that, from Earth, Saturn therefore appeared to be permanently fixed in the north celestial sphere, the very place now occupied by the Pole Star. What this also means is that Saturn and Earth were linearly aligned with the both of them sharing the same axis of rotation.",

Hypothesis #6: That, according to some of man\u2019s earliest memories, Earth was originally engulfed in what our ancestors persistently referred to as darkness. This was an age which, despite its remoteness in time, ended up etching itself indelibly in human consciousness. It was a time during which the Sun, the Moon, and the stars were not yet visible in the sky. Sat- urn ruled alone. Hypothesis #7: This age, we have also found out, could not have been one of total dark- ness, and that, in fact, mankind itself remembers that the Saturnian deity actually shed a feeble light. The terrestrial environment during this age was bathed in a perpetual twilight or, rather, a protracted dawn, which man remembered as the dawn of Creation. Hypothesis #8: That, during this period, a nebulous entity, which our ancestors had diffi- culty in describing clearly, surrounded the Saturnian primary. We have conjectured this en- tity to have been a placental cloud, or circumstellar disk, surrounding the Saturnian orb. This entity seems to have been that to which the ancients alluded to as Chaos. Hypothesis #9: During this same unspecified period, the Saturnian orb was seen to float over an apparition which, to ancient man, looked like water, a cosmic ocean. This \u201cwater\u201d was probably the same nebular disk which, spinning slowly, would have had the appearance of a celestial whirlpool. Hypothesis #10: That, at some later time, Saturn shone much brighter than it had previ- ously done, bright enough for ancient man to allude to it consistently as a sun. Hypothesis #11: That this primordial Saturnian sun shone during that time we today call the night. One thing to keep in mind is that ancient man could only describe what he had witnessed in the sky. Our ancient forefathers could not, however, tell what the cause of any of it was. It is even doubtful that they thought about it or even cared. To them, whatever it was they saw was simply there. Unlike our present Sun, proto-Saturn did not rise or set. It did not move. It just sat there, doing nothing. It offered them no harm. It had always been there. They had al- ways remembered it. They would have taken it for granted. There is, however, one discordant note concerning all this. As it is now becoming in- creasingly clear, there is \u201ca dearth of brown dwarfs in close orbits around Sun-like stars\u201d\u201d \u2014which means that the chances of our Sun having had a brown dwarf in orbit around it is pretty slim. It therefore seems we are not yet out of the woods.",

With a dim Saturnian orb embedded within an indistinct nebulosity perpetually suspended overhead, and with the Sun, the Moon, and the stars still apparently absent from the sky\u2014in other words, without the succession of day and night\u2014there would have been nothing on which ancient man could have focused that would have enabled him to calculate the passage of time. This, then, presents us with yet another opportunity to test the internal consistency of the mytho-historical record because, if the above surmise is correct, our theory demands that the record should have something to say about the subject. If man could not tell time, he would have known nothing about it. The idea of a day, a month, or a year would have meant nothing to him. The concept of time would not even have occurred to him. But since, at some point, man was given the means by which he was able to calculate the passage of time, he would have remembered the previous timeless era. It is therefore inconceivable that he would not have left a record of this earlier situation. Does man\u2019s collective memory have anything to say about any of this? Can this demand be met? In this connection, as in many others, ancient man did not mince words. Not only did he leave us records of a timeless era and of an age when time began, he inexorably tied it all with the Saturnian deity and his planet. The Satapatha Brahmana, for instance, unequivo- cally speaks of a time when the year \u201cwas not then in existence.\u201d\u2019 And that the year was con- nected with our Saturnian deity can be inferred from the Ugaritic pantheon where we find El, \u201cthe creator of created things,\u201d also alluded to as \u201cthe father of the years.\u201d\u201d In Egypt, too, Ra was made to utter: \u201cI am the maker of hours, the creator of days, I am the opener of the festi- vals of the year.\u201d? Not only the year but, according to the ancients, time itself was not. As the Malay Charmbook, in its inimitable mixture of Muslim and pagan doctrines, has it stated:",

Meanwhile, Macrobius also tells us that: \u201c...they [i.e., the ancients] conclude that, when there was chaos, no time existed, in- sofar as time is a fixed measure derived from the revolution of the sky.

Arthur Cook, commenting on the Philadelphians\u2019 identification of Janus with Kro- nos/Saturnus, for instance, has it that: \u201cThe confusion of Ianus [the same as Janus] with Kro- nos no doubt presupposes the usual blunder Kronos = Chronos, which from the fifth century B.C. onwards queered the course of Greek theology.\u201d\u00b0 The identification of Janus as Kronos, however, is not due to confusion anymore than the equation of Kronos with Chronos is due to a blunder. As William Heidel had earlier noted: \u201cTt is not for naught that Pherecydes identified Cronus [the same as Kronos] with Chronos (Time), whose cycle is defined by the year...The myths and festivals of Cronus-Saturn prove beyond a doubt that he was associated with the turn of the year...for the myth of the Golden Age, which coincided with the beginnings of man- kind...is connected with the reign of Cronus-Saturn...In keeping with this fact is the recognized association of Saturn with Janus.\u201d This view has more recently been echoed by Livio Stecchini: \u201cIt is true that for a person who consults a dictionary the name Kronos is different from the Greek term chronos, meaning \u2018time\u2019; but there is no difference to a person",

This association is as old as the first Greek speculations on the nature of time in the preceding early period of Greek cul- ture.\u201d\u00ae So, similarly, with the Italic god Saturnus, as Cicero informs us: \u201cSaturnus was chosen as the one to have as his province the intervals and cycles of time. In Greek this god is called by the very word time, since Kronos is the same as chronos, that is, time. We call him Saturnus because he saturates himself with years.\u201d\u201d Stecchini goes on with: \u201cThe etymological connection of the two words Kronos and chronos has been positively affirmed by some linguists and strongly denied by others, because, on the one hand, the semantic similarity of the two words is evident and, on the other, from a technical linguistic point of view, the difference between K and ch is most significant.\u201d'\u00b0 AION As for Janus himself, Lydus informs us that he was by some considered the father of Aion and, by others, Aion\u2019s very self.'' But Aion, who was the god of time which gave us the English word \u201ceon,\u201d was that \u201cunlimited order\u201d held as an \u201cindestructible bond\u201d by Kronos, who was Saturn.\u2019 More than that, Aion has been directly identified as Saturn.\u2019 As the god of time, Janus was made to preside over the first day of the month, and the first month of the year, which month, in fact, was named after him\u2014Januarius, i.e., January.\" In time, and for reasons we shall soon see, he even became the god of the seasons.'* The association of Saturn with time, meanwhile, does not rest on the fallacious etymo- logical equation of Kronos with Chronos, as Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend eventually pointed out when they stated that: \u201cIt is not hidden from us that the indestructible laws of philology do not allow for the identification of Kronos and Chronos, although in Greece to do so \u2018was customary at",

        "main_text": "In the Atharva Veda it is stated that: \u201cTime is the lord of all, who was the father of Praja- pati\u201d but also that \u201ctime in the beginning [is or was] Prajapati.\u201d\u201d\u2019 That Prajapati is to be iden- tified as Saturn need not be repeated. The Satapatha Brahmana tells us that \u201cVaishva- nara...truly is the year, and Prajapati is the year.\u201d In fact, Prajapati is alluded to as \u201cthe year\u201d in numerous passages of the same work. There, Varuna, whom we have also identified as Saturn, is also referred to as \u201cthe year.\u201d Meanwhile, we have already seen Vishnu, whom we have also equated with Saturn, being lauded as Mahakala, which name we have translated as \u201cGreat Saturn.\u201d But, seeing as Kala also means Time, the same epithet can be translated as \u201cGreat Time.\u201d\u201d The result is the same because, as all the above should have in- dicated by now, as far as the ancients were concerned, the god and planet Saturn was syn- onymous with time. Thus Iranian Time was also personified as Zurvan,\u201d\u2019 whose Saturnian identity, as we have already seen, is well attested.\u201d According to the Atharva Veda, Kala, who was both Time and the planet Saturn, was considered the very first god, which is in keeping with our thesis. As we had also seen in an earlier chapter, Dhruva, the Pole star, had also been an earlier name of Saturn and, as such, the word dhruva came to have the meanings of \u201ctime,\u201d \u201cepoch,\u201d and/or \u201cera.\u201d THE SLOW-MOVING PLANET The association of time with the planet Saturn could not, of course, have eluded mytholo- gists and, in seeking an explanation, they naturally appealed to logic. Back in 1875, Gustave Schlegel, citing Dupuis, justified the phenomenon by referring to the planet\u2019s present lagging orbital pace: \u201cThe planet, with its slow and heavy walk, imitating age, drags itself along its path, in a manner of speaking; before finishing its revolution, it would have seen a great num- ber of men die whom it had seen born, so slow was its pace...He [i.e., Saturn] was the father of the years and the centuries...his was the longest measure of time which na- ture seemed to give for a single revolution of one of the celestial bodies or one of the moving stars. Is it not, therefore, natural to believe that the Ancients, who had attrib- uted to each star its domain and its function in Nature, should have given to the planet Saturn the supervision of the celestial movements which regulate the length of the years and the centuries?\u201d 2 Ibid., X1X:53:8-10 (emphasis added). ?8 Satapatha Brahmana V:2:5:14. 2 Tbid., 1V:1:4:10. 3\u00b0 VS.

        "main_text": "Stecchini, on the other hand, reversed the process by assuming that it was \u201cbecause of Kronos\u2019s association with time that his name was given to the most distant of the seven heavenly bodies...because it concludes its orbit in 30 years, so that a day in its year corre- sponds to a month in the earth\u2019s year.\u201d Saturn\u2019s slow motion along its orbit, however, does not explain why the planet was also chosen to represent the year. If any celestial body can presently claim the right to represent the year, it surely would have to be the Sun. As an indicator of the passage of time, it remains supreme. Even the Moon would have been a better indicator with which to gauge the pro- gress of time. Moreover, our ancient forebears, living in this primeval era, would hardly have even noticed the planet Satur if it then appeared, like now, as nothing but a pin-point of light in the night sky. More importantly, Dupuis\u2019, or Schlegel\u2019s, as also Stecchini\u2019s, exposi- tions do not explain what Saturn, even as Time personified, had to do with Creation. Besides, why would the slowness of the planet Saturn have led ancient man to believe in an era when time was not? As we have indicated in earlier pages, and as we shall show more fully in a sequel vol- ume, it was the Saturnian deity who was held responsible for the Creation. But, in an Iranian Rivayat, this role is bestowed on Time. \u201cTime is both Creator and the Lord of Creation which it created,\u201d it is there stated.\u201d This is paralleled by the Atharva Veda which states that \u201cTime created the earth...\u201d** A curious passage concerning Creation in a Hindu Brahmana brings various elements together: \u201cThen the seed [of Creation] became a year. Before that time there was no year.\u201d Thus, despite the fact that the waters of chaos were said to have been born of Time, as we have seen above, the reverse was just as true. As it was said, the waters of chaos themselves produced the year, \u201cthe ordainer of the days and nights.\u201c We also have it from the Maitri Upanishad that \u201cthe year, verily, is Prajapati [that is Saturn, who] is Time.\u201d What all this intimates is that what Hindu sources term as \u201cthe year\u201d is a synonym for \u201ctime.\u201d This synonymy is also apparent in Hebrew where yom (or yowm), which is normally taken to mean \u201cday,\u201d has the additional meaning of \u201cyear\u201d but also \u201ctime.\u201d So, similarly, in Egypt. The word thera, which means \u201cyear,\u201d also means \u201ctime.\u201d Thus Ptah, whom we have already seen identified as Saturn, was called \u201cthe Lord of the Year,\u201d whereas Atum, his al- ter-ego, was called \u201cthe Lord of Time.\u201d The two epithets are synonymous.",

        "main_text": "DIONYSUS In an our first chapter we saw Dionysus as the original impetus behind Greek drama. But who was this god? The mythology of Dionysus presents him as a rambunctious conqueror who spread ter- ror, as well as civilization, to the (known) world. Wherever he went, he introduced the grape vine and, with it, the fermentation of wine. In this respect he was similar to the Egyptian Osiris/Saturn who also traveled the (known) world, bringing civilization to the countries he visited, as so did other Saturnian deities. Eusebius Pamphili (c. 260-340 A. D.) already knew that the Greek Dionysus was the equivalent of the Egyptian Osiris. He knew about this equation from Plutarch (c. 46-120 A. D.)\u201d and the even earlier Herodotus who lived in the 5th century B.C.* The similarity be- tween Dionysus and Osiris, moreover, did not merely concern their histories as civilizers, but even their rites. This was so much so that Herodotus was driven to claim that the rites of Di- onysus could only have been borrowed by the Greeks from the Egyptians.\u201d These similari- ties, however, are not restricted to Dionysus and Osiris, but are common to various other Saturnian deities. (There is also some indication that, in some quarters, Dionysus was identi- fied as an alter-ego of Helios\u00ae who, as we have already seen, was the original Greek name of the planet Saturn.) The association of time with Saturn explains why the much later festivals of the New Year, touched upon briefly in preceding pages, were devoted to Saturn in his many guises. We should therefore not be surprised to find that among these festivals were those held in honor of Dionysus, who is not only identifiable as the Saturnalian king,\u201d but also directly as the Saturnian deity.\u201d It was not, therefore, spurious of William Heidel to note the obvious connection of Dionysus with Aion.\u00ae As Marija Gimbutas informed her readers: \u201cIn these festivals, which have assimilated elements of deep antiquity, Dionysus appears as a year- god.\u201d QUETZALCOATL UNVEILED The Aztec deity Quetzalcoatl, known to the previous Maya as Kukulkan, has been identified by various authorities as different celestial, and non-celestial, entities: as the Sun;*",

Jill Abery, on the other hand, was not quite happy with this identification or with any of the others mentioned above\u2014and rightly so. As she opined: \u201cQuetzalcoatl is a very ancient god with a multiple of aspects. As the feathered ser- pent, readers of Velikovsky will have no difficulty in identifying him as Venus in cometary garb. But beyond this he is the Lord of healing, learning, beauty, creativity and vegetation. He was a benefactor who brought to men the use of metals and the arts of government; who ruled in an age of perfumed, melodious plenty which can be regarded as the Golden Age of Mesoamerica...It would [therefore] appear that Quet- zalcoatl was originally the Mesoamerican equivalent of Osiris or Saturn.\u201d Would that mainstream mythologists had been as astute. Abery, of course, was not the first to ferret out the true identity of Quetzalcoatl,\u201d but I mention her especially because her intuition exemplifies what can be gleaned by a mind which is not constrained by orthodox views. What has confused the issue, and many a mythologist, is the Mesoamerican belief that when Quetzalcoatl died, his heart flew up and turned into the Morning Star,\u00ae which star has been usually understood as Venus when it appears in the morning\u00ae\u2014an event that, as we have seen on an earlier page, is duplicated in the mythology of the Egyptian Osiris/Saturn. What mythologists and archaeoastronomers seem to forget is that it was the heart of Quetzalcoatl, and not Quetzalcoatl himself, which turned into the Morning Star. Quetzalcoatl and the Morning Star were thus two entirely different entities. Let me now state that nowhere in Mesoamerican lore is Quetzalcoatl identified as Saturn. If this identification is to hold, it must do so on the evidence offered by comparative mythology. Like the Saturnian deity of other nations, Quetzalcoatl was considered as the creator.\u201d Like the Saturnian deity of other nations, as Abery indicated, Quetzalcoatl was also a civilizer.\u201d As in the Saturnian myths of other nations, Quetzalcoatl was the original one and only god.

Among these aspects is the deity\u2019s other name of Huehueteotl, which means \u201cthe old god\u201d and/or \u201cthe old god of the centre\u201d; his being revered as \u201cthe sun of the centre\u201d and \u201cthe central fire\u201d; his be- ing described as the pivot of the turning heavens; and his identification with the celestial pole. We can now add one more Saturnian characteristic of this god: Like the Greek Diony- sus, he was also lauded as the year-lord.\u2122 Leaving Central America, we travel briefly to China where we learn that the chaos out of which Creation progressed was equivalent to Huang-Ti, the Yellow Emperor, whom we have already encountered as a personification of the planet Saturn.\u201d Others, however, maintain that from chaos was born P\u2019an-ku, the entity responsible for Creation.\u00ae The Com- pendium of Wong-shi-Shing recounts how \u201cP\u2019an-ku came forth in the midst of the great chaotic world,\u201d having \u201cexisted before the shining of the light.\u201d We are further told that: \u201cAfter the chaos cleared away\u201d\u2014or after \u201cthe chaotic state passed away\u201d\u2014\u201cheaven appeared first in order, then earth.\u201d Parallel statements inform us that \u201cthe atmosphere had changed in character\u201d \u2014or \u201cthe atmosphere gradually cleared\u201d \u2014which seems to be the same as saying that the chaotic state had cleared.

One could conjecture that the stars might have been rendered invisible by the radiance, no matter how dim, emanating from the Saturnian sun. But, while true, we do not need to rely solely on that. If, as hypothesized, the Saturnian plasma- sphere was really opaque, it would have been enough to shield the stars from view. The Moon, I simply claim, was not yet in orbit around Earth.! As for the Sun, there is no way that Saturn\u2019s dim light could have blotted out its radiance. The question then revolves on the claimed opacity of the plasmasphere. Was the plasmasphere opaque enough to blot out the Sun\u2019s illumination? Unfortunately, as of this writing, not enough is known about planetary plasmaspheres to readily answer that question. As the plasma physicist Anthony Peratt informed me, \u201cthis is not a back of the envelope calculation,\u201d which would probably \u201cgive you the wrong answer anyway.\u201d What is required is a \u201cfull magnetohydrodynamic simulation with radiation trans- port,\u201d which would take \u201cseveral weeks once the problem was set up.\u201d Despite all that, Peratt was kind enough to supply me with a \u201ctop-of-the-head-opinion.\u201d While the scientific verdict is not yet in, Peratt\u2019s scholarly intuition is that \u201cit would be extremely difficult for a planetary plasmasphere to become opaque enough to entirely blot out the sun.\u201d? Thus, together with other evidence which I shall soon be supplying, the conclusion has been reached that, during the Saturnian age of darkness, the Sun was not merely hidden, that is obscured. Like the Moon, it was actually absent. Which raises the question: Where could it have been? To be sure, the Sun was always here. Only we were not. As far fetched as it might at first appear, what I am about to propose is that the Saturnian system, including Earth and its inhabitants, was originally exterior to the Solar family of planets and that, having spent long ages traveling alone in the darkness of space, it eventually invaded the Sun\u2019s domain to become a permanent member of the present planetary order. I realize that, by now, I have taken the reader with me into water that reaches well above our heads. We had better then start swimming \u2014but let us take it one stroke at a time. The concept that Earth had originally been exterior to the Solar System can be traced to the Cartesian naturalist Benoit de Maillet (1656-1738). Basing his belief on ancient tradi- tions, including the Book of Genesis, de Maillet reasoned that the primordial Earth had re- volved around a sun that was much smaller than the present one up until the time of the Bib- lical Deluge. In his scheme, Earth then left its original sun and invaded the Solar System as a",

Two centuries later, Immanuel Velikovsky was also of the opinion that a \u201cdark star\u201d might possibly invade our Solar System. As he wrote in 1950: \u201cThe solar system is not a structure that has remained unchanged for billions of years...Nor is there justification for the excuse that man cannot know or find out how this system came into being because he was not there when it was arranged in its pre- sent pattern...The Earth has come in [near-]contact with other planets and com- ets...Also, some dark star, like Jupiter or Saturn, may be in the path of the sun, and may be attracted to the system and cause havoc in it.\u201d4 As apostate as Velikovsky might have been, the idea of an interloper into the Solar Sys- tem is not exactly adverse to mainstream astronomy. Thus, for instance, in 1962, R. L. For- ward expressed the opinion that Pluto was an alien that had settled among the solar family. \u201cApparently Pluto is a stranger which arrived in its present orbit from the regions of space...It is as if Pluto had come along, interacted with Neptune, and pushed it into an inner orbit.\u201d> John Weir has even sought to account for the apparent deviations between the present motions of Venus and those recorded in the Babylonian Ninsianna Tablets (also known as the Tablets of Ammizaduqa) by postulating the capture of \u201ca relatively large body\u201d by the Solar System, which body \u201cmight have broken up and been \u2018captured\u2019 by Jupiter.\u201d6 This is highly interesting because the invasion of such a body would have had to have transpired during historical times as opposed to the millions of years into the past to which astronomers usually relegate such occurrences. It also proves that speculative events dictated by the contents of ancient historical documents are not outside the domain of conventional astronomers. Dilettantes, including Biblical fundamentalists, have also involved themselves in similar hypothesizing. Donald Patten, with whom this writer disagrees on too many issues, is also of the belief that Earth was once extraneous to the Sun\u2019s domain. As he wrote in 1967: \u201cHeliogenesis must be discarded in favor of Galactogenesis. Galactogenesis implies that our planet Earth, and its satellite, the Moon, have both spent ample astronomical time both beyond our solar system as well as within it. Hence...a catastrophic time table must include both pre-solar time (galactic time) and intra-solar time (time spent within the Sun\u2019s domain).\u201d7",

According to these two writers, the entire planets of the present solar family had once belonged to an extraneous system gov- ered by a dark star, the binary partner of the Sun, which they referred to as Planet X.8 In this scenario, the Planet X system would, from time to time, have approached closer to the Sun where, with each close approach, the latter slowly stripped Planet X of its brood of planets, a few at a time. Patten and Windsor did not have the mytho-historical record in mind when they con- structed their scenario. Theirs was actually an attempt to disprove the nebular hypothesis usually attributed to Immanuel Kant and supplant it with what Patten and Windsor believed to be a more viable history of the formation of the Solar System.? They did not even seem to realize that Kant\u2019s nebular hypothesis had already been discarded at the time they proposed their theory. Thus, their various objections to Kant\u2019s nebular hypothesis are entirely superfluous. Besides, it did not even dawn on them that their version of the formation of the Solar System begged the question of how the Planet X system itself originated. On that score, if on no other, their scenario is as redundant as their objections. Worst of all, the detailed step by step description of the manner in which this planetary transfer too place, with precise orbital and rotational periods, values of eccentricity, closeness of approach, etcetera and so forth, both before and after capture, often given to many places of decimal, makes one think that the authors had actually been there at the time with a load of scientific instruments to record it all for posterity.!\u00b0 Theirs is not a methodology that inspires confidence, let alone credence. Actually, it was Ralph Juergens who set us on the right path. Back in 1977, basing his scenario on what little Velikovsky had yet published about the subject of Saturn, he was bold enough to climb out on what was then still considered something of a slim limb. As he wrote: \u201c...some points of...discussion may emerge from a consideration of Velikovsky\u2019s as yet unpublished evidence that Saturn was once a star and in all likelihood the Earth\u2019s \u201cSun\u2019 at one time... \u201cVelikovsky has stated that Satum was disrupted in a near-collision with Jupiter. Knowing little or nothing of the details, I can most easily imagine such an encounter in terms of a Saturnian planetary system, which included the Earth, being invaded, dismembered, and captured by an interloping system of relative giants consisting es- sentially of the present Sun and Jupiter... 1! Out in space, this would be the same as having the Saturnian system invading the Solar one, as per our present supposition. On the other hand, in this work, I have nothing to offer concerning the disruption of Saturn through a collision with Jupiter. Nevertheless, the hypothesis that Saturn and Earth had once constituted a planetary system that was exterior to ours fits our unfolding scenario to the proverbial Tee.",

        "main_text": "Following Juergens, Frederick Hall disclosed similar ideas of his own: \u201cMost stars are paired in binary systems. A few are trinities or orbit each other in groups of four or more. Still fewer go it alone. The Sun appears to be a loner. In re- cent years it has been postulated that the Sun, after all, may have its partner too, which would necessarily be a very small star, not seen as yet by astronomers. Neme- sis [as this solar companion has been dubbed] is posited to be in an extremely ellipti- cal orbit, approaching the Sun every 26 million years... \u201cA stronger likelihood, perhaps, is that Nemesis does not exist and will not be found. Nemesis would now be near its aphelion and, over an incredibly long moment arm, should exert a detectable tug on the Sun. No news is no news. But another possibility is also worth considering. If in the past there was a Nemesis and it is no longer out there, it may actually be here. Two stars in a binary system each may have a quota of terrestrial bodies and gas giant planets. If their orbital relationship is highly elliptical, both systems could suffer drastic changes at each close approach. The much smaller star would be subject to close encounters with gas giant satellites of the much larger star, involving a possible loss of considerable angular momentum and mass. Hence, it is possible that a former Nemesis is now part of our Solar System. \u201cIn the event of such a catastrophic event such a \u2018star\u2019 could also lose its ability to generate stellar amounts of heat and light and could be captured as a close-in gas gi- ant satellite of the larger star...If it is ultimately decided that Earth did arrive into the Solar System as a satellite of a Nemesis-like sun/planet\u2014perhaps Jupiter or Sat- urn\u2014then numerous geological mysteries would be cleared up and man\u2019s early pre- occupation with planetary worship would be much easier to understand.\u201d !2 Even more recently, the invasion of the Solar system by the Saturnian one, including Earth, has been taken up and expounded further by Wallace Thornhill. 3 Astronomers have not yet postulated that Earth may have originated outside our Sun\u2019s domain. But, in view of their recently revised history of the Solar Systems, as will be outlined below, even they are now asking whether Earth has always been where it is now.14 So where could it have been? EXTRA-SOLAR PLANETS When, in the 1980s, Carl Sagan aired his belief, earlier adhered to by Giordano Bruno, that the universe is filled with planets orbiting stars other than our own Sun, he was laughed out of court. As Kathy Svitil reported, unlike Bruno, Sagan \u201cwas spared the stake, but not the smug laughter of some of his fellow astronomers\u201d who were quick to point out that \u201cno planet had yet been found in any galaxy beyond our own solar system.\u201d !5",

        "main_text": "Maybe not in a different galaxy but, as early as 1967, Axel Firsoff had already been writing about the discovery of extra-solar planets as if they were in the realm of general knowledge. Thus, in explaining what he termed \u201cthe general plan of planetary systems,\u201d he already could refer to \u201csuper [JJovian planets, which are known to accompany some stars.\u201d ! Despite more recent reports to the contrary, the first of these extra-solar planets was dis- covered by D. Reuyl in 1936. With an estimated mass of 0.04 M, and an orbital period of 15 years, it was detected near the star known as Ross 614.17 Another planet already known to Firsoff is one \u201ca little less than twice as massive as Ju- piter,\u201d which orbits Proxima Centauri, 4.3 light years away. '8 These planets, it should be pointed out, are detected rather than observed. Stars which are accompanied by planets go through periodic wobbles which are ascertained through the Doppler shifts in their spectral lines, due to the attraction of their invisible attendants. The amount of wobble allows the accompanying planet\u2019s mass and orbit to be calculated. As Firsoff reported: \u201cSeveral other stars are known to have dark companions, but these are rather more massive than Proxima\u2019s big planet. Such superplanets may be partly degenerate, with interiors in superdense conditions encountered in White Dwarfs, and so could be quite small, despite their great masses.\u201d!9 Another body, which Firsoff referred to as \u201ca dark companion of about 10 times the mass of Jupiter,\u201d was also detected orbiting the red dwarf star Lalande 21185, which is calculated to be 8.1 (or 8.25 as newer sources have it) light years away and said to have a mass of 0.4 M. As Firsoff adds: \u201cThis discovery was due to the exceptionally large proper motion of the star, which changes its position in the sky by 4.8\" a year and, for this reason, was being closely followed.\u201d 2\u00b0 Firsoff did not enumerate the discoveries and identities of the extra-solar planets known in 1967 one by one, but he did state that \u201cnearly 10 superplanets are now known to be at- tached to the nearest stars.\u201d2! Thus, even then, Firsoff could claim that: \u201cFar from being exceptional, the Solar System is rather a humdrum example of planetary configurations. There are multiple stars, each with an array of planets of its own; close binaries sharing one or more planets; superplanets that may have planetary satellites, which may in turn be accompanied by moons.\u201d22 Astronomers are not always honest. Take, for instance, the planet supposedly discovered by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz in orbit around the star 51 Pegasi at a distance of 50 light years. More recently touted as the first such planet detected, Sam Flamsteed even spoke",

So, similarly, with the planet\u2014or, at least, a brown dwarf star\u2014said to orbit Proxima Centauri, which has recently been said to have first been discovered in 1998 through the Hubble Space Telescope.24 How, then, could Firsoff have written about it in 1967? But then, David Golimowski and Dan Schroeder nixed the whole thing. More sensitive observations led these two observers to conclude that no evidence really existed for such \u201ca brown dwarf or planet companion.\u201d As Golimowski stated: \u201cWe have images of Proxima that definitely should have revealed something. They did not.\u201d25 Even so, as of this writing, planets in extra-solar systems are being detected almost every month. These assemblages, however, bear little resemblance to our own Solar System. Cal- culated to be half the mass of Jupiter, the 51 Pegasi planet orbits its primary at a mere dis- tance of 5 million miles, which is seven times closer than tiny Mercury orbits our Sun. The planet completes its orbit in a mere 4.2 days.26 \u201cTo appreciate how bizarre this behavior is,\u201d writes Flamsteed, \u201cit helps to consider the bigger planets in our solar system\u2014Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are all at least a hundred times farther from the sun than 51 Peg[asi]\u2019s planet appears to be. And it takes them years\u2014a full dozen years, in the case of Jupiter\u2014to make a single orbit.\u201d27 What, then, of the belief that giant gas planets can only form somewhere in the middle of the revolving cloud of collapsing interstellar gas and dust that goes into forming a solar sys- tem? By the 1990s, astronomers had to ask: \u201cHow could a giant planet form so close to a star without being sucked in by gravity?\u201d8 Actually Doug Lin had already suggested that planets like Jupiter could migrate from an outer system in toward their parent star. Lin\u2019s hypothesis, however, did not envisage such giant planets ever coming to a halt close to their primary. His theory demanded that such planets would eventually be swallowed up by their sun. But, in view of newer discoveries, Lin and fellow astronomers were soon writing in Nature with two different scenarios aimed at getting a Jupiter-sized planet to stop short of being swallowed up.29 And then\u2014the see-saw of scientific opinion\u2014David Gray announced that the posited planet around 51 Pegasi was not really there at all.3\u00b0 Most astronomers, however, have disre- garded his conclusion, and the posited planet has now become fact. In the twelve months following this discovery and its attempted debunking, six other ex- tra-solar planets were announced as having been detected. Three of them were said to be Ju- piter-sized bodies orbiting \u201cabsurdly close\u201d to their primaries. Two others were found to orbit",

As Fred Rasio had to admit, \u201cyou get the impression that most solar systems are not like ours.\u201d32 Another planet was discovered orbiting the star Tau Bootis, which is slightly larger and hotter than our Sun, at a distance of sixty light-years. This planet has been calculated to have a mass equivalent to 3.87 that of Jupiter. It orbits its primary in a circular path in 3.3 days. It is 6.9 million kilometers (0.046 astronomical units) from its sun.33 This places it closer to its primary than Earth is to our Sun.

It is now believed that this star is or- bited by at least two planets. One of these is said to be the size of Jupiter at a distance equivalent to Saturn\u2019s distance from our Sun. The other planet, only slightly less massive than Jupiter, is believed to orbit Lalande at about the distance of the asteroid belt.34 The binary star system CM Draconis, 50 light-years away, is also believed to be orbited by a planet with a diameter equal to 85 percent that of Jupiter.

They could only think of two possible ways in which this stellar disk could have been unbalanced: it was either due to radiation from the star itself or the existence of a large planet which would have tugged at the debris in the disk. Two years later, Sally Heap, then of NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Cen- ter, trained Hubble\u2019s Imaging Spectrograph on Beta Pictoris to obtain closer views of the star and its disk. Her verdict was that the images she was able to resolve strongly suggested a planet or planets.3\u00b0 She did, however, warn that: \u201cBecause the star is shrouded in dust, it will be impossible to ever see any planets around Beta Pic., so I don\u2019t know how we will get a direct confirmation.\u201d3\u201d Another extra-solar planet, calculated to be 6.84 times the mass of Jupiter, has been de- tected orbiting the star 70 Virginis at a mere distance of 0.47 astronomical units in an orbital period of 116.7 days.38 It was unmasked by the team of Geoffrey Marcy and Paul Butler,\u00b0 who have found \u201cmore planets than anyone else in history.\u201d40 Six of these planets, brought to light by 1998, were featured in Astronomy; five others were reported by early 1999, two of which have been calculated to be 5 times the mass of Jupiter.4? In the year 2000 came news of the possible discovery of extra-solar planets which ap- peared to measure a mere 2.5 Earth radii. Or, at least, their possible shadows have been de-",

William Cochran and his collaborators from the University of Texas announced a planet \u201cthat closely resembles Jupiter\u201d around Epsilon Eridani, which is the closest star that is similar to our own Sun. Orbiting at 300 million miles from the star, it takes close to seven years to complete one circuit.4 Other extra-solar planets imbedded within the disks surrounding youthful stars, detected through means other than Doppler shifts, have been announced by Nick Gorkavyi at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center. Gorkavyi\u2019s method involves a search for \u201cwhorls and clumps produced by a planet\u2019s gravitational meddling.\u201d This method rewarded him with three new planets, including one that is said to be only 0.2 times the mass of Jupiter, revolving around Epsilon Eridani, 5.5 billion miles away, which would make it about twice the distance our own Neptune orbits from the Sun.45 An even smaller planet, weighing in at about 0.15 Jupiter\u2019s mass\u2014which makes it about half Saturn\u2019s mass\u2014has been detected circling the star HD 83443. This one has a second Saturn-sized planet which, as Svitil reported, \u201cbolsters the view that groupings like our solar system are not uncommon.\u201d 4 In January of 2001, the extra-solar planet-hunting team lead by Geoffrey Marcy an- nounced the detection of \u201ca pair of planets, each about the mass of Jupiter, that whirl around their home star [Gliese 876], 15 light-years from Earth in perfect lock-step.\u201d One of these planets takes 30 days to complete its orbit, the other \u201cexactly\u201d twice as long\u2014that is in a two-to-one ratio.47 Also announced by Marcy and his team is a solar system, dominated by the star HD 168443, at a distance of 123 light-years in the constellation Serpens. This system harbors a 7.7 to 15 Jupiter-mass planet accompanied by another body that has been calculated to be from 17 to 40 times as massive as Jupiter. A body that massive had astronomers scratching their heads since they could not \u201cquite figure what it can be.\u201d As Marcy himself noted: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit frightening.\u201d \u00ae \u201cWhat\u2019s frightening,\u201d reports Michael Lemonick, \u201cis that these discoveries make it clear how little astronomers know about planets...\u201d49 Or, as Princeton astronomer Scott Tremaine put it: \u201cNot a single prediction for what we\u2019d find in other systems has turned out to be cor- rect.\u201d50 As of this writing, the number of extra-solar planets that have been detected orbiting other stars had risen to 55.5! The problem caused by all these discoveries was succinctly stated by Flamsteed when he wrote that: \u201cAfter decades of searching, we\u2019ve finally found other planets orbiting other stars, and found them in abundance. Now the only problem is figuring out how on Earth to explain them.\u201d 52",

        "main_text": "THE REVISED HISTORY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM The discovery of dominant massive planets in extra-solar systems forced astronomers to revise their theories concerning the formation of solar systems in general. Assigning the problem to computers, simulations conducted by Frederic Rasio and Eric Ford resulted in models that were catastrophic enough to warm the hearts of Velikovskians. \u201cTn a system containing two Jupiter-like planets, the possibility exists that a dynami- cal instability will develop. Computer simulations suggest that in many cases this in- stability leads to the ejection of one planet while the other is left in a smaller, eccen- tric, orbit. In extreme cases, the eccentric orbit has a small enough periastron distance that it may circularize at an orbital period as short as a few days through tidal dissipa- tion. This may explain the recently detected Jupiter-mass planets in very tight circular orbits and wider eccentric orbits around nearby stars.\u201d In turn, this led to new theories concerning the formation of our own Solar System. As Josie Glausiusz commented: \u201c...the detection of extra-solar planets has forced astronomers to re-examine [the the- ory concerning the formation of our Solar System] because [these planets] present us with a paradox. Many are so monstrous in size, and hug their stars so closely, that they could not have formed in their present positions. The searingly hot stars around which they circle would have melted their rocky cores before they got started. In- stead, it\u2019s assumed that they coalesced some distance away, then barreled inward over millions of years. And if such chaos characterizes the birth of extra-solar planets, could not similar disorder have reigned closer to home? \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what astronomers are proposing. Instead of staid and steady motion from the start, they see turmoil. During the early years of our solar system, they say, giant planets were born, bounced about, swung past one another, and were flung apart before settling into their present orbits. [It is now suggested] that the massive icy planets Uranus and Neptune formed in close proximity to gassy Jupiter and Sat- urn, then barged past the behemoths into the far reaches of the solar system... \u201c[It is now suggested] that the emergence of a Jupiter-sized planet during the early years of a solar system can trigger chaos, birthing punier planets, then ejecting them in all directions.\u201d Even newer theories suggest that an alien star could easily pass by the Solar System and that this could alter Jupiter\u2019s orbit which could then pass so close to Earth that our world could easily be ejected into space or crash into the Sun.\u00b0> In fact, other theorists are now proposing that the early Solar System might have con- tained up to twenty planets in irregular orbits \u201cwhere they were eventually bound to col- lide.\u201d56",

        "main_text": "Dr. Renu Malhotra of the Lunar and Planetary Institute, Houston, has also argued that the orbits of the Solar System planets have undergone substantial alterations. \u201cOne thing is cer- tain,\u201d he has been reported as saying, \u201cthe idea that planets can change their orbits dramati- cally is here to stay.\u201d\u00b07 Even this was something of a revival of the theory propounded by J. G. Hills in 1969 in which it was \u201csuggested that the three outermost planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, were displaced into their present orbit by encounters with other planets.\u201d Described by C. J. Ransom as a consequence of Hill\u2019s analysis of the solar nebula, this theory concluded that \u201cSaturn was initially the outermost planet to form in the nebula.\u201d 8 Once unheard of, it is no longer possible to maintain that our Solar System has remained unchanged since its formation. Granted that astronomers are still keeping such events at arm\u2019s length by insisting that orbital changes within our System could only have transpired millions of years ago, we have reason to believe that some of these changes took place during the era of mankind. And, as we shall soon see, we are not alone in this belief. A MATTER OF NOMENCLATURE Beginning around October 2000, news began circulating that more than half of the so- called extra-solar planets that had been discovered up to then were not planets at all but, rather, brown dwarf stars, double stars, or low-mass stars.59 The reasons for this change of mind were variously given by various authorities. It was, for instance, reported that the radial velocity techniques behind the discoveries were inadequate to determine the angle of obser- vation which would affect the results concerning the masses involved. As announced by the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Allegheny Observatory: \u201cRadial velocity observations cannot dis- tinguish between a planet in an orbit that is viewed nearly edge on from a brown dwarf or stellar companion in an orbit that is nearly in the plane of the sky.\u201d Using astrometric data from the European Space Agency, as well as astral velocity data, astrophysicists from the United States and Korea have determined that the orbital inclinations of the objects in question are extremely low. In other words, \u201cthe orbital planes of these companions appear to be oriented nearly face on to the observer.\u201d6! According to David Black of the Lunar and Planetary Institute: \u201cThis contradicts the assumption that the line-of- sight angle is random in the radial velocity studies.\u201d\u00ae Putting it plainly, randomness dictates that some of these objects should be seen edge-on, while others face-on as viewed from our angle here on Earth. According to George Gatewood of the Allegheny Observatory: \u201cPart of the problem arises because masses smaller than that of Jupiter are very diffi- cult to detect [outside the Solar System], thus most of the objects that have been de- tected and are suspected to be planets have masses greater than that of Jupiter, the most massive planet in our solar system. Until very recently, there were few known objects between one Jupiter in mass and 80 times as much, and those are all small stars.\u201d63",

        "main_text": "But not everyone agreed with Black. As Geoffrey Marcy has been reported to have stated: \u201cThe claim by David Black is completely incorrect.\u201d Having risen to fame as one of the most successful of extra-solar planet-hunters, Marcy had something to lose if Black was correct. On the other hand, Marcy had a good argument. As he and others have pointed out, four of the companions which Black and his team had investigated are said to orbit their pri- maries \u201cwithin one degree of perfect alignment with the line of sight.\u201d65 \u201cYet the chance of any single partner of a given mass having that orientation is about 1 in 5,000. Conversely, for every partner with that orientation, there should be 5,000 or so with less extreme orientation. No such bodies are seen. Marcy is so convinced that he says Scientific American \u2018will be doing science a bum steer\u2019 simply by men- tioning Black\u2019s work.\u201d But then, Tsevi Mazeh and Shay Zucker weighed in from Tel Aviv University with the suggestion that \u201cthe truth lies somewhere in the middle.\u201d Concerning the four companions investigated by Black, they claim that two of them do indeed \u201chave the heft of a star.\u201d The other two, according to them, do not.\u00ae7 Others suspect that the analyses \u201chave fallen prey to subtle computational biases,\u201d and that \u201cit is quite plausible that searchers have unwittingly skewed their sample,\u201d and that higher precision astrometry as well as other methods are needed to resolve the debate. Eventually, even Marcy was forced to give an inch when the then newly discovered outer companion to yet another star was estimated to be \u201cbetween 17 and 40 times\u201d the mass of Jupiter. As Marcy was reported to have admitted, \u201c[this one] seems too large for a conven- tional planet.\u201d \u201c*We frankly don\u2019t know what name to give it!\u2019 Marcy said. \u2018Is it a planet or brown dwarf...? We simply don\u2019t know\u2019.\u201d7\u00b0 As Lemonick phrased it: \u201c.,.maybe astronomers will have to rethink their definition of \u2018planet.\u2019 Just because we put heavenly objects into categories doesn\u2019t mean the distinctions are necessarily valid.\u201d7! Eventually some astronomers decided to refer to objects less than 10 Jupiters in mass as planets. Anything over that is to be termed a brown dwarf star.\u201d Others decided that objects less than 13 times the mass of Jupiter should be classified as planets, while those between 13 and 75 Jupiter masses should be termed brown dwarf stars.\u201d In other words, the dilemma was temporarily, and arbitrarily, alleviated by invoking nomenclature.",

        "main_text": "By 2002, astrophysicists were again up in arms concerning the definition of celestial objects. By then, they were not even sure what a planet really was, let alone red and brown dwarf stars. Alan Stern and Harold Levison attempted to come up with a new criteria, but this did not help much since it was still reliant on mass. Thus, according to them, a planet has to be a body \u201clow enough in mass that at no time, past or present, can it generate energy in its interior due to any self-sustaining fusion reaction.\u201d74 But, as Adam Burrows pointed out: \u201cThere is an unfounded prejudice that a planet should not have a thermonuclear phase,\u201d and that this was merely a preconception that might not be verified by observable facts.75 As far as our thesis is concerned, it does not much matter whether these so-called extra- solar planets are really planets, brown dwarf stars, or some of each, since our scenario ac- counts for both a planet (Earth) and a brown dwarf star (Saturn) as having been partners outside the Solar System. THE RUNAWAY PLANET Extra-solar planets were not only found orbiting stars, but even escaping from them. At least one such planet was said to have been discovered streaming away from the double star system known as TMR-1, 450 light-years from Earth, with a separation between them of 3.7 billion miles. Moreover, this one was actually visible through the Hubble Space telescope and has been photographed. Discovered by Susan Terebey, the planet was calculated to be \u201ctwo to three times Jupiter\u2019s mass, flung off in a gravitational tug-of-war between the [two] stars.\u201d The planet was said to be racing away at a speed of 20,000 miles an hour.7\u00b0 Unfortunately, this discovery was eventually questioned. The pertinent planet was later explained as nothing more than a background star. This was \u201cdeduced\u201d from the spectrum of the object in question which (a) showed no signs of water vapor, and (b) appears to be too hot, at 2,700\u00b0 Kelvin (4,400\u00b0 F), to be a protoplanet?\u2019\u2014even though, personally, I am not quite sure why these parameters should rule out a protoplanet. Even so, Terebey herself has not entirely ruled out her original assumption. As a report by her reads: \u201cAt this time there is no strong evidence that TMR-IC itself is a protoplanet.\u201d78 But she added: \u201cThe models are not yet reliable at such young ages, so this test by itself is not con- clusive. The idea remains alive and well that there may be runaway planets and brown dwarfs...which formed via ejection from multiple star systems.\u201d Eight months later, Scientific American republished the photograph of TMR-1C with a caption referring to it as a \u201cpossible\u201d protoplanet \u201changing on\u201d to the star.\u00ae\u00b0 And there, at the time of this writing, the matter rested. Again, to us, it does not matter whether TMR-1IC is truly an escaped planet. What con- cerns us is that it was originally accepted as such, which means that planets escaping from their systems are in the realm of possibility. Even Phil Lucas, as we shall soon see, would not",

LONE TRAVELERS THROUGH SPACE There were other surprises in store. By July of 2000, thirteen extra-solar planets traveling alone through the coldness of space without an accompanying primary \u2014that is without a sun to sustain them\u2014had been spotted by Phil Lucas and Patrick Roche. Their masses have been estimated to be eight times that of Jupiter. Lucas and Roche suspected that \u201cthese planets grew directly out of a cloud of cold gas and dust\u2014not from a disk surrounding an infant star, the way normal planets do.\u201d8! As Lucas himself stated: \u201cWe can\u2019t rule out the possibility that some might have been flung out of a solar system, but it looks like they have always been free-floating.\u201d82 As it happens, the existence of such bodies traveling alone through space had also been predicted by Firsoff thirty-three years earlier when he wrote that: \u201cAlthough proof is lacking, it seems virtually certain that sunless planets, unattached to stars, do exist.\u201d83 Proof, it seems, is no longer lacking. In December of 2000, it was reported that Maria Zapatero-Osorio and her colleagues from the California Institute of Technology had spotted 18 solitary planets, \u201cinexplicably not circling any stars, in a young stellar cluster in Orion.\u201d As Svitil reported: \u201cThese gaseous giants are doomed to a life of eternal darkness. Scientists are not sure why they exist; according to the prevailing models, planets can form only around stars.\"85 Actually, these objects seem to be more than just planets. What Zapatero-Osorio claims to have discovered is a conglomeration that consists of \u201cstars, brown dwarfs and large, gassy planet-sized objects\u201d all existing \u201cwithout the discipline of a solar system.\u201d8\u00b0 As her team reported: \u201cInstead of orbiting neatly around a central star, they drift along in a loose collabo- ration.\u201d87 In a telephone interview, she continued by stating that: \u201cThe formation of young, free-floating, planetary-mass objects like these is difficult to explain by our current models of how planets form...We think they originated in a similar way to stars and brown dwarfs\u2014a big cloud broke down into small pieces. Some were large enough to produce stars, while other fragments were very small and they yielded the objects we discovered in the cluster...[These bodies are to be found in] an area that has a high concentration of stars, and they are homogeneously distrib- uted within the cluster\u2014one star, one brown dwarf, one planetary mass body, one star, one brown dwarf, one planetary mass body and so on.\u201d88",

Using spectrometers, which measure visible and invisible energy alike, Zapatero-Osorio\u2019s team \u201cactually saw the objects they describe.\u201d\u00ae\u00b0 As with Phil Lucas, and despite her belief that these bodies would have had to have been formed independently, Zapatero-Osorio did not rule out the possibility that they may have been ejected from other systems containing stars around which they would have originally orbited.% The eighteen lone travelers through space soon rose to twenty five; and the theorized ex- istence of hundreds of others soon rose to hundreds of millions of footloose planets wander- ing through the Milky Way.?! What is perhaps more important to our own study, however, is Firsoff's conclusion in re- lation to these lonesome planets. \u201cIn the absence of the ionising radiation of the star,\u201d he wrote, \u201c[such planets] should be able to retain more extensive atmospheres, and, while ter- restrial planets of this kind would be very cold, large [JJovian or sub-[J]ovian masses may have enough internal heat to allow any type of life, even based on our carbohydrate chemis- try, to develop on their surfaces.\u201d92 Although we shall probably never know whether Saturn and Earth are bodies that escaped from another solar system, we have seen that such liberated planets are considered to be within the realm of possibility. Planets traveling alone through space have now become quite common. There is, therefore, nothing impossible about Earth having traveled together with Saturn through the cold realms of space before they came within the grips of our present Sun. As Firsoff admitted, Jovian and even sub-Jovian masses may retain enough internal heat to allow life to develop and sustain itself. Our own hypothesis differs only slightly from this in that it was Saturn\u2019s heat which allowed the existence of life on Earth. True, Saturn is less massive than Jupiter and, at its present mass, falls short of the requirements for it to be con- sidered a brown dwarf star since, as we have seen, such stars have masses ranging from about 15 to 80 times that of Jupiter.\u00b0? However, it has been ascertained that \u201cbrown dwarfs bridge the entire gap between stars and planets,\u201d with low-mass candidates being more numerous than high-mass ones, \u201cand this trend continues down nearly to planetary masses.\u201d It has even been conjectured that \u201cthe masses of brown dwarfs and planets can actually overlap each other!\u201d95 Besides, as I intend to show in the proposed sequel to this volume, there is reason to believe that, as a brown dwarf star, proto-Saturn was once more massive. It is now believed that there are twice as many brown dwarfs as there are \u201creal\u201d stars.\u00b0\u00b0 Moreover, it has been found out that \u201cfar more brown dwarfs float freely than orbit stars.\u201d97 It has additionally been conjectured that one of them \u201cmight even be stirring up the Oort",

THE ABSENT SUN The myths we have so far enumerated may therefore be seen as constituting man\u2019s col- lective memory of that ancient time when Earth, in the company of its celestial primary, was traveling through the blackness of outer space, far from the Sun, illuminated feebly by Sat- urn\u2019s meager glow, but basking in the warmth of that primeval giant which was, from time immemorial, the first\u2014and for a while the only\u2014god man knew. Can the mytho-historical record further support this wild contention? Primitive man would not have known that he was living outside our Solar System. Of solar systems and brown dwarf stars\u2014even of planets, per se\u2014he knew nothing. All that he could later recollect was that the Sun had been absent during the earliest times he could re- member. I believe we have supplied enough of man\u2019s ancient memory concerning that period in previous pages. Here I will merely add two snippets concerning Raven, Raven Boy, and Wanadi, simply because we had already had something different to relate concerning these mythological entities. Thus, among the Eskimos it is told how Raven Boy absconded with the sun but that, at his father Raven\u2019s behest, he \u201cset the sun back in its old place so that light once more re- turned to the earth.\u201d \u201cBut it was not the unremitting light of former days, for Raven Boy feared that if the people forgot the terrors of darkness, they would forget also Raven\u2019s teaching. With a sweep of a wing, he sent the sky spinning round the earth, carrying the sun with it and in this way day and night were created.\u201d!00 What this tells us is that the sun which Raven Boy absconded with was one that shed an \u201cunremitting light,\u201d which hints at a sun that neither rose nor set. This, then, would have al- luded to the immobile Saturnian sun. The sun he set back in place, on the other hand, was one that went \u201cround the earth\u201d \u2014in other words, our present Sun. The Makiritare of Venezuela, whom we have also met on a previous page, revered Wa- nadi as he \u201cwho shines in the highest heaven.\u201d !\u00b0! But since, as we have already seen, this Wanadi was said to have been \u201clike a sun that never sets,\u201d !\u00b02 we have every reason to believe that the reference is to the once immobile Saturnian sun. The light from this Wanadi was said to have eventually failed from coming down anymore. And that is why, the Makiritare say, \u201cthe new Wanadi made this sun for us, to make it light for us during the day.\u201d And: \u201cWhen the new Wanadi came, it dawned again.\u201d 13",

What is of additional interest is that, in a strange sort of way, the absence of the Sun, and its eventual \u201cbirth,\u201d continues to be commemorated to the present day in an ancient Peruvian ritual which, in time, gained Catholic overtones.

Does primitive man remember anything of the sort? Records of the slowly approaching Sun are somewhat rare. But then there is another point to consider. In view of the immobile Saturnian sun which shone perpetually above him, would prehistoric man have really paid much attention to a slowly growing pin-point of light in the sky? And, of those that did, how many might have forgotten what to them would have seemed an unobtrusive circumstance? As Thornhill rightly claimed, \u201cthe [Saturnian] celestial effects as viewed from Earth would have been so dramatic that it seems to have completely overshadowed even the growing appearance of the Sun as this loomed closer.\u201d!07 And yet, the Okanagan Indians seem to have retained just such a memory when they speak of that time, \u201clong, long ago, when the sun was young and no bigger than a star...\u201d 18 For the first time in the history of mankind, a light other than Saturn\u2019s managed to shine through the night of nights. The Ipurinas of the Upper Amazon not only preserved a similar record of the Sun\u2019s origi- nal small size but also of its growing larger as Earth drew nearer. \u201cThe \u2018sun\u2019 they tell...was originally very small, hardly \u2018a nail\u2019s breadth\u2019 across. But one day it suddenly began to grow till it was \u2018a span\u2019 across. Then the waters began to rise and overflowed the world.\u201d! A similar belief concerning the subject at hand is also to be found among the Sia of New Mexico which, like that of the Ipurinas, also adds some interesting aspects of its own. As it is related by these people: \u201cWhen the sun was far off, his face was blue; as he came nearer, the face grew brighter. Yet they did not see the sun himself, but only a large mask which covered his whole body.\u201d !!\u00a9 The main interesting point behind this ancient conviction is that the Sun was not merely remembered as having been smaller in size, or that it grew in size, but that it had actually once been \u201cfar off.\u201d It also correctly presents the view that the Sun \u201cgrew brighter\u201d as it came nearer which, logical as this would be, is not mentioned in the other records we have examined. The other additional point it mentions is that, when the Sun was still much farther away, its face was blue. What this might relate to will be explained in the proposed sequel to this work. In the meantime, and in order to forestall an objection, let us again look at our hypothesis from an astronomical point of view. When, in 1978, I had sent rough drafts of the above",

It was reasoned that, if the Sun had first appeared \u201cno bigger than a star,\u201d it would have taken more than the entire length of man\u2019s sojourn on Earth for it to come close enough to appear of the size of the present Sun. As the late David Griffard pointed out: \u201cAs point sources...apparent differences in the size of stars are only differences in brightness. To appear literally as an ordinary star (about 3rd or 4th magnitude) as seen on a clear night, the present Sun would have to be removed about 10 light-years. Even if much closer and really, say, at zero magnitude...it would still have been four or five light-years away. \u201cWith present rates of relative stellar motion as guidelines, the growth from star to Sun would have taken many tens of thousands of years even if the fastest observed closing speed (about 60 mi/sec) is chosen; if at slower, more common speeds, (e.g. 12 mi/sec), many eons longer.\u201d !!! It is, then, the words \u201cno bigger than a star\u201d that seems to have led to the objection. \u201cNo bigger than\u201d should not, however, be construed to mean \u201cno closer than.\u201d In any case, who ever said anything about the size of the approaching Sun having been of 3rd or 4th magni- tude? Obviously, the Okanagan Indians, who were not astronomers, were not using this term in a strictly astronomical sense. They were merely reporting what their ancestors had claimed to have seen. Besides, as Griffard himself pointed out, \u201cif first seen, say from the distance of Pluto (taken as an arbitrary estimate of the limits of the Sun\u2019s domain) the Sun conceivably could have appeared star-like and the time-line be reduced.\u201d !!2 And, true enough, as seen from the vicinity of Pluto, the Sun is still no bigger than \u201ca bright star,\u201d1!3 described as a \u201cpinpoint Sun\u201d even though \u201cintensely bright.\u201d!!4 At Pluto\u2019s mean distance from the Sun, taken at 3,656 million miles, and traveling at 12 mi/sec, Earth would have reached its present position in the Solar System in a mere ten years\u2014but only if it had invaded the System in a direct vector. The probability, however, is that, once captured within the Sun\u2019s attractive force, the Saturnian system would have slowly spiraled in, much in the manner hypothesized by astrophysicists in relation to their revised history of the Solar System as outlined above. Such an entry could have taken any number of years in excess of ten. Astronomers are fond of describing such events as having taken millions of years. Will they here allow me at least a few thousand? But then the reader might have\u2014should have, really\u2014noticed a discrepancy in our thinking at this point. How could the Sun, appearing no bigger than a star, have been visible through our plasmasphere when that same plasmasphere has been theorized to have been opaque enough to blot out the stars? Can we have our cake and eat it too? Of course not. And here a confession is in order. I have presented these mytho-historical snippets concerning the approaching Sun as if the event took place during the age of darkness when, in truth, the event took place later. In other words, I have presented these data out of chronological sequence merely to make my point. The approaching Sun, appearing no bigger than a star, became visible to Earth\u2019s inhabitants at that time when the plasmasphere came in contact with that of the Sun itself. As Thornhill",

To be sure, much more than that ensued but that is left to the planned sequel to this work. SEVENTH INTERLUDE We can now add to our set of theses which will read as follows: Hypothesis #1: That, from what can be deduced from ancient as well as primitive astronomical lore, Earth had once been a satellite of the planet Saturn, originally a brown dwarf star, which, because of its proximity, loomed large in the sky as a distinct disc larger than the apparent size of the full Moon. Hypothesis #2: That, still according to ancient astronomical lore, during this indeterminate period, Satur was the only visible celestial body in Earth\u2019s primordial sky. Hypothesis #3: That, as seen from Earth, the Saturnian primary did not rise and/or set, but remained visibly immobile at all times. Hypothesis #4: That Saturn\u2019s immobility was due to the fact that Earth was stationed directly \u201cbeneath\u201d Saturn\u2019s south pole and that, from Earth, Saturn therefore appeared to be permanently fixed in the north celestial sphere, the very place now occupied by the Pole Star. What this also means is that Saturn and Earth were linearly aligned with both of them sharing the same axis of rotation. Hypothesis #5: That both Earth and Saturn were embedded in a plasmasphere centered on proto-Saturn, the opacity of which enabled proto-Saturn\u2019s radiation to be reflected toward all terrestrial latitudes. Hypothesis #6: That, according to some of man\u2019s earliest memories, Earth was originally engulfed in what our ancestors persistently referred to as darkness. This was an age which, despite its remoteness in time, ended up etching itself indelibly in human consciousness. It was a time during which the Sun, the Moon, and the stars were not yet visible in the sky. Saturn ruled alone. Hypothesis #7: This age, we have also found out, could not have been one of total darkness, and that, in fact, mankind itself remembers that the Saturnian deity actually shed a feeble light. The terrestrial environment during this age was bathed in a perpetual twilight or, rather, a protracted dawn, which man remembered as the dawn of Creation. Hypothesis #8: Proto-Saturn\u2019s illumination, feeble as it might have been, together with the plasmasphere\u2019s opacity are recognized as the means by which the stars were kept from visibility. The plasmasphere\u2019s opacity, however, would probably not have been enough to blot out the Sun.. Hypothesis #9: That, during this period, a nebulous entity, which our ancestors had difficulty in describing clearly, surrounded the Saturnian primary. We have conjectured this entity to have been a placental cloud, or circumstellar disk, surrounding the Saturnian orb. This entity seems to have been that to which the ancients alluded to as Chaos. Hypothesis #10: During this same unspecified period, the Saturnian orb was seen to float over an apparition which, to ancient man, looked like water, a cosmic ocean. This \u201cwater\u201d was probably the same nebular disk which, spinning slowly, would have had the appearance of a celestial whirlpool. Hypothesis # 11: That, due to Saturn\u2019s immobility, and the absence of the Sun, ancient man had nothing at his disposal by which he could calculate the passage of time.",

In fact, as Wallace Thornhill has correctly speculated, life might have been much better suited to Earth as a satellite of the brown dwarf star that was proto-Saturn out in the far reaches of space.! Nor is this merely Thornhill\u2019s conjecture. Astronomers are now voicing similar propositions. There was a time, not so long ago, when the idea of life surviving on a planet heated by a dwarf star in the coldness of space outside our Solar System would have been deemed bizarre in the extreme. Newer studies and discoveries, however, have tended to make such a scenario quite palatable. Thus, those who have sought signs of habitable worlds other than our own are now looking to dwarf stars to furnish such evidence. Ken Croswell put it in a nutshell when he stated that: \u201cFar from being desolate backwaters, red dwarfs may harbour an abun- dance of alien life.\u201d \u201cIt was always thought that any planet orbiting a red dwarf would be an extremely unlikely place to find life. But it now looks as though these dim red suns could har- bour most of the Galaxy\u2019s life-bearing worlds.\u201d3 For one thing, as Croswell notes, stars like our present Sun are relatively rare while four out of every five stars in our Galaxy happen to be red dwarfs. These stars have a somewhat cool core and the nuclear reactions which are believed to fuel them take place at a slow rate. \u201cThe nearest red dwarf\u2014Proxima Centauri, which is 4 light years from Earth,\u201d notes Cros- well, \u201cemits less visible light in a century than the Sun does in a week.\u201d It is no wonder, then, that dwarf stars had earlier been ruled out as sustainers of habitable planets. This problem has now been overcome by positing planets \u201chuddled close enough\u201d to such stars, which contiguity would ensure \u201ca balmy climate.\u201d As Croswell explains: \u201cFor a red dwarf with one-hundredth of the Sun\u2019s brightness, for instance, a planet would be at a suit- able temperature if it circled ten times closer to its parent star than the Earth does to the Sun.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019d asked me a few years ago,\u201d David Soderblom has been reported to have stated, \u201cI would have said that red dwarfs have a very low probability of having life-bearing plan-",

But hold on, the reader might say. Proto-Saturn has been hypothesized to have been a brown, rather than a red, dwarf star. Brown dwarf stars, however, are actually red; they have merely been designated as brown dwarfs only because the term \u201cred dwarfs\u201d had already been assigned to their slightly more massive siblings. True, brown dwarfs are said to radiate through a slightly different process. They are believed to \u201cglow dimly from heat generated by gravitational contraction and the fusion of deuterium.\u201d7 (If, as some claim, stars are fueled electrically, however, even this distinction disappears.) In any case, both red and brown dwarfs come in various masses, so that the dividing line between them, as that between brown dwarfs and planets, becomes merely arbitrary. If, therefore, life-bearing planets can orbit red dwarf stars, they can just as easily accompany brown dwarfs. And, to be sure, even as the writing of this work progresses, the idea that planets can orbit brown dwarfs is being seriously considered.8 PHASE LOCK As Croswell explained, planetary orbits around dwarf stars \u201cwould come at a price.\u201d? \u201cA planet in such a tight orbit would become tidally locked to its star, just as our own Moon is locked to Earth. One side would perpetually face the star, while the other faced away.\u201d 10 While this, too, is in keeping with our own hypothesis, it also brings to mind Lynn Rose\u2019s postulate, which we contested in an earlier chapter, concerning the nature of Earth\u2019s marriage to proto-Saturn. As we saw there, he, too, had posited a similar phase-lock wherein Earth displayed the same hemisphere toward its primary, but contrary to our axis-sharing hypothe- sis. Without thinking to credit Rose, such a phase-lock between Earth and proto-Saturn had also been considered by Frederick Hall who assumed Earth \u201cto have formerly been a nearly spherical satellite of Saturn, circling the giant orb in about 28 days, with a slow spin and the same side of the Earth always facing Saturn.\u201d!! As he continued: \u201cProto-Saturn is [read \u2018would have been\u2019] vast in comparison to Earth and perhaps much larger [read \u2018more massive\u2019] than the body we know today.

How, then, did he reconcile his two opposing views?",

        "main_text": "Despite the mytho-historical evidence, Earth\u2019s axis-sharing lock with Saturn had always been the most difficult aspect of the Saturn thesis to reconcile with celestial mechan- ics\u2014which is why Rose could never accept the concept. Hall attempted to resolve the diffi- culty by claiming that Earth was originally phase-locked with proto-Saturn before it was torn away from its primary during the system\u2019s entry into the Sun\u2019s domain. According to Hall, the \u201cpolar alignment occurred due to a massive gravitational pull on Saturn\u201d which would have left Earth \u201ctrailing after it.\u201d!3 As of this writing, Thornhill, too, is of similar belief. The \u201cspectacular Saturnian polar configuration,\u201d according to him, came into being \u201cwhen [proto- Saturn\u2019s] planetary system was disrupted by the Sun in a manner similar to that when Jupiter disrupted comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 into a \u2018string of pearls\u2019.\u201d!4 Thus, according to him, the Saturnian \u201ccollinear equilibrium...could not have been primordial.\u201d 15 To be sure, this is not necessarily a fallacious interpretation and it should not be dis- missed out of hand. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that as far back as man\u2019s memory can reach, the Saturnian sun had always occupied the north celestial pole. What the situation might have been prior to that will be discussed in a later chapter of this work. ATMOSPHERIC AMPLITUDE One problem inherent in the phase-lock theory involves the amount of heat shed by the dwarf star on the orbiting planet\u2019s hemisphere facing it. As Croswell pointed out, \u201cthe day side of a red dwarf planet would fry.\u201d!\u00a9 What is perhaps worse is that \u201cthe night side would be so frigid\u201d that the atmosphere itself would be expected to freeze. 17 How could life have survived such conditions. One way out of this dilemma, according to Croswell, would be to postulate that such a planet\u2019s atmosphere would be \u201csufficiently thick.\u201d !8 \u201cResearchers [have] calculated that gases circulating in the atmosphere would then be able to transport heat from the planet\u2019s day side to its night side, warming the night air so that it wouldn\u2019t freeze out.\u201d!9 Such transportation of heat from one hemisphere to the other would not only warm the planet\u2019s night side, it would also cool its day side resulting in a balanced heat regime. What is interesting in this is that the same situation had also been proposed in relation to Earth itself. It was in the mid-19th century that the British anatomist, Richard Owen, demanded a denser terrestrial atmosphere, containing elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide and reduced oxygen, in order for prehistoric pterodactyls to have been able to fly and navigate.2? Much later, Frederic Jueneman had much to say concerning the inability of pterodactyls, known to have had wingspans of up to 36 feet, to fly and navigate in Earth\u2019s present sky, and why a denser atmospheric envelope would have been required for such flight in prehistoric times.?!",

Having intro- duced this idea in various entries in his running column\u2014\u2018\u201cInnovative Notebook\u201d \u2014which appeared in Industrial Research & Development during 1985, he collated most of that mate- rial into a single article which was published in AEON in 1991.8 \u201cWere our planet to have had such an atmospheric envelope approaching some 20,000 km (12,000 mi) in depth with solid earth at its core, the total diameter would be approximately 52,000 km (32,000 mi), and would be in the Neptune class of the smaller giants. This would be merely some 15 times our present mass and only about four times the diameter.\u201d24 This idea was also picked up by Roger Wescott as a possibility to account for his Saturn- like Asterian scenario,?> as also by Robert Driscoll in his tentative account re the disruption of the primeval Saturnian system.2\u00a9 Again, even were we to ignore the earlier demand of Richard Owen, the hypothesis is not, of itself, foreign to orthodox astronomy.

According to Berner, this was due to \u201cthe rise of land plants in general and in particular to the vast and verdant swamps that characterized the Carboniferous.\u201d32 \u201cAll those swamp plants spit oxygen into the atmosphere, and when they died, they escaped the open-air decomposition by bacteria that would have drawn oxygen back out of the atmosphere. Instead they sank into the swamps, ultimately forming coal deposits that gave the Carboniferous its name.\u201d33 Never mind that there is no direct evidence of higher atmospheric oxygen levels during the Carboniferous. After all, Berner\u2019s hypothesis is simply based on a computer model. Even so, as Shanti Menon explained, the oxygen-rich atmosphere hypothesized by Berner would have made for \u201ca denser atmosphere that provided more lift and thus made it easier for [Carboniferous insects] to fly.\u201d34 While this is in keeping with Jueneman\u2019s Pleiongaea, it should be kept in mind that, as Menon was forced to admit, the whole idea is \u201ca hypothesis based on a hypothesis.\u201d35 But then, around 1985, Dale Russell and Parvez Kumar also came to the conclusion that Earth\u2019s atmosphere had to have been much denser than at present. But is a denser atmospheric envelope really required for the sustenance of life on a planet reliant for its heat on a dwarf star? Until recently, such a dense atmosphere around a dwarf star planet had been thought to be detrimental to life since it would prevent the star\u2019s rays from reaching the planet\u2019s surface and thus inhibiting photosynthesis, \u201ca serious blow for the development of life as we know it.\u201d But then, simulation of a red dwarf planet\u2019s atmosphere conducted by Robert Haberle and Manoj Joshi in the 1990s showed that a thick envelope would not really be required. As they stated, \u201ceven a thin atmosphere would do the trick.\u201d37 \u201cIf the planet had only 15 per cent as much air as the Earth...that would still ferry enough heat around to the dark side to keep the atmosphere from freezing out.\u201d38 The density, or otherwise, of a planet\u2019s atmosphere, however, is relative. Even an atmos- phere as dense as that of Venus, which has been blamed for its infernal heat, much denser than that proposed for Earth by the above proponents, is not enough to obstruct the Sun\u2019s rays. And if pterodactyls and giant insects really required a denser atmosphere in order to fly and navigate, we will accept that. After all, the view that Earth was nestled within proto-Sat- urn\u2019s envelope is not incompatible with a denser terrestrial atmosphere. THE CRADLE OF LIFE Keeping the atmosphere from freezing on the night side of such a planet is one thing, keeping the water, still believed to be the cradle of life, in the same hemisphere from suffer- ing the same fate is quite another. \u201cEven in some of Joshi and Haberle\u2019s models, there re- mained freezing conditions on the planet\u2019s dark side.\u201d At first, this led to something of an",

Even if the oceans\u2019 surface were to freeze on the dark side, rea- soned Heath, there might still be liquid layers deep underneath which would be kept from freezing by the planet\u2019s own geothermal heat. \u201cThis would allow liquid water to flow back to the day side.\u201d40 In the proto-Saturnian model, such a transference of liquid water from one hemisphere to the other would not even be required. As we have seen, according to more than one re- searcher, Earth would have been located within proto-Saturn\u2019s plasma sheath. To repeat, as both Ashton and Thornhill claimed, the heat and light of proto-Saturn would have been \u201cra- diated both outwards and inwards from the photosphere\u201d; that \u201cEarth, situated inside the spherical envelope of such a star...would find the energy flux almost equal over the entire planet\u201d; and that \u201call objects orbiting in that region would receive the same energy per unit area of their surface.\u201d4! No freezing of oceanic surfaces would then enter the picture. STATIONARY STAR On such a planet in phase-lock as envisioned by Croswell, the red dwarf sun would never set. \u201cInstead,\u201d he tells us, this sun \u201cwould hover perpetually at the same place in the sky.\u201d4? As we have seen, this would also have been the case in our axial alignment model except that, in our case, the proto-Saturnian sun would have hovered in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole. In this instance, the model proposed by Croswell runs into certain difficulties which the Sat- urnian exemplar overcomes. As Croswell pointed out: \u201cPlants and trees might orient themselves toward [the hovering red dwarf star] as they grew. But because the sun is stationary some regions would never see direct sunlight. A region in the shadow of a mountain, for example, would be forever in shade, pre- venting photosynthesis there.\u201d3 The situation would be even worse in the total darkness of the opposing hemisphere. This predicament, however, would not affect the proto-Saturnian model since, as already noted, the light from the hovering proto-Saturnian sun, no matter how feeble, would have been re- flected back from the enveloping plasma to all those areas devoid of direct sunlight. LONG-LIVED SUN How long could such a situation have endured? Croswell tells us that red dwarf stars actually have an advantage over sun-like ones. This is because their lesser mass allows them to \u201cburn\u201d their reduced fuel \u201cso frugally that some will survive for more than 1000 billion years,\u201d whereas the Sun, it is claimed, \u201cwill die within a mere 8 billion years.\u201d44",

If intelligence generally requires more time to emerge, then planets orbiting red dwarfs may be ideal.\u201d 45 It therefore seems that, by entering the Solar System, Earth actually moved into a more hostile, rather than a more benign, environment. THE SEARCH FOR DWARF STAR PLANETS All this might be interesting but, the reader may ask, is it known that dwarf stars are ac- companied by planets? Actually, planets in company of red dwarf stars have already been detected. These plan- ets, however, are \u201cmore akin to Jupiter\u201d than they are to Earth. Two Jupiter-sized planets, for instance, have been detected circling the red dwarf known as Gliese 876 which is said to lie a mere 15 light years from us. \u201cThese particular planets are unlikely to harbour life...since Ju- piter-sized planets \u2014at least in our Solar System\u2014consist mostly of hydrogen and helium.\u201d 4 Laurance Doyle, on the other hand, believes that his team may have detected an Earth- sized world around CM Draconis, a binary red dwarf system. Because of the difficulty of detecting such small bodies, Doyle could only supply a \u201c50-50\u201d chance of this being correct. In the meantime, however, he and his team have other candidates which, as of this writing, they were still investigating.47 There are other details brought out by Croswell in relation to dwarf star planets, but these, too, must be reserved for a future volume. There is, however, one other element of such a system that I wish to touch upon because it serves to introduce the subject of the next chapter which, in turn, will allow us to investigate further whether an axial alignment of Earth with its proto-Saturnian sun was ever the case. As Croswell informed his readers, a red dwarf planet would be bereft of seasons since \u201cthe tidal pull of the star would prevent its spin axis from tilting.\u201d In the model he espouses, needless to say, only one side would be basked in perpetual light, with the other hemisphere being in perpetual darkness. In this model, the hottest place on the planet would be one spot on the equator, with temperatures falling in a radiating path, \u201cfalling toward freezing near the dividing line between the day and night sides.\u201d Moreover, an ice cap would form in the very centre of the night side.48 As Heath phrased it: \u201cThe daylight hemisphere is going to be where the action is. For one thing, it\u2019s going to be pretty cold on the dark side. We know that there are organisms that can sit in water pockets in the ice and carry out photosynthesis, but they can\u2019t do that if there\u2019s no light getting there.\u201d 49 There is no need here to repeat that this is not the condition expected in an axial aligned system encased in a plasma sheath. And, as we have also noted, life can, and does, maintain and propagate itself in total darkness right here on Earth. So why do I even bring this up? I do so because a world with no seasons, or with but one season, is precisely what ancient man proclaimed to have been the case \u201cin the beginning.\u201d More than that, it is precisely what we find encoded in Earth\u2019s palaeontological remains.",

This means that not all of Earth\u2019s latitudes receive the same amount of direct radiation from the Sun at all times. Summer arrives in the northern hemisphere because Earth\u2019s axis during that time tilts the north pole toward the Sun (closest during summer solstice). In winter, it is the south pole that is tilted toward the Sun (closest during winter solstice). In between, during the equinoxes, both hemispheres receive the same amount of solar radiation because Earth\u2019s axis points neither toward nor away from the Sun. This also means that, in the southern hemisphere, the seasons are reversed, with summer coming in winter, autumn coming in spring, winter in summer, and spring in autumn. But, while all this is astronomically true, it is not necessarily always apparent down here on Earth. Thus, the fourfold seasonal division of the year can seldom be recognized in the annual cycle itself. In the Western World, the seasons have been calculated in accordance with the yearly cycle of cultivated plants: Winter as the season of dormancy, spring as that of sowing, sum- mer as that of growth, and fall, or autumn, as that of harvest. However, as we all know, spring and fall are merely transitional periods. Winter and summer are the only two seasons that have a distinctly extreme difference. Beyond that, seasonal temperatures pay no attention to the inclination of Earth\u2019s axis. Parts of spring can be as cold or as warm as winter or sum- mer, as so, also, can parts of autumn. Climate depends on shifting winds, themselves reliant on the evaporation of water, and also on the particular topography of the land. Thus, for in- stance, because Egyptian harvest was totally reliant on the inundation of the Nile, the ancient Egyptian year was divided into only three seasons\u2014akhet (inundation), peret (emergence), and shemu (aridity). The Hindus, on the other hand, reckon a six-fold division\u2014rtus: vasan- tika (spring), graishma (summer), varshika (rainy season), sarad (autumn), hima (early win- ter), and sishira (late winter), all of which, it is stressed, \u201coverlap one another.\u201d\u201d Seasons do not mean the same thing to everyone. The ancient Celts divided the year by religious festivals into four quarterly divisions without any concern for the solstices or equinoxes\u2014in other words without any recognition of the shortest or longest days.\u2019 These",

The coldest place in the Arctic is in the Yukon basin, shared by Alaska and the Yukon Territory, and the province of Yakutsk in Siberia where temperatures colder than 90\u00b0 F below zero \u201chave been reliably recorded.\u201d And yet, wheat, barley, oats and rye are cultivated \u201cif not at the very cold pole of the Northern Hemisphere, at least within a comparatively short distance from it, where the temperature frequently drops lower than 80\u00b0 below zero.\u201d\u00ae Antarctica, at the other \u201cend\u201d of the world, is entirely different. The mean monthly summer temperature at the South Pole is minus 28\u00b0 F. Rarely does the temperature rise above freezing and \u201conly here and there on the Antarctic coastline.\u201d In winter it can range anywhere",

In tropical latitudes, seasonal differences in weather depend on the shifting wind belts where the alteration of rainy and dry days is more important than temperature. Nor do these rainy and dry seasons necessarily correspond with winter and summer. In fact, places close to the equator can experience two rainy seasons and two dry seasons per year. The length and intensity of these rainy and dry seasons also depends on the relief of the land and exposure to winds from different directions. And yet, regardless of the time of the year, tropical rainy seasons are almost without exception cooler than the dry seasons. In most of India, the rainy season occurs in summer, the dry one in winter. Despite the Hindu calculation of the seasons, as mentioned above, India, like ancient Egypt, is con-",

The Rotumans, living on a small island near the equator, reckon the passage of time in periods of six months, or moons. Changes of temperature there are but slight, with the dif- ference of seasons barely perceptible. Not only can the natives observe no change of season, the vegetation itself is not materially affected throughout the year. So, likewise, in the Kings- mill Islands, also known as the Gilbert Islands, situated directly beneath the equator, where the natives reckon their \u201cyear\u201d as a period of ten months without any reference to seasons.\" It can thus be seen that, while the official seasons are tied to the astronomical calendar, actual seasonal variations, climates, and temperatures are not entirely dependent on Earth\u2019s axial tilt. All of which raises the question: Are seasons necessary for the propagation and sustenance of life? THE GOD OF SEASONS On an Earth engulfed in the semi-darkness of a perpetual dawn, bereft of the succession of day and night, with a radiating warmth reflecting uniformly, or quasi-uniformly, on all parts of our globe, our world could only have experienced a single season. The evidence for whether this was ever so can only be found here on Earth. But, before delving into that, because seasons would eventually have come about, our reconstruction of these primeval events demands that the mytho-historical record should connect the arrival of the four sea- sons with the Saturnian deity man had been wont to venerate. Can this demand also be met? We note, for starters, that the association of the word \u201cseason\u201d with Saturn is discernible in Latin. In fact, the English word \u201cseason\u201d is itself ultimately derived, through a meandering route of associated European words, from the Latin sationem, accusative satio, \u201csowing\u201d? According to the ancients themselves, it was this word, satio, and or satus, that is \u201cseed,\u201d from which the name of Saturn\u2014i.e., Saturnus\u2014was derived.\u201d And it is this, among other matters, which ended up casting Saturn as a god of agriculture. Hermann Collitz, on the other hand, traced the derivation of the name Saturnus to the Persian (that is Old Iranian) word xsaeta, with the dual meaning of \u201cbright\u201d and \u201cking\u201d or \u201cruler,\u201d!* which appears as an epithet of Yima/Saturn.\u2019* As he indicated, an older form of Saturnus, which was sometimes written Saeturnus, was Saetus. He was therefore convinced that the name Saeturnus derived from Saetus through the Avestic xsaeto/xsaeta\u2014which he",

Thus, in describing Saturn\u2019s Golden Age, Ovid spoke of mankind as having been \u201ccontent with foods that grew without cultivation\u201d in \u201ca season of everlasting spring.\u201d'\u201d It was only after Saturn\u2019s reign had come to an end that the springtime \u201cwhich had prevailed of old\u201d was shortened while \u201ca cycle of four seasons in the year, winter, summer, changeable autumn, and a brief spring\u201d was instituted.\"* And was it not because of this that Janus, whom we have already seen identified by the ancients themselves as Saturnus, was deified inter alia as the god of the seasons?\u201d It was no different in the New World where we have already met the Peruvian Kon Tiki Viracocha. Having previously identified him as a Saturnian deity, it is not surprising to discover that he was believed to have been the \u201cguiding power in regulating the seasons\u201d which seasons were actually ordained by him.\u201d Further north in Arizona, the Indians of Oraibi venerated a god called Machito who, like the Saturnian deity of other races, existed in darkness at a time when \u201cthere was no sun, no moon, and no stars.\u201d\u201d It is said that the people complained \u201cbecause of the darkness and the cold.\u201d\u201d While the cold mentioned here might seem to contradict our thesis, it should be understood that the record in question involves a protracted series of events covering a pe- riod which goes beyond what is encompassed in this work. This cold, of which the mytho- historical record has much to say, descended upon the world at the end of Saturn\u2019s Golden Age\u00ae\u2122 but before the appearance of the seasons. In fact, it was after Machito had produced the Sun, which dissolved the cold, together with the Moon and the stars, that he \u201cappointed times and seasons.\u201d\u2122 Much more can be said but, at this point, I must stop because we are now encroaching on the era of Saturn\u2019s Golden Age which actually came later and which topic must be reserved for its proper chronological place in the planned sequel to this volume. Even so, it behooves us to remember the words of Frederick Hall who considered the era with which we are presently concerned as having been \u201cthe primitive phase of Saturn\u2019s Golden Age.\u201d\u201d> As he wrote:",

Vegetation [was] lush, animals [were] plentiful and life easy for herbivores, carnivores and omnivore-scavengers, such as man, alike.\u201d\u201d\u00ae PHOTOPERIODISM Photoperiodism, not to be confused with photosynthesis, is the response of organisms to the duration of light and darkness generated by the succession of day and night. It should however be noted right from the start that temperature, nutrition, and environmental factors can greatly modify this response. Also, closely related varieties of species can, and do, re- spond differently to identical photoperiodic conditions due to inherited differences in their make-up. When it comes to fauna, the most conspicuous activities correlated to photoperiodism consist of changes in pelage and/or plumage, the migratory instincts of birds, and the repro- ductive process, each of which occurs with marked regularity at a particular time each year. When animals held in captivity are subjected to artificial lighting conditions which mimic a day-night succession that is different from the natural one, reproduction, bird migration, and other activities can be induced out of season. This seems to prove that such activities are regulated by the changing daily periods of light and darkness\u2014in other words by the succes- sion of the seasons. In artificial situations, as little as nine hours of light per day was sufficient for stimulating the physiological changes responsible for these activities. The response, it has been found, becomes rapid under long days, and sluggish under short ones. Thus, changes in physiological responses, such as change in breeding season, occurs in certain birds and mammals when transported from a southern to a northern latitude and/or vice versa. And yet, in equatorial regions, where day lengths are constant, mammals and birds continue to breed, change their plumage, and migrate as if the day lengths actually varied. Do they then keep count of the days? Can they keep time? Or is it that they have adapted so well to their envi- ronment that their physiology changes without response to photoperiodism? To be sure, studies of certain species of birds failed to show any influence of light on their reproductive cycle.\u201d\u201d Would animals not breed had there been no succession of day and night? Would they stop breeding in an environment of perpetual dawn and an everlasting spring? Or would they adapt? The flowering of plants, the formation of roots, runners, tubers, and bulbs are also controlled by photoperiodism. The photoperiodic reaction of plants takes place in the leaves, but the response occurs elsewhere. Not all plants, however, react the same way. Short-day plants, for instance, fail to flower when days exceed a certain duration; long-day plants fail to flower unless days exceed a certain duration. The critical day lengths for these plants, moreover, differ widely not only from species to species but also among varieties of the same",

What was not understood at the time the phenomenon of photoperiodism was named was that the response of plants is controlled by the duration of darkness and not of light\u2014that is by the length of the night as opposed to the length of the day.\u00a5 May we be bold enough to suggest that this might be a residue from an earlier environment in which the world was cast in perpetual semi-darkness? Red light can prevent the flowering of short-day plants while promoting that of long-day ones. However, the inhibition of flowering by short-day plants through red light can be prevented by the inclusion of red light of greater wave length (or what is known as far-red).\u201d Since Saturn is here posited to have been a brown dwarf star, its propensity of red light, mainly in the far-red, would therefore have been conducive to plant growth. On the other hand, as every gardener knows, some flowers close up at night and re-open when the Sun comes up. What, then, would have happened to such plants attempting to thrive in a world where the succession of day and night was replaced by a perpetual dawn-like murkiness? The answer is actually simple: Had such plants existed at the time, they would have had to adapt to their environment as others have done, and continue to do, in the present world. THE SUB-TROPICAL ARCTIC As early as the nineteenth century it was \u201cadmitted by all scientific authorities that at one time the regions within the Arctic Circle enjoyed a tropical or nearly tropical climate.\u201d These words were written in 1885 by William Warren in his attempt to prove that man\u2019s original Paradise had been located at Earth\u2019s north polar region.\u201d He did not assert this as merely his say-so; he named authorities and quoted from them. \u201cThe Arctic regions, probably up to the North Pole, were not only free from ice, but were covered with a rich and luxuriant vegetation.\u201d*! \u201cOne of the most startling and important of the scientific discoveries of the last twenty years has been that of the relics of a luxuriant Miocene flora in various parts of the Arctic regions. It is a discovery which was totally unexpected, and is even now considered by many men of science to be completely unintelligible...\u201d\u00b0? \u201cTn the early Tertiary period the climate of the northern hemisphere, as shown by the Eocene animals and plants, was very much hotter than it is at present; partaking, in- deed, of a sub-tropical character.

In the greater part of the Miocene and preceding Eocene epochs the fauna and flora of Central Europe were sub-tropical, and a vegetation resembling that now seen in Northern Europe extended into the Arc- tic regions as far as they have yet been explored, and probably reached the Pole itself. In the Mesozoic ages the predominance of reptile life and the general character of the fossil types of that great class of vertebrata indicate a warm climate and an absence of frost between the 40th parallel of latitude and the Pole...\u201d And yet, seeing as so much has been discovered since the nineteenth century, can we still adhere to these conclusions?

Although the relics of such forests are known from other parts of the world, those on Axel Heiberg are exceptional because, unlike other remains, they have not been petrified. On the contrary, the remains have maintained their original form and even tissue. The retrieved wood still splits and splinters and can be carved with a sharp knife. It burns as good as modern wood. It has even retained the hue of soft lumber. Not only trees have been preserved, but also leaf mats the likes of which one finds on the ground in modern forests. Barren, gaunt, and forbidding as the island now is, its rolling hills bear the traces of more than twenty separate forest layers, stacked on top of each other, all of which are found in situ, testifying to growth on the spot rather than transmission by the forces of nature.

The coal-bearing sediments of the Eureka Sound Group scattered throughout most of the Arctic Archipelago also contain such remains. Plants dated to the Paleocene from the Fosheim Peninsula of Ellesmere Island resemble similar Paleocene flora from Western Canada\u2019s interior, indication of a cosmopolitan temperate zone.\u201d Some of the plants from these Tertiary forests have been described as being akin to those growing in the present cypress swamps of Florida.\u201d Others, like oak, do not grow in swamps. Trees from the middle Eocene in the same area reached up to 50 meters high. The fossils of animals found buried amid the remains of these forests\u2014ancestors of the horse and rhinoceros, giant lizards, land tortoises, salamanders, snakes, alligators, crocodiles, flying lemurs*'\u2014all testify to the warmth of the climate at that time, as so does the discovery of fossil palm trees and huge exotic ferns by Soviet paleobotanists in the islands of Spitsbergen in the Svalbard archipelago far within the Arctic Circle.\u201d Even fossil tapirs, the descendants of which now live in the equatorial Amazon forest, were found on Ellesmere Is- land.* As Ian Johnson (not to be confused with Art Johnson, cited above) noted, finding the tropics in such high latitudes raises serious implications for paleontologists: \u201cThis far from the equator means 4 months of polar darkness...If the night tempera- ture was always 10 degrees Celsius, in conjunction with 4 months of darkness, plants would die. Mammals found to date are likely middle Eocene creatures. Crocodiles, lizards and turtles are well adapted to forest life but some of the discovered species [the crocodilians] cannot tolerate near freezing temperatures for very long. This im- plies that there had to be considerable warmth in the Eocene High Arctic all through- out the year.\u201d And: \u201cCrocodilians are a test of the reconstructed polar forest community because they have changed little since the end of the Triassic...the crocodilians have been consis- tent throughout their long evolutionary history in their limited tolerance of the cold.",

Crocodiles require shallow water, but crocodiles in water that is colder than 65\u00b0 F tend to sink to the bottom in lassitude and drown as they do in places even like Florida during severe cold weather. The scientific establishment, meanwhile, has not been entirely silent when it comes to propositions concerning the solution of the puzzle which the one-time existence of these Arctic forests raise. Thus, for instance, writers in New Scientist proposed that the Arctic Eo- cene\u2019s subtropical climate can be explained if the oceans transported far more heat to the poles than they do at present.\u201d But evidence of the atmospheric circulation required for this, which depends on temperature differential, is lacking. Moreover, the small size of particles retrieved from Eocene deep-sea sediments confirm the lack of wind speeds at that time.\u201d Continental drift must also be ruled out because Axel Heiberg Island is \u201conly a few hundred kilometres closer to the North Pole than it was when the forests flour- ished\u201d*\u2019\u2014which is definitely not enough for it to have been located outside the Arctic Circle at that time. As Johnson noted: \u201cModern geological field work has confirmed that the north- ern lands of the globe have been located in polar latitudes for at least the last 100 million years, despite ongoing continental drift.\u201d\u201d Leo Hickey\u2019s \u201cobservation\u201d that \u201cfossil leaf fragments indicate that the deciduous leaves were enormous\u201d has remained somewhat controversial.*' He, however, claims to have returned from his 1979 field season with fossil leaf fragments, one of which measured two feet in width.\u201d Gigantic leaves are known to develop when plants are grown under constant lighting conditions. Thus, his conclusion was that these forests \u201cgrew under conditions of continuous light.\u201d* Hickey then proposed that a bank of thick fog could have hung over the forests during the Arctic winter, which fog would have retained enough heat to cause a greenhouse effect. What would have caused the fog, or why such a fog is not at present evident in the polar regions, he left unexplained. Curt Teichert was honest enough to admit that \u201cattempts to explain rapid climatic changes throughout the Tertiary have been \u2018especially vexing and unsatisfactory\u2019.\u201d\u00ae As D. H.

But one has to keep in mind that if Saturn acted as the sun during mankind\u2019s primitive past, it must also have been Earth\u2019s sun during ages long before. Moreover, since Saturn\u2019s present illumination and heat are nowhere close to what we have postulated them to have been during man\u2019s early career on this planet, it stands to reason that its radiant energy dissipated relatively fast. This would also make us assume that, in ages prior to the advent of mankind, Saturn\u2019s radiant energy, and in fact even its mass, must have been greater still. It is even possible that its illumination, at close quarters to Earth, would have been bright enough to bathe the world in perpetual daylight rather than the constant dusk that primitive man later experienced. As we have seen, scientific consensus favors a dimmer sun during Earth\u2019s past geologic ages. Could not this dimmer sun have been the Saturnian sun which later greeted man\u2019s appearance on Earth? (What should also be kept in mind is that if our hypothesis is anywhere close to being correct, the dating of Earth\u2019s past geologic ages would be based on fallacious evidence.) FROM POLE TO POLE AND IN BETWEEN I have been stressing the discoveries in the Canadian High Arctic but, if the truth is to be known, similar evidence is available from other parts of the northern hemisphere. Oswald Heer described 2,632 Arctic plant species, 1,627 of which were actually discovered by him. In his seven-volume epic on the subject, published between the years 1868 and 1883, Heer stressed the luxuriant plant life that thrived during the Tertiary in northern polar regions. Among those that grew in Greenland, he noted magnolias and fig trees.* Similarly in Spits- bergen where he noted the Tertiary thriving of such trees as pines, firs, spruces, cypresses, elms, hazels, and even water lilies.\u201d Forests which once flourished in Spitsbergen have left seams of coal from twenty-five to thirty feet thick. Fossil specimens of fig palms and the gi- ant Redwood (Sequoia gigantea), which now grow in California, have been retrieved from an area stretching from the Bering Strait to north of Labrador. As D. H. Campbell admitted: \u201cIt is difficult to imagine any possible conditions of climate in which these plants could grow so near the pole, deprived of sunlight for many months of the year.\u201d\u00ae Fossil corals, which can only grow in tropical waters, were also discovered there in large formations. Corals, in fact, grew all over polar North America\u2014in Alaska, Canada, and even in Greenland.\u201d The same situation is evident at the opposite end of the world in the freezing regions of Antarctica. The biggest problem here is that, in past ages, Antarctica was warmer than the tropics and equatorial regions themselves by about 90\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\u201d Early in the twentieth",

Shackleton discovered seven seams of coal at about latitude 85\u00b0, each of which was between three and seven feet thick, testimonials to ancient forests which once grew where now not a single tree, not even a blade of grass, can grow.\u00ae The coal seams that run through the Transantarctic Mountains are some of the most extensive on Earth.\u2122 Sandstone, associated with this coal, was found to contain petrified coniferous wood.\u00ae Fossils from the Pliocene include well-preserved wood in the form of tree stems as well as roots together with the remains of marine life. (And this is to say nothing about fossil forests from even earlier eras found near the South Pole, when the climate believed to have prevailed at the time should not have allowed such growth.\u201d) In 1935, Admiral Byrd could write that: \u201cHere at the southernmost known mountain in the world, scarcely two hundred miles from the South Pole, was found conclusive evidence that the climate of Antarctica was once temperate or even sub-tropical.\u201d* The Eocene evidence of vast forests in the Antarctic has been attributed to a paleolatitude which was close to that of present Madagascar, while Antarctica is supposed to have still been drifting toward the pole.\u201d Continental drift can therefore be used to solve the mystery by those who adhere to this belief. Melvin Cook, however, is of a different opinion. Ac- cording to his findings, Antarctica \u201cappears not to have moved appreciably in continental shift\u201d since the continents which were once in contact with it \u201cleft Antarctica in radial directions,\u201d\u201d\u00b0 thus leaving it more or less in the same locality. Besides, as we have seen, the problem also involves the Arctic regions where, even according to orthodoxy, continental drift cannot save the day. But the enigma entails more than just Earth\u2019s polar regions; it also embraces the latitudes in between. Thus, from early in the twentieth century, many paleobotanists were convinced that \u201cduring by far the greater portion of time since the Azoic era, mild, benign climatic conditions have existed.\u201d\u201d According to Dolph Hooker: \u201cIt is also the concensus [sic.] that, astonishingly and inexplicably, such conditions were comparatively uniform over most of Earth\u2019s surface; that temperate climate extended both north and south to within the polar circles. It is also believed that, amazingly, seasonal effects during most of geological time have been much less pro- nounced than they are now.\u201d Writing in 1912, F. H. Knowlton stated that:",

How could Earth\u2019s po- lar regions been blessed with a sub-tropical climate while the rest of the world remained lit- tle, if at all, warmer than it is at present? As Barbara Bell admitted: \u201cIt is by no means clear that solar radiation sufficiently intense to keep the poles as warm as they appear to have been at times would not heat the tropics more than observations indicate.\u201d THE CRETACEOUS CLIMATE Continental drift, through sea-floor spreading, is an ongoing process. Christopher Scotese, a geologist, now predicts that, in another 250 million years, Great Britain will have been pushed to a near-Arctic locale, with the Atlantic Ocean having become nothing but a distant memory. Just as all land masses are believed to have been joined together, 250 mil- lion years ago, in a super-continent which geologists have named Pangaea, a new mega-con- tinent, already dubbed Pangaea Ultima, will by then have formed. Africa would have rammed Europe, uplifting the colliding edges in a Himalaya-like mountain range while eras- ing the Mediterranean in the process. The Atlantic Ocean would first widen, then reverse its course and finally close up completely.\u201d It is not, therefore, surprising that geologists and paleoclimatologists have tended to rely on this process to account for the moving of once-tropical areas into what are now the Arctic and Antarctic regions. As noted in the above report, Great Britain seems destined to do ex- actly that. As we have seen, however, continental drift cannot be made to account for the sub-tropical fauna and flora of the Tertiary period, the remains of which are now found within the Arctic Circle, for the simple reason that the Arctic regions were already close to their present location at the time.

As Richard Kerr noted: \u201cThe earth of the Cretaceous Period 100 million years ago was unaccountably warm, as it generally had been since the end of the last great ice age 140 million years ear- lier...\u201d\u201d \u201cExplaining Cretaceous climate has been difficult because it differed so from today\u2019s. Coral reefs for which warm water is essential ranged as much as 1500 kilometers closer to the poles than they do today, as did nonseasonal land plants. Deep ocean water that now hovers near freezing was 15\u00b0 (Celsius) warmer...Alligators and croco- diles seem to have thrived at latitudes as far north as that of present-day Labrador. And there is no evidence of any permanent ice like that which today deeply buries Antarctica and Greenland.\u201d\u2122 \u201cNot only was it generally warmer during the Cretaceous, but it was particularly warmer in the polar regions.\u201d*! Because the position of the continents during the Cretaceous would have been different from the locales they would have occupied later during the Tertiary, scientists continued to seek an answer to the riddle of the earlier climate via continental drift. This was not only be- cause the lands within the present Arctic Circle would have been farther removed from polar regions than they would have been during the following Tertiary, but also because the different continental configuration would have led to the development of an entirely different climatic regime. It was thus reasoned that: \u201cContinents bunched in low latitudes near the equator, as Cretaceous continents tended to be, would allow warm ocean currents to carry heat poleward. High-latitude polar oceans, being less reflective than land, would also absorb more heat and further moderate climate.\u201d Eric Barron and Warren Washington therefore decided to test this hypothesis by recreat- ing the Cretaceous climate through the use of a computer model.\u00ae Others followed suit.* There is no point in tracing the ups and downs of these various attempts and the disagreements between them.

This evidence comes from tree rings. As every Boy Scout knows, tree trunks are marked out in transverse section into concentric rings, one ring for each \u201cseason\u201d of growth. In order to tell the age of a felled tree, Boy Scouts are taught to count the number of rings laid out in its trunk. Known as annular rings, these growth marks owe their emer- gence to differences in the elements at the beginning and end of each growing period. Fossilized trees from various past ages show distinct annular rings. Others do not. Wood retrieved from late Paleozoic deposits in the southern hemisphere has been said to show pronounced ring growths. So, also, fossils of deciduous trees from the Cretaceous. In fact, fossilized wood samples ranging all the way from the Devonian to the Eocene have been claimed to show well marked annular rings. The scientific literature on this subject, however, is very ambiguous. More recent work has tended to show that rings are either lacking or very weak in all known specimens from the Devonian period which seems to indicate a non-sea- sonal environment. Most fossil trees from the Carboniferous period, which followed the De- vonian, also lack rings. As Elso Barghoorn noted: \u201cOne impressive indicator of uniform climate over great areas of the Carboniferous continents is the great absence of annual growth rings in coal-swamp trees. The entire question of ring development in woody plants is one fraught with botanical variables as well as climatic variables. However, the consistent absence of any index of sea- sonal growth seems difficult to explain except on the assumption that winter cold and seasonality of rainfall were absent or at a minimum.\u201d By the time we come to the late Permian period, still within the Paleozoic era, we end up with a mixed bag. Fossil woods from Canada, Europe, and Asia have weak or non-existent rings, while those from South America, Africa, and Antarctica show prominent and wide growth rings. A mixed bag from trees growing in different areas may be expected. But what about a similar mixed bag from trees known to have grown in the same locality? Thus, mov- ing slightly closer to our time, we come to the Triassic period of the Mesozoic era. Few fossil",

One specimen from this collection lacks annular markings, but others display very wide prominent rings. In samples from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods of the same Mesozoic era, as well as from the Early Tertiary period, tree rings range from prominent to non-existent, depending on the paleolatitude in which they are claimed to have thrived. When it comes to polar fossil plants, as Edward Berry noted: \u201cDetailed comparisons of these Arctic floras with contemporary floras from lower latitudes...show unmistakable evidence for the existence of climatic zones...\u201d C. P. Brooks reached the same opinion, claiming that climatic zones existed in the Eocene,\u201d as so did Ralph Chaney, who pushed the margin up to the Pliocene.\u201d As Jane Francis noted, samples of wood collected by her on Axel Heiberg Island showed clear annular rings over a quarter of an inch wide. And, because the darker latewood added at the end of the growing season featured very narrow bands, the conclusion has been drawn that the trees grew rapidly during the twenty-four hour sunshine period of the Arctic summer and then closed up shop during the winter hours of darkness.\u201d The problem with this, however, is that trees would not have survived such prolonged periods of darkness. And then there is the fauna to consider. What\u2014did tapirs and crocodiles sleep through these darkened months? Could land tortoises have migrated to warmer climes? Besides, where did the warmth that would have been needed to thaw the Arctic ice cap come from? The present Sun is not capable of accomplishing that feat. And if the Sun, as accepted by orthodoxy, had been dimmer in those eras, it would have been able to accomplish it even less. Or are we to believe that sub-tropical flora and fauna existed in an ice-bound region, and for millions of years at that? But how, then, do we get out of this dilemma?

All of which forces us to ask yet another ques- tion: Are annular rings really indicative of seasonality? Actually, annular rings are only formed in those plants whose growth is interrupted by a regular winter or dry \u201cseason.\u201d The increment of new wood formed in these trees is marked by a distinct line which is produced by the contrast between the late summer of one year and the spring of the next. The lines of separation between successive rings marks the limit of a microscopically thin layer of cells, known as the cambium, which lies between the wood and the bark, at the end of each successive growth period. The bark then cracks and/or expands to allow for the new growth of wood, and the tree trunk is thus thickened. It should be noted, however, that the cambium responds mainly to conditions of temperature and rainfall rather than the incidence of light. In temperate climates, the cambium produces new wood only during spring and early summer. It becomes inactive during autumn and winter. But what about trees growing in tropical and equatorial regions where seasonal differences disappear? Do they still grow rings? As it happens, many kinds of evergreen tropical trees do not grow rings.\u2122 But others do. As Barghoorn reported: \u201cIn existing woody plants, annual ring development may occur under nearly uniform climatic conditions, as in equatorial rainforests.\u201d\u00b0* What, then, is it in this seasonless environment that tells these trees that a year has passed and that it is time to grow more wood and thus form a new ring? That the growth of annular rings is not tied to seasonal change is evidenced by the fact that some trees have been known to grow as much as three or four rings in one year. Nor is this an uncommon situation, as Nelson Glueck noted, especially in trees which grow on sloping ground that turns wet and dry several times in one year because of rapid outflow of water.\u201d According to an item in Nature magazine, multiple rings in larch trees were normal in 1919; in fact, larches seem to be prone to multiple ring growth.\u201d Meanwhile, trees which miss growing a ring in certain years have also been known.\u201d As Herbert Sorensen pointed out: \u201cIn dry and climatically harsh years, no detectable growth may occur. In this case no ring is formed and the ring is missing for that season of the year.\u201d\u201d",

        "main_text": "In some cases, as much as five percent of the rings may be missing.'\u00ae In fact, growth rings are lacking in a majority of trees which thrive in subtropical and tropical climates while others fail to grow rings regardless of climate. What all of this declares is that tree rings are poor indicators of seasonal change. In fact, let us be honest about it, they are not indicative of seasonal change at all. But if tree rings do not indicate seasonal change, what, then, do they indicate? We have already noted above that the cambium responsible for the growth of trees re- sponds mainly to conditions of temperature and rainfall rather than the incidence of light. And, in fact, when it comes to the growth rate of trees, water is the limiting factor. In other words, water is the one true constituent which limits the growth of cambium and thus the formation of growth rings. This is what tree rings, when they grow at all, truly indicate\u2014a cycle dictated by the availability and cessation of an adequate water supply \u2014which is pro- bably what Ian Johnson meant by \u201cordinary seasonal growth cycle\u201d as opposed to \u201ca polar seasonality.\u201d Only in the most indirect way can tree rings be said to indicate seasonal change when they do so at all. That being the case, the lower incidence of light from the Saturnian sun, as compared to the higher incidence from our present Sun, would have posed no obstacle to the growth of trees. Temperature would also have posed no problem because, while the Saturnian sun would not have been as hot as our present Sun, its proximity to Earth would have compen- sated for its lower caloric output. As we have seen, it is quite apparent that trees grow rings, or fail to grow rings, regardless of seasonal change or stability. More importantly, if trees can, as they do, grow rings in tropical and equatorial regions in which there is no appreciable seasonal change, what is so problematic with having trees growing rings in a sub-tropical Arctic which enjoyed but one spring-like season? Paleobotanists remain hard-put to account for the growth of sub-tropical forests and the existence of sub-tropical animals within the Arctic Circle. Uniform heat and light, to say nothing of the absence of an ice cover, would have been required for the flourishing of such forests and the thriving of such animals. THE AXIAL TILT HYPOTHESIS Why not simply straighten Earth\u2019s axis? This, too, would have ensured a world with one season, an eternal spring. And as difficult as it might be to later tilt Earth\u2019s axis to the angle it now holds, it seems more feasible than any of the hypotheses we have so far proposed. This, in fact, had been suggested by various authorities at the end of the nineteenth century as, for instance, by Julius Hann: \u201cThe simplest and most obvious explanation of great secular changes in climate, and of former prevalence of higher temperatures in northern circumpolar regions, would be found in the assumption that the earth\u2019s axis of rotation has not always had the same position, but that it may have",

But, as James Croll pointed out: \u201cA continent ten times the size of Europe elevated two miles would do little more than bring London to the latitude of Edinburgh, or Edinburgh to the latitude of London.\u201d!\u201d This debate involved some of the giants of science that lived at the time, including William Thomson (better known as Lord Kelvin), George Darwin, Simon Newcomb, and Giovanni Schiaparelli,'\u201d the latter of whom wrote: \u201cThe permanence of the geographical poles in the very same regions of the earth can- not yet be considered as incontestably established by astronomical or mechanical ar- guments.

B.

Beyond stating my firm belief that the cosmic catastrophes described in Worlds in Collision were unfortunately displaced in time by Velikovsky, the present work has nothing to offer concerning the possibility of terrestrial axial shifts during historical times. My main interest, here, concerns the much earlier Tertiary period. In this respect it is noteworthy to note that when, in the 1980s, remains of sub-tropical flora and fauna were discovered by So- viet scientists in Spitsbergen, the axial tilt hypothesis was revived and, as of this writing, continues to be the standing Russian (previously Soviet) understanding of what had to have transpired in ages past.'* \u201cIn the early 1980s, scientists proved the far North had once been a tropical paradise.

To conform with thermodynamics, and an Earth tilted 23 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic [as at present], these environments had to be considerably closer to the equator. If they were closer to the equator, then either continental drift occurred both much more rapidly and mysteriously than the geologi- cal record indicates, or else the Earth has tilted or experienced crustal slippage in some fashion that allowed warming of these lands without disrupting the continuity of equatorial rainforests. Another mechanism has the Earth with little or no tilt to its axis of rotation, which removes seasonality and ensures light each day on each point of the globe, coupled with a dense canopy that allows much more even temperatures despite variation in latitude.\u201d\"\u201d\u201d According to Bernard Delair, theoretically, Earth ought to rotate on a vertical axis \u201cand may actually have done so in the geologically recent past.\u201d\u2019\u201d\u00b0 And: \u201cThere ought to be no reason why any Earth-like planet undisturbed for untold ages should not have a vertically- positioned axis.\u201d!! Unfortunately, there are various problems with the axial tilt hypothesis. To begin with, Delair\u2019s declaration did not go unchallenged. As Michael Reade pointed out, \u201ca spinning ball forced to traverse an elliptical orbit around a primary would adopt a tilted attitude.\u201d As he, in turn, assured his readers, \u201cit is never possible to get a free-spinning ball to spin with its axis either vertical or horizontal: the principal axis of the ball always settles to a well-defined and seemingly invariable angle of tilt.\u201d This, as Reade pointed out, \u201chas long been known to engineers: spinning bodies, such as turbines or speed governors, impose asymmetric stresses on their shaft bearings.\u201d\u201d\u201d True, as Jane Francis noted, had Earth\u2019s axis been perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, the Sun would have bathed the polar regions with twelve hours of light every day. At the poles, however, the Sun\u2019s rays would have been weak and low-angled, similar to those experienced just before sunset. And this would have been insufficient for the growth of plants such as the remains of which have been discovered in polar regions.'\u201d Why not then propose a model which would combine both theories? Would not a perpendicular Earth orbiting around the Sun with Saturn stationed at Earth\u2019s north celestial sphere fill the bill? Not really because, for one thing, this would be contrary to what the my- tho-historical record has to tell us. We have seen that, time and again, the record states that, during the age of semi-darkness, the Sun was not yet visible. And there is no point in ap- pealing to the Pleiongaea hypothesis to account for this invisibility. Had sunlight managed to",

And in order for the Sun to have been entirely shielded by an impenetrable terrestrial atmosphere, its substantiality would have had to have been denser than that of Venus. Ven- erian-like pressures at Earth\u2019s surface, let alone an even greater burden, would not have al- lowed the survival of terrestrial mammals including the human race. At bottom lies this additional fact: While the axes of the Solar System planets point in different directions, those of Saturn and Earth come close to coinciding. Saturn is tilted at 26.7 degrees while Earth\u2019s tilt is at 23.45 degrees.'* Both axes point to about the same spot in space. Saturn\u2019s present north star is the same as Earth\u2019s\u2014Polaris. This is a situation that would be expected had Saturn and Earth once shared the same axis of rotation as our main thesis demands. What this seems to indicate is that, despite Delair\u2019s assurance to the contrary, Earth\u2019s present axial tilt is the most natural one for it to possess, and that it has not changed since at least the Tertiary period. What then of a perpendicular axis with an Earth in phase-lock outside the Solar System as posited by Ken Croswell for red dwarf planets? This, too, fails to fill the bill because, as we have already noted, while Croswell\u2019s theoretical system would entail a world without variable seasons, it does not occasion one universal spring-like climate. True enough, the climate would not have been variable, but tropical and equatorial regions would still have been much warmer than the poles. The poles, in fact, would have been the recipients of low slanting rays and if such slanting rays from our own Sun would have been inadequate to allow the thriving of sub-tropical flora and fauna at the poles, neither would the slanting rays from a red or brown dwarf star. What if we were to adapt Croswell\u2019s phase-locked system by having it encased within the totally warm plasma sheath we have already postulated for the proto-Saturnian system? Light and warmth would then have reached all latitudes in equal proportion without having to rely on an axial alignment, already posited as the most difficult mechanical configuration to maintain. In other words, why not adopt Wallace Thornhill\u2019s scenario wherewith Earth was in just such a positional situation and that it only \u201cbroke\u201d into polar alignment when it entered the Sun\u2019s influence? This, then, would make the Saturnian system\u2019s axial alignment a mere transitional event, which would be more amenable to celestial mechanics. As already claimed, the encasing of the proto-Saturnian system in a plasmasphere is our accepted tenet. In the end, however, it may even be found that both postulates\u2014a denser atmospheric envelope and a plasma sheath\u2014are quite compatible with each other since a denser terrestrial atmospheric envelope might have existed within the Saturnian plasma sheath. We would thus have a situation in which the light and heat from the proto-Saturnian sun would have been reflected back, or otherwise radiated outward and inward, from the plasma sheath and dissipated evenly through the greenhouse property of Earth\u2019s denser atmosphere.",

This theory also explained the resemblance noted by Heer of the Tertiary flora of Europe and the Re- cent flora of eastern Asia and Atlantic North America.\u201d'? As Johnson noted, while Heer\u2019s theory dates to the late 19th century, his \u201cnotion of an Arctic evolutionary cradle is startlingly modern, in line with the work of Dawson and Hickey\u201d'\u00ae to which we shall come anon. E. C. Pielou, on the other hand, reminded her readers of photoperiodism which presents an \u201capparent obstacle to long, northward and southward migration of plants\u201d since such migrations would have moved said plants out of their physiological niche.\"* Long-day plants, for instance, cannot survive in the tropics, while short-day plants cannot thrive in more northern latitudes. This is because the photoperiodic length varies from latitude to lati- tude and from season to season. Because day and night lengths in the tropics approximate twelve hours each all year round, photoperiodic variations are small to non-existent. In the mid-temperate regions, photoperiodic spans can vary from up to nine hours in December to up to sixteen hours in June. In the present Arctic regions, photoperiodicity drops to zero in December, rising as high as twenty-four hours in June. All this, however, would have been of very little, if any, importance during the Tertiary if Earth had basked under a continuous and universal sub-tropical climate and light regime as seems to be indicated by the evidence presented above. In the case at hand, the climatic requirements would have been close to identical the world over. Migrating plants would not have had to vacate any physiological niches; they would merely have radiated into new areas the climatic properties of which would have been near identical to the ones of their origin. In the end, it is the available evidence that counts. Does the evidence support the theory of a Tertiary plant migration from the Arctic into more southerly latitudes? We have seen above that Johnson claimed that Heer\u2019s nineteenth century theory of just such a migration is in line with the modern work of Dawson and Hickey. What have these two authorities to show us?",

But, further south, the tapir was found in a Middle Eocene context, while the flying lemur appeared in an Early Eocene stratum.'*\u00b0 Meanwhile, Leo Hickey, who had already spent twenty years studying Eocene flora, came to the conclusion that plants, together with marine invertebrates, had risen earlier in the Arctic than in the mid-latitudes. Ancestors of the horse, camel, rhinoceros, land tortoises, together with the flying lemur, and such trees as the Mexican elm, walnut, and the redwood, originated millions of years earlier in the polar regions.'\u00b0 \u201cDawson and Hickey in the early 1980s co-authored a paper in Science where they argued that certain plants show up in the fossil record 18 million years earlier in the Arctic than elsewhere while some animals evolved 2 to 4 million years ahead of their time north of the Arctic Circle.\u201d!\u201d An alternative way in which the theory of Pleiongaea could be brought in line with the Saturnian model is if Earth\u2019s dense atmospheric envelope exhibited a north polar clearing\u2014a hole if you wish. This would bring our thesis perilously close to that advocated in 1886 by Isaac Newton Vail,'* propounded further by his modern defender, Donald Cyr'\u201d and, in a different but slightly similar vein, by Dolph Earl Hooker\u2019 plus, to a certain extent, even by Milton Zysman.\"\" All of these authors\u2014from whom the present writer disassociates him- self\u2014have proposed a terrestrial canopy of sorts, although not all of them have included the polar opening. Meanwhile, such a polar opening in a planet\u2019s atmosphere is not all that for- eign in the Solar System. Venus has such a polar opening \u2014a \u201chuge hollow\u201d 1,000 kilometers wide\u2014in its own dense atmosphere right over its north pole, through which the Sun might possibly be shining.\u2019\u201d If such was the case, the Saturnian sun, complete with its nebular disk, would have been clearly seen through the opening. More than that, it would have warmed Earth\u2019s Arctic regions even more effectively. Unfortunately, a lamentable objection has to be raised against this hypothesis since, as we have already seen, the proximity of the proto-Saturnian sun would have raised Earth\u2019s atmosphere in a tide precisely above Earth\u2019s north polar region. Thus, if a Pleiongaea-like atmosphere did prevail, it would have lacked a polar opening. In the meantime, what Hickey and Dawson\u2019s discoveries seem to demand is a north polar sun emplacement exactly as hypothesized in this volume. Thus, in addition to a universal climatic regime which would have warmed Earth throughout all its latitudes, a direct radiant +85 H.

From the 1940s to the mid-1950s, for instance, Ting Ying Ma was involved in the study of corals which led him to declare that the position of the equator (and, therefore, also of the poles) had shifted from one geologic age to another.! What did these studies involve? Very much like trees, corals grow rings which are believed to indicate a cycle of seasonal growth; in winter, coral cells grow small and dense, whereas in summer they grow larger and more porous. Ma noticed that the rates of total annual growth in corals in identical, or simi- lar, species increased with proximity to the equator, while seasonal variation in growth rates increased with distances from the equator. This enabled him to correlate coral growth with latitude, which furnished him with a technique for investigating Earth\u2019s ancient climates. It also led Ma to two related conclusions: (1) That seasonal change was clearly indicated in the oldest geologic periods, and (2) that the latitudinal temperatures of the past had been about the same as at present. If this is correct, a world without seasons, as proffered in the preced- ing chapter, could not have existed. What all of this conveyed to Ma was that, in the past, the position of the equator had changed from one geologic period to another and that none of these coincided with the pre- sent equatorial position of land. One of these earlier equators was even found to have bi- sected the Arctic Ocean. The mechanism for this displacement was then attributed to a sliding of the lithospheric shell over Earth\u2019s liquid core, like the loose skin of an orange sliding around its fruit. Ma, however, could not match earlier equators in one hemisphere with corresponding ones for the same period on the opposite hemisphere in order to derive a complete circle. He therefore had to assume that continental drift was also involved and that it was this independent shift- ing of the continents which had thrown the ancient equators out of line. These combined displacements, of which Ma could deduce four separate events, were, according to him, sudden in execution and all in the same direction. He calculated them to have taken place during the last million years with the last readjustment having been com- pleted 65,000 to 2,800 years ago. Ma was as courageous in advocating continental drift as much as he was in proposing a wholesale shift of the lithosphere. Beginning as early as 1861, the theory of continental drift",

It was then revived, thanks primarily to S. W. Carey, in March of 1958, at a symposium on the subject that was held at the Univer- sity of Tasmania. In the early 1960s, a cause was eventually tendered by Harry Hess who submitted that the upwelling of magma through immense rifts, or faults, in ocean bottoms was capable of carrying the \u201cfloating\u201d continental plates with them as the magma spread to both sides of the rifts.

Where the spreading ocean bottom meets the edge of another conti- nental plate, it is subducted back into the interior, wrinkling the continental edge and uplift- ing it into mountain ranges in the process. The theory has now become dogma, proving sound Ma\u2019s utilization of it at a time when it was still anathema to do so. On the other hand, the second half of Ma\u2019s theory, concerning the wholesale shifting of earth\u2019s lithosphere which, in any case, was the brainchild of Hugh Auchincloss Brown,\u201d remained in dispute. Ma\u2019s theory is thus left reliant on his coral evidence. How valid is this? First of all, as Thomas Stephenson warned in 1959, long after Ma had conducted his studies of corals, older accounts concerning the process of coral formation \u201cshould be read with reserve, since the ideas in vogue on this subject have until recently been largely specu- lative\u201d and \u201ctoo much based on the study of the skeleton.\u201d \u201cIt is obvious that the skeleton is merely an imperfect if permanent record of the ac- tivities of the polyps, and study of the latter reveals the fact that in some cases at least conclusions as to the manner of growth, drawn from the skeleton, may be entirely er- roneous.\u201d4 Granted that Stephenson was mainly concerned with the growth of coral reefs, the same can be said of older accounts pertaining to the growth of the polyps themselves, as indeed Stephenson makes clear when he refers to more recent studies by Matthai in relation to the formation of coral polyps.> Now it has long been known that corals are restricted to tropical and sub-tropical zones despite the fact that, in \u201ccertain past epochs,\u201d coral reefs \u201chad a far wider distribution than is now the case, their remains being plentiful in latitudes at which they cannot now maintain themselves.\u201d\u00b0 Thus, while Ma\u2019s shifting latitudes could explain coral remains out of present tropical and sub-tropical climes, it has nothing to offer regarding their overall much wider distribution. The growth of corals requires an average annual water temperature of no less than 70\u00b0 F. The polyps themselves, however, are insensitive to light. But \u201ctheir endodermal tissues con- tain myriads of microscopic one-celled algae\u201d which thrive \u201conly in the presence of strong light.\u201d This makes for a highly successful symbiotic relationship since \u201cthe corals rely on the algae to absorb their waste products.\u201d? Thus, both warmth and strong light are necessary for the successful growth of corals and coral reefs. The biggest problem with Ma\u2019s evidence, however, concerns the period of time repre- sented by a single coral reef which, at most, can be said to bridge a few thousand years, hardly enough to embrace a single geological period. Thus, for instance, as reported by Charles Hapgood: \u201cAt Pago Pago harbor borings were made down to the basalt underlying the reef, and after estimates of the growth rate were arrived at, the age of the reef (Utelei) was es- timated at 5,000 years. When these spans are compared with those of entire geologi- cal periods of the order of 20,000,000 or 30,000,000 years, it is clear how fragile must",

What was worse for Ma, however, was the fact that he was not able to offer a cause for these wholesale movements of the crust. THE ICE CAP MODEL In the late 1950s, Hapgood picked up the topic of polar wandering due to Earth\u2019s sliding crust and made a reputation for himself as the theory\u2019s foremost advocate.? Hapgood was able to trace the pole\u2019s shift from the Yukon to the Greenland Sea around 80,000-75,000 BP; from the Greenland Sea to Hudson Bay around 55,000-50,000 BP; and from Hudson Bay to its present location around 17,000-12,000 BP.!\u00b0 (Three concurrent paths and positions were also given for the south pole.)!! Needless to say, these polar shifts cannot account for the sub-tropical flora and fauna that thrived within the Arctic Circle during the Tertiary and preceding eras which have been dated to millions, rather than Hapgood\u2019s few thousand, years. Besides, the shifts proposed above would not have brought sub-tropical regions into the Arctic Circle; they would merely have shifted latitudes by about 30\u00b0 which, today, would be like moving Winnipeg and Vancouver to the latitude of Ellesmere Island. Hapgood was of course aware of this but, as he had to admit, it would be \u201cfutile to try to determine the location of the poles in the more remote cases\u201d since with \u201cevery step back- ward in time the evidence naturally becomes thinner.\u201d !2 Even so, despite the scarcity of evi- dence, what the totality of Hapgood\u2019s theory proposed is that the region which is now within the Arctic Circle would have earlier been closer to the equator, which would account for its sub-tropical flora and fauna, before it shifted to its present location. A neat package, as Al- bert Finstein himself had to admit. '3 Originally, Hapgood had contended that the cause for this crustal slippage would have come about because the accumulation of polar ice is not symmetrically distributed about the poles. This maladjusted dispersion was thus believed capable of producing a centrifugal mo- mentum which was then transmitted to the rigid crust. As this centrifugal force increased, Earth\u2019s crust tended to slide over the viscous layers underneath. (This theory, the brainchild of Hugh Auchincloss Brown,!4 has also been maintained by others including Edward Weyer.!5) But, although Einstein himself was at first receptive to this idea,!\u00a9 he later ex- pressed strong doubts about it, as so did Kirtley Mather.!7 The biggest problem here is that masses situated at, or very close to, the poles produce minimal centrifugal effect.

Without necessarily discrediting Ma\u2019s deductions, Hapgood\u2019s results are not concurrent. Within the past 80,000 years, Hapgood believes that the location of the north pole has changed three times in shifts lasting 5,000 years [as compared to Ma\u2019s four displacements in the last million years]. The north pole, according to Hapgood, has been in its present location for 12,000 years [as compared to Ma\u2019s 65,000 to 2,600 years ago].20 (Compare these figures to those deduced by Auchincloss Brown: 41,800 years ago; 18,400 years ago; 11,400 years ago; with the last shift occurring 7000 years ago.?!) Nor, in- cidentally, do Hapgood\u2019s shifts all occur in the same direction as Ma\u2019s. \u201cThus,\u201d as Ellen- berger had to conclude, \u201cEarth\u2019s shifting crust, if such it is, appears to leave contradictory clues.\u201d 22 Hapgood\u2019s theory was kept alive by his followers, who often disregarded his retraction concerning the \u201cice-cap mechanism,\u201d?3 as also by those who found it useful for their own special brand of hypotheses concerning Earth\u2019s ancient past.24 (Even some of his detractors seem to have been unaware of Hapgood\u2019s retraction.?5) But can poles really shift? THE TOPPLING GLOBE Thomas Gold certainly thought so. He was not, however, concerned with the wholesale shifting of Earth\u2019s crust as much as he was by the actual toppling of the globe. Writing in 1958,?6 Gold stressed the fact that \u201cthere is no general physical law that prevents a body from turning over with the aid of internal forces only.\u201d27 \u201cThe general law of the conservation of angular momentum merely prohibits a change of the value and direction in space of the body\u2019s angular momentum unless",

Had it been a perfect sphere, it would tend to topple over, time and again, allowing it to tumble all over the place. Earth\u2019s spin, together with its equatorial bulge, turns our world into a gyroscope. A shift in mass would therefore alter its orientation. The amount of adjust- ment, however, is dictated by the globe\u2019s capacity to deform. Without such distortion, Earth\u2019s axis would at best have been capable of shifting by less than one degree throughout all past geologic ages. Thus Gold was forced to ask: \u201cBut is it reasonable to assume the earth is stiff enough to maintain its shape over long periods?\u201d2? As Gold points out: \u201cThe present shape of the earth would not be the right one for a dif- ferent speed of rotation.\u201d3\u00b0 And yet it has been assumed that Earth\u2019s rotation \u201cmay have al- tered drastically in the past.\u201d 3! This would mean that Earth would have had to readjust to the correct shape in order to maintain its equilibrium in space. In turn, this would also mean that Earth \u201cmust be capable of a certain amount of plastic deformation.\u201d 3? If, then, a large mass was to develop at some intermediate latitude between the pole and the equator (as opposed to one at the pole as originally proposed by Hapgood), Earth\u2019s natu- ral balance would change, its axis would shift, and the world would have \u201cto adjust its shape accordingly\u201d until the extra mass finds its way to the equator.33 For one thing, however, masses cannot develop out of nothing. And, even if they could, as Gold himself admitted, the very plasticity that would allow Earth to topple \u201cwould actu- ally let the extra mass sink in, and the unbalance would therefore disappear.\u201d34 How, then, did Gold get out of this situation? He did so by proposing that existing land masses like mountain chains, even though par- tially sunken, or floating, at different depths in the plastic material below, could change their height, and so also their center of gravity, through erosion or diastrophism. This, too, ac- cording to him, would produce an imbalance which would have to be corrected by an ad- justment of earth\u2019s shape. Earth would then topple over gradually until it achieves a new stable rotational axis.35 Gold also believed that it is possible for Earth to have experienced polar shifts without having undergone continental drift; but continental drift could not have occurred without po- lar wandering. Basing his assumptions on Walter Munk\u2019s calculations, Gold came to the conclusion that a period between 10 and 100 million years would be required for Earth to turn over by about 90\u00b0.36 The time involved would be well within the span of Earth\u2019s geologic past. Gold also considered the wholesale shifting of Earth\u2019s crust, in lieu of axial toppling, as it had been considered by others before him. But while Gold believed this to be dynamically possible, he argued that such mechanism would still require \u201ca degree of interior plasticity that would itself allow a yet more rapid turning over of the entire earth\u201d since an \u201cinterior so",

GEOID HIGHS Writing many years later, and basing his conclusions on a model of Earth\u2019s interior that was itself at odds with the received opinion of his time, Don Anderson did not quite agree with Gold\u2019s objections as they relate to a wholesale slipping of Earth\u2019s crust. While received opinion held that Earth\u2019s crust was homogeneously undifferentiated, Anderson claimed that Earth is really \u201ccompositionally stratified, with the crust, mantle, and core being the most obviously chemically distinct shells.\u201d3% \u201cA chemically layered, gravitationally stable mantle would be the natural end state of the earth\u2019s evolution. The presence of a crust and a core...indicate that differentiation or separation is the dominant large-scale process, whereas convection can be expected to homogenize the layers between chemical discontinuities.\u201d29 This led him to conclude that the convection of Earth\u2019s mantle, rather than being steady as believed in by orthodoxy, is episodic and driven by \u201clateral temperature gradients caused by continental insulation.\u201d\u201c Thus, in his opinion: \u201cActive subduction and stagnant continents generate geoid highs [that is an area of higher density causing imbalance], which reorient the mantle relative to the spin axis.\u201d4! As he pointed out: \u201cIf the earth is deformable, the whole mantle should wander relative to the axis of rotation, but the implications of this are seldom discussed.\u201d4? And: \u201cCuriously, earth scientists have been more reluctant to accept the inevi- tability of true polar wandering than to accept continental drift, even though the physics of the former is better understood.\u201d \u201cContinents move away from thermal highs [or hot-spots] and come to rest over cold parts of the mantle; sea-floor spreading and subduction slow down or cease until the subcontinental mantle warms up. The whole mantle shifts relative to the axis of rota- tion to accommodate the changing geode.\u201d# Needless to say, in such a scenario, Earth\u2019s outer shell would be stressed by its migration over the equatorial bulge (and/or the migration of the equatorial bulge itself). \u201cThe outer layers of the mantle, including the brittle lithosphere, do not fit properly on a reoriented earth.

To use Anderson\u2019s own words: \u201cGlobal reorientation may be responsible for initiating rifting [of continents] and subduction and periods of rapid apparent polar wandering.\u201d *\u201d \u201cThe rotation axis [i.e. the pole] has apparently wandered about 8\u00b0 in the past 60 mil- lion years and 20\u00b0 in the past 200 million years. During these periods there have been major changes in the configurations of continents and subduction zones. These appar- ently had minor effects on the principal moments of inertia, suggesting a relatively stable and slowly evolving geoid. Even a slowly changing geoid, however, can cause a rapid shift in the whole mantle relative to the spin axis if the moment of inertia along this axis becomes less than some other axis of inertia. This may have happened sometime between 450 and 200 million years ago...\u201d48 According to Anderson, large-scale 90\u00b0 shifts can however also occur. As he continues to tell us, at present, the rate of polar wandering \u201cis much greater than the average rate of rela- tive [continental] plate motion,\u201d and it would have been \u201cfaster still\u201d in ages past.4? What is more important to our study: \u201cWhenever there was a major continental assemblage in the polar region surrounded by subduction as was the case during the Devonian through the Car- boniferous, the stage was set for a major episode of true polar wandering.\u201d The southern continents, according to him, \u201call underwent a large northward displacement beginning sometime in the Permian or Carboniferous (280 million years ago) and continuing to the Tri- assic (190 million years ago).\u201d5! If this was so, areas which were once south of Earth\u2019s polar regions, together with their fauna and flora, would have moved toward the polar regions. But, limiting ourselves to the last 60 million years (which would bring us to the Tertiary), a shift of 8\u00b0, as expressed by Anderson, would not have been enough to shift sub-tropical areas into the polar circles, and the sub-tropical faunal and floral remains of the high Arctic would remain unsolved. THE PALEOMAGNETIC EVIDENCE It is well known that Earth\u2019s magnetic pole and its geographic pole, that is its axis of ro- tation, do not coincide; at present they vary by 11\u00b0. More than that, Earth\u2019s magnetic field, and therefore its magnetic pole, is known to wander, having moved several hundred miles to the north in the twentieth century alone. It has however been posited that, over a period of a few thousand years, the field returns to its original position \u201cand that the average position of the magnetic pole over the whole period will coincide with the earth\u2019s axis of rotation.\u201d>?

This \u201cfossilized\u201d magnetism occurs when iron-bearing rocks are molten and then quickly cool, thus trapping the orienta- tion of Earth\u2019s field at the time of cooling. Known as paleomagnetism, the orientation of the field can be deduced if and when the original position of such rocks can be determined. If, then, the age of such rocks can also be deduced, the orientation of the field, and so the local- ity of the old geomagnetic poles, can also be dated. When this was accomplished, it became evident that the geomagnetic poles must have wandered over the terrestrial surface. More importantly, the parameters enumerated above allows the path of the magnetic pole to be traced through the ages and plotted on a map. Jean Andrews, among others, was able to trace this path for the past 180 million years which she dutifully plotted on just such a map.4 Andrews\u2019 research led her to the conclusion that \u201cthe whole earth (or at least the mantle and the overlying lithospheric plates)\u201d has (or have) tumbled.\u00b0> The cause for this, according to her, is the same geoid highs offered earlier by Anderson which cause an imbalance due to mass redistribution on Earth\u2019s surface.*\u00b0 This mechanism, which had been offered by others before her,*\u2019 is explained by Andrews through the following analogy: \u201cImagine a homogeneous plastically deformable sphere rotating in space. A dot is painted at the rotation axis, the sphere\u2019s north pole. If a bug placed on the equator crawls sufficiently slowly (with respect to the time scale of plastic deformation) to- ward the dot at the pole, it will in fact never leave the equator defined by the spin axis. Rather, the sphere will tumble, with the dot moving toward the bug, while the rotation axis remains fixed in space.\u201d 8 Of course, following Anderson, Andrews was sure to note that Earth is not a homogene- ous sphere while the equatorial bulge would tend to stabilize Earth and keep it from tum- bling. As she herself, however, retorts: \u201cNevertheless, the pole can shift through a large angle, even with only a small mass redistribution, as long as the bulge is \u2018plastic\u2019 and not \u2018frozen\u2019.\u201d\u00b09 Andrews\u2019 findings delivered such an impact that the editors of Scientific American pre- sented her hypothesis as fact.60 Even so, the question has to be asked: What is the cause of geoid highs and mass redistribution? What causes these areas of higher density? Together with his colleagues, R. Sabadini is of the opinion that mass redistribution is the result of mantle flow instabilities,\u00b0! which is not really saying much. Of more importance to our own hypothesis, however, is the actual path of the magnetic pole traced by Andrews for the last 180 million years. The three localities of the former",

All three of them, as well as the rest, are within the Arctic Circle\u2014that is these ancient magnetic poles were already within the Arctic Circle at the times supplied by Andrews. So that, even if her plotting is correct, all this pole-wandering would still not resolve the problem concerning the existence of sub-tropical faunal and floral remains within the High Arctic regions. As with Hapgood\u2019s earlier paths, the most extensive of these polar wanderings would merely have shifted the latitude of Winnipeg close to that of Ellesmere Island. Somehow, I cannot see crocodiles, lemurs, and palm trees thriving in the present latitude of Winnipeg. Thus, as with other theories of polar wandering, these pole shifts would still have fallen short of moving sub- tropical areas into the Arctic Circle. And then, how valid is a theory based on the hypothesized link between Earth\u2019s geomagnetic pole and its axis of rotation? As already noted, Earth\u2019s geomagnetic pole is separated from its axis of rotation by 11\u00b0. Nor is it even fixed\u2014it wanders around. In Jupi- ter\u2019s case, the tilt of its south pole does coincide with its geomagnetic one; but at the north pole, the geomagnetic and spin axes vary by 10\u00b0. That of Uranus is tilted a walloping 59\u00b0 from the planet\u2019s axis of rotation.\u00a9? This was at first thought to be due to the fact that Uranus is tilted on its side. Neptune, however, is not lying on its side and yet its magnetic field is also tilted a walloping 47\u00b0 from its axis of rotation. \u00a9 It cannot therefore be an inviolable law that geomagnetic poles should coincide with, or otherwise be linked to, geographic ones, that is axes of rotation. True, Saturn\u2019s magnetic field is closely aligned with its spin axis\u2014being separated by less than 1\u00b0\u2014but this seems to be unique among the planets of the Solar Sys- tem. Moreover, Saturn\u2019s magnetic field is stronger at the north pole than at the south (0.69 gauss as opposed to 0.53 gauss), which is equivalent to the centre of the field being displaced 2400 km north along the planet\u2019s axis. (Whether the anomaly of this magnetic field has meaning for the thesis proposed in this work remains to be seen.) Earth\u2019s magnetic field is said to be produced by a dynamo effect involving its molten core within the rapidly spinning planet. This mechanism, however, only seems to work in Earth\u2019s case. The core of a small planet like Mercury, for instance, would have cooled off long ago; its spin is nearly 60 times slower than Earth\u2019s. For these reasons, Mercury was be- lieved not to have a magnetic field. And yet, as it was ultimately discovered, it does. As Clark Chapman was forced to state: \u201cIn the case of Mercury, more than a decade of subse- quent thinking about Mariner 10\u2019s discoveries has still not yielded a clear understanding of what\u2019s going on inside the planet.\u201d Only in the case of Mercury?\u2014one might ask. Take the case of Venus, for instance: If a slow spinning planet with a cold core, like Mercury, can generate a magnetic field, then Ve- nus, much larger and with molten iron in its core, should, despite its slow spin, also generate a magnetic field. How is it then that its magnetic field is close to being non-existent? Mars does not only have a weak magnetic field, it is said to be fading. At first, this mag- netic field was thought to swing wildly from one spot to another so that future \u201cBoy Scouts on Mars won\u2019t be able to use compasses to get around...\u201d But it was later discovered that the pattern of the detected magnetism, imbedded in surface rocks, is not so jumbled after all. More than that, the magnetism in these rocks is said to be \u201c40 times stronger than similar ar-",

Why then is its present planet- wide magnetic field 1/500th the size of Earth\u2019s?\u00ae These anomalies have led Michael Zeilik to state that the entire concept is \u201ca magnetic mess.\u201d6\u00b0 Or, as David Stevenson was honest enough to confess: \u201cplanetary dynamo theorists have yet to be able to predict anything about planetary magnetism...\u201d7\u00b0 Up until the early 1980s, the verdict of NASA authorities was that the \u201cnature of the source of planetary mag- netic fields still remains one of the principal unsolved problems of geophysics.\u201d7! To date, nothing new has emerged to invalidate this verdict. The problem here is that if planets follow the same law, why such a potpourri of mag- netic fields? If the dynamo theory cannot account for the magnetic field of all the planets, on what grounds can it be theorized that it accounts for that of Earth? In the end it can safely be said that what Andrews really plotted was the positions of past geomagnetic poles. Can it positively be surmised that these past positions ever coincided with Earth\u2019s axis of rotation? Besides, as is well known, and as noted above, Earth\u2019s present magnetic pole is even now wandering on its own. So what need have we of crustal slippage to account for past magnetic polar wandering? THE MARTIAN ARCHETYPE In presenting his own version of polar wandering, Don Anderson had also drawn atten- tion to the other planets of the Solar System\u201d and zeroed in on Mars. He discussed what he termed the \u201clargest known positive gravity anomaly on any planet\u201d which is associated with the Tharsis volcanic area on Mars. According to received opinion, this mass anomaly has served to reorient the planet with respect to its spin axis.\u201d Almost two years later, Peter Schultz took up the topic in the pages of Scientific American. Among other matters, Schultz pointed to ancient networks on the Martian surface which are believed by some to have been cut by running water and flowing mud, which suggests a warm climate. And yet these areas are found within 10\u00b0 of the southern polar ice cap. This paradox, says Schultz, \u201ccan be resolved by one simplifying hypothesis, namely that the ori- entation in space of the Martian crust has not always remained the same throughout geologic time\u2014that the crust has shifted with respect to the planet\u2019s axis of spin.\u201d 74 \u201cTf such is the case, the north and south poles (the points where the spin axis inter- sects the surface) would appear to have wandered over the planet\u2019s crust; certain re- gions of the crust that are now far from the poles would at some time in the past have been within the polar regions...[Thus] the Martian equivalent of plate tectonics might",

Features that are normally characteristic of the poles should also be visible outside the polar regions.\u201d 76 The polar networks said to have been eroded by running water and/or mud, indicative of a warmer climate, as mentioned above, constitute such traces. But there is more: \u201cTf the Martian pole has wandered, there should be evidence elsewhere on the planet of deposits similar to those at the present poles. Such evidence does indeed exist. Thick deposits of dusty material, and relics of such deposits, can be found in two broad zones outside the polar regions. These zones are antipodal: they are on opposite faces of the planet. The deposits show many of the processes and characteristics of today\u2019s poles, but they lie near the present-day equator.\u201d\u201d Additional support was discovered by both Schultz and Anne Lutz from an \u201cunexpected source.\u201d Images of the Martian surface relayed by the Viking Orbiter in 1976 \u201cshowed an unexpectedly large number of elliptical craters with distinctive blankets of ejected debris.\u201d78 Experiments have since indicated that, \u201cbecause of the high velocity with which objects strike Mars...such craters form only when the angle of impact is very low...\u201d7? While such grazing impacts are known on other bodies of the Solar System, the number of such impres- sions on Mars \u201cis from five to 10 times greater than what has been predicted on the basis of theory and what is observed on the moon.\u201d8\u00b0 What this additionally indicates, at least in the opinion of Schultz and Lutz, is that these grazing impacts could not have been caused \u201cby randomly arriving objects that had been in orbit around the sun.\u201d8! \u201cThe observations can be understood, however, if one assumes the orbits of ancient Martian satellites decayed gradually until the satellites struck the planet\u2019s surface. If these satellites had orbited Mars in the equatorial plane, as the satellites Phobos and Deimos do today, the geographic location and direction of impact of a crater should establish the location of the poles at the time the satellite struck... \u201cThe polar points that can be inferred from the youngest grazing-impact craters do indeed match the locations of the present-day poles. Older impacts indicate polar points that cluster far away from the present poles and quite close to the ancient lay- ered deposits found near the equator.",

Other evidences are cited by Schultz,\u00ae but it is not necessary in this short excursion to describe, or even enumerate, all of them. Suffice it to say that Schultz, as also Lutz, were satisfied that polar wandering had indeed taken place on Mars.\u2122 As Schultz stated in conclu- sion: \u201cThe hypothesis that the Martian poles have wandered is supported by a good deal of evidence, and it offers new explanations for many of the planet\u2019s enigmatic features.\u201d85 What was the mechanism offered by Schultz to account for this Martian polar wandering? The mechanism he offered was a reversion to Anderson\u2019s proposed method concerning \u201cthe redistribution of mass within a planet or on its surface.\u201d8 His supposition is that: \u201cThe sta- blest alignment for a spinning object is the one in which the most massive parts of the object are farthest from its axis or rotation.\u201d87 \u201cWhen geologic forces place a large mass at or near a planet\u2019s surface at a point far from the equator, the spinning motion of the planet becomes unstable, like the un- stable motion of an improperly balanced bearing or top. If the planet is not entirely rigid, the crust shifts to move the anomalous mass toward the equator. As the crust of the planet shifts, the spin axis retains its alignment in space and the poles wander over the planet\u2019s surface.\u201d 88 Even so, Schultz was astute enough to submit a caveat: \u201cIf the lithosphere of the planet is very flexible, polar wandering does not take place, because any excess mass sinks into the surface before the crust has had time to rea- lign itself. There can be no polar wandering on a completely rigid planet either, be- cause the lithosphere cannot realign itself at all.\u201d89 This, then, would seem to invalidate Anderson\u2019s theory re the cause behind terrestrial wandering as discussed above and with which we are actually concerned. The case of Mars is somewhat different in that the planet\u2019s lithosphere displays both rigid and flexible features. There are ancient lava-filled basins that have been partly isostatically compensated together with volcanic and tectonic regions which have not been compensated at all. Schultz\u2019s own conclusion, as it applies to Mars, is that the \u201cchange in mass distribution that is necessary to produce polar wandering could have been provided by convection in the mantle (the rising of hot sections and the sinking of colder ones), by a redistribution of mass due to the impact of large objects or by the filling with lava of the resulting impact basins.\u201d \u201cConvection in the mantle\u201d would not, however, induce polar wandering on Earth for the simple reason that, as Schultz himself warned, \u201cany excess mass\u201d thus produced would tend",

LAST INTERLUDE A study of paleoclimates conducted in 1959 by J. Wyatt Durham zeroed in on what has now become something of a litany to the readers of this work: \u201cThe occurrence of palms and other types of tropical vegetation in northern latitudes where temperate or frigid climates now hold sway; the finding of elephants and rhi- noceroses frozen in the ice of Siberia; and the occurrence of tropical types of shells and corals in Europe: these were the kinds of fossils that caused speculation as to the conditions under which they had lived and that usually led to the conclusion that a tropical or \u2018warmer\u2019 climate had existed where they were found.\u201d92 Yet, having reviewed the evidence he had at hand at the time, Durham could only con- clude his study with the following confession: \u201cThere seems to be no general agreement as to the causes of climate variation. Alter- nating intervals of high and low topographic relief of the earth\u2019s surface, variation in heat due to internal radioactivity of the earth, changes in the composition of the at- mosphere, variation in radiation from the sun, astronomical and cosmical changes, presence of large amounts of volcanic dust in the earth\u2019s atmosphere and variations in circulation patterns are some of the causes that have been evoked to explain the changes.\u201d Durham could have added the theories of polar wandering and the shifting crust, to say nothing of axial tilts, to his list; his conclusion would not have been affected. More than four decades later, paleoclimatologists and paleontologists remain in a quandary as to the actual mechanism that would have caused tropical and sub-tropical flora and fauna to thrive in what are now the two coldest areas on Earth. Does not our own hypothesis which posits the Saturnian sun, a former brown dwarf star, to have been permanently stationed in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole, bathing the northern re- gions, especially the Arctic circle, with constant light and heat, more readily fill the bill? Would not such a milieu account for the sub-tropical plants in the Arctic which, in tum, fed the sub-tropical animals that thrived within the same region? Would not such a system, en- cased in a plasma sheath, with perhaps an Earth possessing a denser atmosphere than at pre- sent, have also ensured a sub-tropical climate in all latitudes, including Earth\u2019s south pole? Would not this also account for the growing consensus among paleontologists that such sub- tropical flora and fauna originated in the Arctic from where they extended themselves farther south? Wandering poles would not then be called for; neither would a shifting crust or a tilting of the axis.",

We are also aware that this supposition is open to the greatest criticism.\u201d Since then, I have continued to refer to the Saturnian system, model, and scenario as be- ing bizarre in the extreme. The problem did not merely consist of the fact that there were no such coupled bodies known from anywhere in the Universe, let alone in the Solar System; it also consisted of the supposition that celestial mechanics, as then known, would not allow for such a coupling. An added problem was the fact that, in the 1970s, neither of the two main proponents of the Sat- urn theory, David Talbott and myself, were experts in celestial mechanics. Thus, when John Gibson asked Talbott in an interview whether he thought that any astrophysicist could possi- bly accept the Saturn theory, Talbott replied with the words: \u201cAs a matter of fact, I\u2019m going to go ahead...and not even worry about the physics of it all. Let\u2019s face it: within any established frame of thought the whole thing is hilari- ous. How could two planets rotate on the same axis in any stable configura- tion...Does that sound like something one could defend in any terms acceptable to modern astronomy?\u201d3 And, when Gibson came close to insisting that Talbott \u201cshould suggest some physical principle which might account for the planetary configuration\u201d he was describing, Talbott emphatically replied with: \u201cNo, absolutely not.\u201d And added: \u201cThat would only make things worse. I\u2019m not a physicist.\u201d4 Not happy with Talbott\u2019s decision to avoid any attempt to solve the problem, I decided to accost some orthodox authorities with this mechanical conundrum. Five of them promised to look into the matter despite their obvious disbelief, although they all compelled me to keep their names out of the literature, at least until such time as their endeavors showed any",

Since I have never been released from this pledge, I remain unconditionally bound to safeguard their identity and reputation to this day even though, as of this writing, they have all passed away but one. Over the years some calculations petered in but, without exception, they all involved some amendment of the model they were meant to quantify. This was not much help since no problem can be solved through its own modification. The answer to a question is unaccept- able if the question itself is altered. When I pointed this out, I was lectured on the scientific method and told I was being stubborn. In the end, the verdict was that my model was physi- cally impossible. The argument that Wegener\u2019s model of shifting continents was also once thought to be impossible went unheeded. My five staunch mechanists deserted me, leaving me with a pile of impressive calculations that explained everything except what I had wanted them to explain. BOLD ENDEAVORS Throughout the years there were various bold endeavors, and even a few competing theo- ries, all vying to resolve the axial and other dilemmas of the Saturnian, or Saturnian-like, configuration. There would be no point, however, in detailing these efforts although fairness demands that they should at least be mentioned. Among those with a competing theory was the analytical chemist, Frederic Jueneman, whom we have met on several occasions in the past pages of this work. Contrary to the thesis being presented here, Jueneman opted for the planet Mars as having been the immobile bo- real sun of which the mytho-historical record speaks.> There was also Earl Milton, a spectroscopist working out of the department of Physics at the University of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. Having already questioned the presently ac- cepted tenets of astrophysics, he did not see the axial coupling of Earth with proto-Saturn as an insoluble problem but simply as one concerning a scheme with which he did not entirely agree.\u00a9 This was not to be wondered at because he, also, had been working on a model of his own. This was based on a scenario reconstructed by his colleague, Alfred de Grazia. Unfor- tunately, while de Grazia acknowledged the universality of the mytho-historical record, he showed a distinct penchant for using Greek sources as the yard-stick against which to meas- ure his cosmic scheme. Thus, de Grazia saw it as imperative to accommodate the Greek gen- eration of gods in which each deity was considered to have been the offspring of the preced- ing one. In following Immanuel Velikovsky, who had interpreted the birth of Athena from the head of Zeus as the actual ejection of the planet Venus from the planet Jupiter, de Grazia deceived himself into believing that, similarly, the ejection of one planet from another has to be implied by all such divine births.\u2019? And Milton, unfortunately, followed suit. This resulted in a hypothesized sequence of planetary fissionings and ejections\u2014 Uranus and Saturn from what Milton and de Grazia termed super-Uranus, Jupiter from Saturn and, finally, still fol- lowing Velikovsky, Venus from Jupiter.",

Although still purportedly based on the content of the mytho-historical record, some of them did not even involve planets!!\u00b0 None of these had any light to shed on the problem of Earth\u2019s axial coupling with Saturn. Meanwhile, from the very inception of his model, Talbott had opted for the planet Jupiter having attained a position \u201cabove\u201d Saturn, in line with Saturn and Earth, but not in axial alignment with them. According to this scheme, Saturn and Earth would have rotated on their single axis \u201cextending out from Jupiter.\u201d This would have meant that, from the vantage point of Earth, Jupiter would have been hidden behind Saturn and thus not visible to Earth-bound observers. !! Right from the start, the above scheme did not sit well with me because I had not come across anything in the mythic record that could be made to account for this hidden aspect of the planet Jupiter or any god identifiable as such. And, as of this writing, Talbott has yet to present the evidence on which he continues to base this particular hypothesis. I, on the other hand, had toyed with the idea of placing Jupiter at the other end of the con- figuration with Earth stationed in between the two giant planets. Thus Jupiter would have ap- peared stationary in Earth\u2019s south polar sky. Such a configuration, or so I reasoned at the time, would have lessened the instability problem since Earth would have been gravitationally attracted to both giants without succumbing to either. !2 This idea had been fed fuel by a few mythological tidbits which name the planet Jupiter as the Star of the South. Thus, in the Persian Bundahish it is stated how the \u201cseven chieftains of the planets have come unto the seven chieftains of the constellations\u201d where the planet Jupiter is matched with the constellation which the ancient Persians called Vanand.!3 Elsewhere in the same work, Vanand is described as \u201cthe chieftain of the south,\u201d!4 which would make Jupiter the planet of the south. In Hindu astro-mythology, Brihaspati, which is the Sanskrit name for the planet Jupiter, !> is also linked \u201cwith the fire of the south.\u201d!6 In Egyptian astronomy of the Ptolemaic period, the southern stars were held sacred to Horus !7 who, as Heru-Up-Shetau!8 and/or Heru-pe-sheta (Heru-ap-sheta and/or Heru-ap- sheta-taui), was one of the names of the planet Jupiter. !9 In fact, among other things, Horus",

Sherrerd had no apprehension about stating that such a planetary system was \u201cnot only plausible but likely.\u201d He considered that a linear configuration, with Jupiter and Saturn at one end and Earth in the middle, \u201cis a feasible and stable arrangement according to well-known principles of modern physics.\u201d23 Further research on my part, however, indicated that deities other than those identified as the planet Jupiter were also associated with the south. For instance, the Mexican gods Tez- catlipoca and Huitzilopochtli are both designated as rulers of the south.?4 These two deities, however, fit the role of Mars better than they do that of Jupiter,25 very much as Velikovsky had earlier surmised.26 Worse still, in Roman mythology, Jupiter, like Saturn, was associated with the north rather than the south.\u201d It thus became apparent that Jupiter\u2019s claim to the south, as also, incidentally, his claim to the north, had to do with something entirely different (concerning which, in order to keep events in a chronological order, I will have to write in a subsequent volume). I was therefore left with no recourse but to abandon this line of investigation. Due to lack of editorial concurrence, Sherrerd\u2019s paper was never published. Nevertheless, the barbell formation theory refused to go away. So much so that, in 1988, Talbott, too, thought it prudent to pay it some notice. As he wrote: \u201cMore than one physical model, in order to preserve stability (or at least a semblance thereof), would suggest a line up of planets in the fashion of a tumbling barbell, with the larger orbs balancing the two ends of the planetary assembly and the Earth locked in polar alignment between them. On this theoretical principle I can express no opin- ion, though applying the principle to the mythically-supported planetary line-up does yield some interesting results.\u201d*8 But since Talbott had alrerady opted for Jupiter\u2019s locality behind Saturn, he ended up by suggesting the introduction of yet one more planet.

It may be significant, however, that the concept would seem to support the suggested relative positions of the planets...While this does not answer the question as to what large planets might have balanced the other end of the barbell (for which question myth offers no help), the logical candidates would surely be first Neptune and then Uranus.\u201d?\u00b0 This, in turn, was picked up by Frederick Hall, a retired engineer from the Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory: \u201cProto-Saturn [he wrote] is not alone. In the fashion of a binary system, it is accom- panied by the smaller Neptune, except Neptune is not stellar.\u201d3\u00b0 Robert Driscoll, a physicist from Caltech, did not seem to give Neptune\u2019s participation in the Saturnian configuration any thought. Whether he already knew of Sherrerd\u2019s theory which had suggested Jupiter as the other member of the barbell formation, or whether he came to this tentative conclusion on his own, I have no way of knowing. But it is the Saturn- Jupiter barbell formation that he saw fit to analyze through a series of mathematical-physical equations.3! This was encouraging, to say the least, because, for the very first time since those physicists I had accosted earlier, someone had attempted to quantify the solution to the co-axial quandary inherent in the proposed Saturnian system. But even here, there were still some problems. According to Driscoll, the Saturnian system came into being within the Solar System it- self when an unnamed gaseous super-giant went through nuclear fissioning, thus instigating a series of minor calamities resulting in aerodynamic drags, shrinking and rounding of orbits, electric charges, cancellation of gravitational attractions, centrifugal forces, the combined influence of which resulted in Earth being captured between Jupiter and Saturn.32 That, in brief, was Driscoll\u2019s theory. There would be no point here in presenting it in more detail and/or reproducing its attendant equations since these would be beyond the com- prehension of most of my readers.33 Seven years later, Driscoll returned to the topic in a longer paper in which he not only considered the barbell model with Earth captured between Jupiter and Saturn, but also, and mainly, Talbott\u2019s original, and still adhered-to, prototype in which Jupiter is placed behind Saturn. In this attempt, the aerodynamic forces relied on previously were eliminated, with the stability of the system now more heavily dependent upon the Sun\u2019s gravitational attraction.*+ While I welcomed its greater detail and additional equations, I was less happy with this version than I was with Driscoll\u2019s earlier attempt. Nor did a still further, but much shorter, paper by him, with yet more equations, add anything substantially new to his theory.3> Talbott\u2019s model, in which the co-axial Saturnian system is made to orbit Jupiter equatori- ally as a rigid rod, received something of a dubious boost from the structural dynamicist, Robert Grubaugh, who specialized in placing satellites into orbit.%\u00b0 In this scheme, the two",

Several calculations were performed by Grubaugh to \u201cdemonstrate that the alignment is feasible according to the laws of Newtonian gravitation, and that the magnitude of torque necessary to produce the required precession is within the realm of possibility.\u201d Once again, it is not necessary to reproduce these calcula- tions here and interested parties are asked to consult the original documents cited. While no other physical model of the Saturnian configuration had until then received as much attention as Grubaugh\u2019s proposed model did, it had its ups and downs. In the end, even Talbott, at whose instigation Grubaugh had patterned his hypothesis, discovered a flaw in Grubaugh\u2019s model, although it was not one affecting his calculations. What Talbott real- ized is that, physically verifiable as it may be, Grubaugh\u2019s model did not conform to his own scenario as he had constructed it on the basis of the mytho-historical model. This problem was also picked up by Wallace Thornhill.4! Worse than that, Thornhill also found fault with Grubaugh\u2019s system, and therefore, to an extent, also Talbott\u2019s, as a whole.*? In 1999, Emilio Spedicato, physicist and head of Mathematics at the University of Ber- gamo, Italy, next applied his hand to the problem.* Like others before him, he, too, produced an impressive array of equations which, at least numerically, were found to be in agreement with the Saturnian polar model. But, like others before him, he also envisioned the system as having resided within the Sun\u2019s sphere of influence. Nevertheless, Spedicato did manage to show that, at least mathematically, the co-axial system would have been stable even under Newtonian constraints. He could not, however, vouch for the length of time the stability of the system could have prevailed. A year later, Spedicato teamed up with Antonio Del Popolo, an astrophysicist who was then also at the University of Bergamo, in a further attempt to quantify the inherent stability of the proposed Saturnian co-axial system and, more importantly, to see how long the system would have remained stable. To the chagrin of some, the obtained results from the equations involved did not confirm the required sustained dynamical stability of the model.45 On the contrary, it was found that the stability of such an axially aligned system would be lost \u201crather fast, with its maximum duration corresponding to only about 3 months\u201d when its \u201cexpected stability should extend at least over several thousand years.\u201d4\u00a9 Spedicato and Del Popolo did, however, concede that:",

His main criticism centered on what he deemed to be the gargantuan cataclysmic destruction on Earth that would have resulted during and after the break-down of the Saturnian system.*\u00b0 What remained curious about Ashton\u2019s recantation is that, despite all his objections, he did not discard the Saturnian model or its accompanying scenario. How could he when he himself had spent hours of research, especially in Sanskrit literature, and reams of paper,*! in successfully verifying the model\u2019s basic premises?> In fact, in a 1987 paper of his which, as of this writing, has not yet seen publication, he stressed his belief that the so-called Saturnian apparition from which \u201cthe metaphors of myth\u201d can retrospectively be derived can be con- sidered the very bedrock of myth.*? But then, reverting to the old canard that the identifica- tion of deities with planets is late, he convinced himself that the Saturnian apparition, as it might have appeared in man\u2019s ancient sky, had nothing to do with planets. Apart from the fact that this is verifiably untrue, he seems to have forgotten that, in many instances, ancient records speak specifically of planets besides their corresponding deities, as shown in earlier pages of this work. Even so, if not planets, what? What was it that Ashton believed was re- sponsible for the so-called Saturnian apparition? I quote directly from the paper concerned: \u201cTo abandon the planetary and retain the north celestial polar aspect of the primeval gods allows for an open and unbiased approach to the question of whether there was ever any original physical basis for mythical conceptions. Until the thesis set forth in the course of this essay receives some measure of physical verification, it is still eas- ily conceivable that the material of myth is due to subjective, visionary, psychic, mystic, metaphysical, cryptic, subliminal, or, if one can stomach the idea, occult fac- tors. This may be true no matter how neatly mythical motifs coalesce into one com- posite image retrospectively, and no matter how well the archaeological finds...may seem to attest that coalescence.\u201d 55 He was, however, obviously unhappy with this so, in lieu of it, he did forward a physical model of sorts, one which turns out to be even more bizarre than the planetary model he no longer espoused.

It must be visible in the same form to people scattered over wide areas of North America and Eurasia. | therefore propose a hologrammatic phenomenon of polarization of light of stratospheric particles which is manifested only at certain points in a series of inten- sities of solar radiation at harmonically related electromagnetic frequencies. \u201cAt an appropriate intensity, the radiation at various frequencies is in a proper mutual relationship, and the hologram is brilliantly lighted. It is seen in essentially the same form from points of viewing thousands of kilometres apart. It appears to be in the ro- tational polar space. It constitutes the central feature of the sky. The complete visual assemblage of it is that lost ancient sky which was radically different from what we now associate with the sky.\u201d5\u00b0 In order to circumvent the problem raised by the invisibility of this hologrammatic appa- rition in the present sky, Ashton proposed that \u201cbetween the activating intensities of solar ra- diation, there is an interference phenomenon which [now] blots out the polar apparition.\u201d5\u201d He even provided \u201ca hypothetical instance of how this might work\u201d*8 but, as he made clear in 1999, the entire exercise becomes irrelevant since he himself eventually disavowed it all. As he then wrote: \u201cIn \u2018The Bedrock of Myth,\u2019 as yet unpublished, I explain why, by content of myth alone, I reject the role of planets in the Polar Assemblage, which I think may well have been objective, but for which I failed to propose a plausible model.\u201d\u00b0\u00b0 One should recommend Ashton for his honesty but, since he continues to believe that what he terms the Polar Assemblage was the very bedrock of myth, and since he now admits that the hologrammatic model he had previously advanced cannot be considered plausible, what is he left with to explain the apparition he continues to believe in? Knowing Ashton for the intelligent man he is, it remains my personal opinion that he jumped off the planetary Saturnian ship a little too hastily and much too early. All of the above attempts, noble efforts one and all, suffered through similar problems and, in one respect, by one and the same difficulty. All of them, in one way or another, were burdened with items which are contrary to what the mytho-historical records demands, and/or with items which, at best, are not contained within that record. To be fair to all con- cerned, most of those who had thus far attempted to solve the axial problem inherent in the Saturnian configuration were in something of a peculiar situation in that the Saturnian sce- nario had not yet been gathered together in chronological sequence in any one place. Worse than that, not all of the events, with their celestial interactions, and their consequential out- comes, had till then received treatment. Nor can the present work alleviate that problem be- cause, while a chronology of sorts is here being attempted, the history of the Saturnian sys- tem contains too many constituents, and too many events, only a few of which have so far been touched upon, to be told in one short volume. Add to all that the additional problem the above theoreticians encountered in that they were already faced with slight disagreements between the main proponents of the thesis, and one can well understand the shortcomings of their attempts. The one difficulty with which they all strained, however, was in their location of the Sat- urnian configuration within the bounds of the Solar System. This encumbered their theories",

This mass would not have been involved, at least not initially, in our alternative scenario where the co-axial Saturnian system would have originally sustained itself far away from the Sun\u2019s gravitational and/or electromagnetic influence. And this should not be wondered at because, despite Juer- gens\u2019 original concept regarding the extraneousness of the Saturnian system, the theory had not yet received much publicity. Besides, as Talbott himself was astute enough to recognize, until all the mythological chips are in their correct place, theories concerning the astronomical workings of the Sat- urnian system must remain hypothetical at best. As he had it stated: \u201cWhat I will argue for is that the search for physical explanations have at its highest priority reckoning with the full implications of myth, wherever a definitive consensus is indicated. As more information is brought to the discussion this will require a con- tinued willingness to reconsider previous speculations\u2014with no qualms about modi- Sying or even abandoning earlier frameworks .\u201d\u00a9 THE LESSON OF SHOEMAKER-LEVY 9 The problem then becomes even more obvious because, despite the internal consistency of the mytho-historical record, our theory continues to demand an astronomical solution. As already noted, there are no bodies in the present Solar System which are linearly aligned. Worse than that, present Solar System theories, based on purely gravitational forces, even with the refinements introduced from lessons learned through the detection of extra-solar planets, do not seem to allow for celestial bodies to be so aligned. But then, in July of 1994, Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, which taught us more than one lesson, plowed into Jupiter. The most important message writ large by this impact was more of a warning than any- thing else. It taught astronomers, once and for all, that Earth is not the safe haven they had previously believed it to be. If a comet could collide with Jupiter, as this one did, chances of a similar collision with Earth could not be as far-fetched as once believed. Geologists, of course, had long recognized the scars left behind by previous terrestrial impacts, but these had always been pushed beyond the reaches of the present into the dim horizon of a long- gone past. Until recently, and despite the devastation it caused, even the impact of a fireball\u00ae in the valley of the Tunguska River in northern Siberia, in June of 1908, failed to alert as- tronomers to the dangers of cosmic impacts. Shoemaker-Levy 9 accomplished what the Tun- guska fireball failed to do. It sent entire nations on a world-wide program designed to keep track of near Earth-grazing objects, such as errant asteroids, in an attempt to forewarn hu- manity of any impending cosmic-induced catastrophe\u2014even though no one seems certain of how to avoid the calamity if and when such a time comes. The second lesson learned from the impact of Shoemaker-Levy 9 had to do with the na- ture of comets which, for years, had been touted as being mainly composed of ice\u2014\u201cdirty snow-balls,\u201d they have been called, or \u201csnowy dirtballs,\u201d as some jocularly termed them.

The third lesson, the one with which we are mainly concerned here, had to do with the manner in which the fragments lined up after the comet broke up. To be sure, Shoemaker-Levy 9 had already fragmented when it was first spot- ted close to Jupiter by the team of Eugene Shoemaker, his wife Carolyn, and David Levy on May 22, 1993. Retrocalculations later showed that the comet had been orbiting Jupiter for quite a few years.

Instead of orbiting around each other, the fragments of Shoemaker-Levy 9 ended up \u201cstrung out like pearls,\u201d as one reporter expressed it,7! in a linear configuration that was al- most as straight as an arrow. What this means is that celestial bodies can be linearly lined up, one \u201cbeneath\u201d the other. If twenty-one individual bodies (the fragments of Shoemaker-Levy 9) can do so, then so, too, can two of them (in our case, Saturn and Earth)\u2019 despite the dif- ference in size and mass. Just as it was Jupiter\u2019s gravitational pull that was responsible for the fragmentation of the comet, so also was it that same force which \u201cstretched\u201d its fragments into their now-famous line-up. It may therefore be objected that Shoemaker-Levy 9\u2019s linear coupling was a fran- sient phenomenon. True\u2014but it can no longer be claimed that a linear coupling of celestial bodies is physically impossible. Shoemaker-Levy 9 taught us that.

As he stated in 1977: \u201cA number of sources suggest that the solitary god wandered for a time, but eventually came to rest at a stationary point, which is celebrated as the cosmic center.\u201d73 Later, and elsewhere, he wrote: \u201cIn the primordial epoch the creator first appeared in the Abyss, alone, wandering without a resting place.\u201d\u201d4 And: \u201cFor a time the creator wan- dered in the luminous sea but eventually came to rest at a point of stability...\u201d75 In this scenario, the axial coupling of the two planets would have taken place at the mo- ment mankind saw their Saturnian deity coming to rest at his stationary celestial point. What, then, would have been Earth\u2019s relation to Saturn during this wandering period? According to Frederick Hall, while Earth might have always been a satellite of Saturn, it originally orbited the giant planet equatorially but, like the Moon in relation to Earth, the ter- restrial globe would have been phase-locked so that one hemisphere would always have faced its Saturnian primary.\u201d This was identical to Lynn Rose\u2019s model and Talbott, who could not fail to note it, despite the fact that he objected to it, found reason to accept it as a temporary condition of the developing Saturnian system. As he announced: \u201cThe simple scheme suggested by Rose may in fact add a vital ingredient to the model-building process. As noted by Fred Hall...there is terrestrial evidence that the Earth was once a satellite of a larger planet, rotating in phase with its revolution. And as I have, in turn, stated to Hall in private communication, there is a great deal of mythical evidence as well. Mythically, the key is the original state of the old sun god, prior to creation. The god, in his earliest remembered state, is \u2018inactive\u2019 or \u2018motion- less,\u2019 not in the axial or polar sense, but apparently in the sense of doing nothing, lacking activity or animation. This is the state which, in the myths, precedes the god\u2019s",

Though Hall himself would be the first to emphasize the tentative character of his speculations, the very fact that they are worth discussing...is at least a partial vindication of Rose\u2019s efforts.\u201d7\u201d While the above is not in keeping with the scenario presented in this work, I do concur with Talbott in that it is worth discussing. More than that, it is worthy of further considera- tion despite its disagreement with the alternative concept presented in this work. At this point one nevertheless wonders why I bother to bring all this up. I do so because Hall\u2019s hypothesis led to yet another attempt in explaining how the co-axial system of Saturn and Earth could have been held together in at least a temporary stability. This has to do with Hall\u2019s elucida- tion of the transition from Earth\u2019s phase-locked equatorial orbit around Saturn to its later ax- ial alignment. As Hall explained: \u201cNow assume this primordial, dying system enters the alien system of the Sun, even- tually encountering the Sun\u2019s largest satellite Jupiter (whose spin axis tilt\u2014or let us say, non tilt\u2014marks it as a primordial companion of the Sun). As a result of this en- counter, or perhaps a series of encounters, Proto-Saturn...is drawn in the direction of the Sun\u2019s equatorial plane which, we shall assume, meant a northerly direction. In ef- fect, Proto-Saturn is pulled from the center of its native planetary system by a mas- sive force \u2018above\u2019 it, while Proto-Saturn, in turn, pulls [its former satellite, Earth] in its wake... \u201cUnder this obviously-precarious state, the usual orbital mechanics have suddenly become irrelevant. What, then, might happen to the Earth?...One of Saturn\u2019s power- ful magnetic poles is now much closer to Earth and the other more remote. Thus, while magnetic forces are much weaker than the force of gravity [actually the oppo- site is true\u20198], we have here a classic case in which they can be invoked.\u201d 79 In short: \u201cEarth is exposed to forces acting as a couple, with the near Saturnian magnetic pole attracting one of Earth\u2019s magnetic poles and repelling the other. As a result, the Earth is flipped over and is locked into a polar alignment with Saturn .\u201d\u00ae\u00b0 Talbott\u2019s proposed temporary wandering of Saturn would then have taken place during the transition period between Earth\u2019s phase-locked equatorial orbit around its primeval pri- mary and Saturn\u2019s eventual settling in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole due to its axial alignment with the giant. As Talbott himself explained: \u201c{After years of research] I concluded that the earliest remembered condition was that of phase lock. That was the best explanation for the initial MOTIONLESSNESS or INACTIVITY of Atum-Ra, prior to...the wandering of the god as he looked for a",

I will not here comment on the validity, or otherwise, of Hall\u2019s particular scenario. I merely note that, regardless of the mechanism proposed by Hall, what he described is pre- cisely what later happened to Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. And so\u2014enter Wallace Thornhill who proposed just such an analogy. To begin with, like Hall and Talbott, Thornhill was also of the belief that Earth originally orbited Saturn equatorially.\u00ae? And, like Hall, he was of the belief that this earlier system was stretched into its co-axial formation only on entering the Sun\u2019s domain of influence. Granted, as already noted, the Shoemaker-Levy 9 event was a transient one. But, according to Thorn- hill, so, too, was the axial-coupled Saturnian system. To quote him: \u201cWe have seen graphically how an assemblage of orbiting bodies can become strung out in a line with the recent dismemberment of Comet Shoemaker-Levy [9] by the in- fluence of Jupiter. That model takes care of the polar Saturn configuration (which I consider to have been short lived but spectacular.)\u201d\u00ae? \u201cThe break-up of the components of [Shoemaker-Levy 9] under the influence of Ju- piter may provide an object lesson for the formation of the Saturnian polar configura- tion, as compellingly reconstructed from ancient sources.\u201d \u00ae4 Unlike Hall, however, Thornhill did not see Jupiter as the cause of the Saturnian Sys- tem\u2019s dismemberment. Instead, he credited our present solar primary \u201cas Saturn\u2019s gravita- tional sphere of influence shrank on approach to the Sun.\u201d As he explained: \u201cThe polar con- figuration seems to have been a spectacular transitory arrangement between the break-up of the original Saturnian stellar system\u201d and its capture \u201cby our current Sun.\u201d85 And: \u201cIt therefore seems that the spectacular Saturnian polar configuration...was created when its planetary system was disrupted by the Sun in a manner similar to that when Jupiter disrupted comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 into a \u2018string of pearls.\u2019 Such an arrange- ment is unstable and, therefore, transitory.\u201d\u00ae\u00b0 \u201cOnce inside the heliosphere, proto-Saturn would have exchanged charge with the solar wind at an ever increasing rate as the charge density increased radially toward the Sun.

As he then stated during an interview: \u201cWhen it comes to estimating the duration of the polar configuration, the best that can be done is to look at the relative velocities of nearby stars. If we take, for the sake of argument, that the relative radial velocity between proto-Saturn and the Sun averaged 10 kilometers per second, it would have taken proto-Saturn about 45 years to cover the 15 billion kilometers to the inner Solar System.\u201d9! He, however, also added that this forty-five year period was \u201cmerely an order-of-magni- tude calculation. As he said: \u201cIt could have taken much longer, but I don\u2019t think it likely to have been much shorter.\u201d 92 Thornhill\u2019s minimum forty-five year period was better than Spedicato and Del Popolo\u2019s maximum of three months for the duration of the Saturnian co-axial system but, when other parameters are taken into account, not by much. To begin with, as Thornhill\u2019s interviewer found reason to comment: \u201cThe one thing that bothers me in all this are those 45 years. Okay\u2014so you say it could have been much longer. Unless I am mistaken, however, I doubt that you would be thinking in hundreds, let alone thousands, of years. And yet, Saturn\u2019s linear for- mation left such an indelible wound on the human psyche\u2014leading to the birth of re- ligion, complete with human sacrifice, the scars of which remain with us till the pre- sent\u2014that it is difficult to believe this was the result of a short transient event. Would 45 years\u2014at best a person\u2019s life-time\u2014or even a hundred, account for the universal mass of mythological material we have at our disposal concerning the event in ques- tion? Would it have been enough to scar humanity for the rest of its existence on Earth?3 To which Thornhill replied:",

Meanwhile, the celestial effects as viewed from Earth would have been so dramatic that it seems to have completely overshadowed even the growing appearance of the Sun as this loomed closer. I\u2019m not able to say how long it would have taken for the Saturnian configuration to have had the lasting influence it has had on the human psyche. I have tried to visualize the apparition in the sky, and I think it would have been psy- chologically overwhelming and disturbing. I imagine that all it would have taken would have been one generation of exposure to that sky for it all to become \u2018im- printed\u2019 on mankind.\u201d94 To say the least, this was not a satisfactory answer. As Jueneman, in agreement with Thornhill\u2019s interviewer, noted, \u201cthe idea of a 45-year-long excursion into the inner Solar System wouldn\u2019t begin to impress mythological engrams on the psyche of the human survi- vors.\u201d95 In reply, Thornhill did hedge a little. \u201cThere are too many unknowns at present,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto pin down the duration of the polar configuration to 50 years, 100 years, or 200 years.\u201d But would even 200 years have been enough for the permanent scarring of the hu- man race? My own main objection to such a short length of time during which the Saturnian system sustained itself in axial alignment, however, has more to do with the paleontological evi- dence than with the time required for such engraphic impressions. As detailed in a previous chapter of this work, this state of affairs stretched back into the remote past, possibly as far as the Cretaceous Period, definitely as far as the Paleocene Epoch of the Tertiary Period. And even if one were to grant a reduction in time of these geological ages, there is no way in which they could be reduced to a mere 200 years. Even Thornhill would balk at that. There is, however, one possible way in which Thornhill\u2019s scenario could be made to ac- commodate the palaeontological data, and so I present the last tentative scenario before driving home. I do so not to play the role of devil\u2019s advocate, but in an endeavor to leave no possible solution unaccounted for. An original Saturnian system with Earth in a phase-locked equatorial orbit around it ala Hall and Thornhill\u2019s hypothesis would satisfy the message of the mytho-historical record as well as the palaeontological data if the present terrestrial north polar region would have faced Saturn. Under this condition, Saturn would still have appeared stationary in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole providing Earth with the required north polar temperature demanded by the southward radiation of fauna and flora from the Arctic region. Earth\u2019s original axis of rota- tion would thus have passed through points in the present equatorial latitude. At this point, one might even ask: Why not adopt this system\u2014which is basically Rose\u2019s model with some modifications\u2014and leave it at that? Would this not be more believable than having Saturn and Earth sharing the same axis of rotation? The problem with this is that, in a change from a phase-locked system in equatorial orbit to a later co-axial formation, Earth would have had to undergo a series of drastic changes. Its gravitational lock would have had to be broken only to be re-installed in an entirely different mode; its orbital speed would have had to come to a halt; its axis of rotation would have had to shift by 90\u00b0; and its rotational speed would have had to increase. To all this must be added the acquisition of an equatorial bulge due to the increase in Earth\u2019s rotational speed. Each",

Acting in concert, abrupt or otherwise, these changes would have resulted in an even more colossal upheaval the gravity of which would boggle the mind. They even belittle Ashton\u2019s previously mentioned gargan- tuan cataclysms, making it doubtful that life would have survived on Earth. It is not that cata- strophic signs are absent from Earth\u2019s geological strata somewhere near the Age of Saturn but, regardless of their extension, these nowhere show signs of the dimensions demanded by the totality of the above mentioned terrestrial changes. And then, when all is said and done, why bother with this proposed change from one type of system to another when, as seen from Earth, nothing would have appeared to change in the celestial sphere? After all, as seen from Earth, Saturn would have ended up motionless in the north celestial sphere just as it would have been prior to the change from the earlier system to the later one. Besides, what is there in the mytho-historical record that can be interpreted in favor of such a change? As we have seen, Talbott is of the opinion that \u201cthe earliest remembered con- dition was that of phase lock.\u201d What led him to this? As we have also indicated, still according to Talbott, a phase-locked Saturnian system is \u201cthe best explanation for the initial MOTIONLESSNESS or INACTIVITY of Atum-Ra\u201d and that this initial inactivity \u201cseems to suggest the motionlessness you would get from a phase lock of a satellite to its primary.\u201d But, unless I have badly missed something, there is nothing in the mytho-historical record that differentiates between an earlier type of Saturnian inactiv- ity or \u201cmotionlessness\u201d and a later but different sort of \u201cmotionlessness\u201d or inactivity. All that the record proclaims is that Saturn and/or its anthropomorphic deity was motionless and/or inactive in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole. No change is indicated. In his own objections to Talbott\u2019s postulate concerning the placement of Jupiter behind Saturn, Thornhill had declared that: \u201cThe principle of parsimony of hypotheses suggests that we don\u2019t introduce another massive body into the system if there are no reports of it during the transition of the proto-Saturn system from a primordial configuration into a polar con- figuration.\u201d\u00ae\u201d Would it not, then, be just as parsimonious in not introducing a different Sat- urnian system since no indications of it can be inferred from the human record? Would not this be in harmony with the scientific principle of Occam\u2019s razor which specifies that entities and events must not be needlessly multiplied? What, then, of Talbott\u2019s insistence concerning the previous wandering of Saturn prior to its eventual stationary establishment in Earth\u2019s north celestial sphere? As Talbott himself well knows, this constituted a postulate which I had for long contested. In the end, however, due to continuing research, I finally ended up accepting it. Not only had I been looking in the wrong place, due to some sort of blind spot I had even misconstrued some of the clearest messages. As it turned out, and as it had been apparent to Talbott from the start, the message of the human record, in this case, turns out to be unequivocal. What, then, to make of this event? Actually, Thornhill had already supplied the answer himself\u2014but he disregarded it. As already noted, when faced with the postulate of Saturn\u2019s early wandering, he presented two possible scenarios to account for it. \u201cThis could mean either that the pre-existing polar con- figuration was disturbed,\u201d he wrote, \u201cor that Saturn\u2019s [satellite was] dislodged from [its] phase locked Saturnian equatorial [orbit] by the increasing influence of the Sun...and moved into the polar configuration.\u201d While he opted for the second proposition as being the \u201cmore",

It was a \u201cpre-existing polar configu- ration\u201d that was disturbed \u201cby the increasing influence of the Sun.\u201d What seems to have transpired is that Earth\u2019s axis was temporarily and slightly dislodged as the Sun attempted to separate it from Saturn. The Saturnian system\u2019s entry into the Sun\u2019s domain, however, was a prolonged development that unfolded in a series of awe-inspiring events. For a while of relative short duration, Earth teetered slightly off balance, and it was during this precarious episode that Saturn was seen to slowly circle around its former station- ary spot. The god wandered for a time. But Saturn was soon to reassert its hold upon its sat- ellite and the deity returned to his former motionless locale. There is, of course, much that went on before this temporary interlude, and even more that followed it\u2014but the detailed ac- count of all that, complete with the relative evidence, will have to wait for the proposed se- quel to this work. Through all this we have not been able to lay down our dragon\u2019s ugly head\u2014because, if the mechanics behind the break-up of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 are not the ones we seek in explaining the manner in which the Saturnian system could have maintained its axial cou- pling, we are simply back to where we had started at the beginning of this chapter. What Shoemaker-Levy 9 taught us is that linear formations can exist, but only for a short period. That is not what we seek. What is required is a means to keep such a formation linearly aligned for a much longer period\u2014longer than 3 months, longer than 45 years, 100 years, or 200 years. We need to discover a means to keep Saturn and Earth axially coupled for thousands of years, if not even longer. What, then, is the answer? COSMIC JETS The subject of the Saturnian co-axial system was discussed during the private round-table session held for the speakers at the 2000 KRONIA Communications world conference in Portland, Oregon. At that time, the astrophysicist Halton Arp declared that linear formations are not uncommon in the cosmos\u2014to which he added the caveat that such formations are only possible if given a long time to form. While this declaration should have raised eye brows, it raised but little. When, a month later, I asked Arp what linear formations he had in mind,\u201d he referred me to the \u201ccondensations\u201d which had been discovered being ejected by galaxies.!\u00a9 These condensations, as Arp called them, are now known to be \u201cviolent jets of plasma that erupt from the cores of some galaxies\u201d !\u00b0! in poleward directions. In other words, the jets in ques- tion are shot out along the axis of the galaxy\u2019s rotation. How are these jets formed? Once deemed anathema to astronomy, electric currents are now known to exist through- out the Solar System. As James Peebles declared: \u201cNo one today denies the importance of magnetic fields and currents in the solar sys- tem and in its formation. This is now completely accepted.\u201d 102 More than that, as noted earlier in this work, 99% of the universe is now known to consist of plasma, an ionized gas that can conduct electricity. This led the plasma physicist and Nobel laureate Hannes Alfv\u00e9n to ask: \u201cwhy shouldn\u2019t plasma still behave the same way for",

As Eric Lerner explains: \u201cIn Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s theory, a galaxy spinning in the magnetic field of space acts as a huge generator, inducing electric currents in the interstellar plasma. The currents flow in great filamentary spirals toward the center of the galaxy, where they turn and flow upwards along the spin axis.\u201d!05 It is this model, according to Alfv\u00e9n, which accounts for the violent jets that are observed erupting from the centre of galaxies. \u201cEvery now and then [says Alfv\u00e9n], the electric current in a galaxy short-circuits and dumps a vast amount of energy into the core. The galaxy \u2018blows a fuse,\u2019 and the blast propels a jet of plasma up the spin axis.\u201d 10 Most astrophysicists, on the other hand, claim that these jets are due to the intense gravity of a black hole harboring at the centre of these galaxies,!\u00b0\u2019 even though the existence of black holes themselves has recently been raising some serious doubts. !\u00b08 But when it comes to similar jets expelled by a breed of new stars, to say nothing of the remains of supernovae, the black hole explanation becomes untenable. The Crab Nebula is the remains of just such a star which went supernova in 1054 A.D. The explosion blazed so brightly that it was visible from Earth in broad daylight. Plasma jets similar to the ones seen ejecting from galaxies, to say nothing of a ring of hot plasma, have recently been revealed by X-ray photography around the \u201cinner workings\u201d of the Crab. The plasma ring itself has been calculated to be 200 times wider than the Solar System. This ring is believed to be \u201cpowered by particles shooting along the star\u2019s magnetic poles\u201d which cre- ate the twin jets that are seen \u201cfiring out perpendicularly to the ring.\u201d !\u00a9 An identical situa- tion has been found in the Vela supernova remnant. !!0 The same is true of young stars, which are now believed to form from gas and dust which \u201cclump\u201d at the centre of \u201can envelope of material\u201d surrounded by \u201ca swirling disk.\u201d Magnetic forces then \u201cdirect jets along the axis.\u201d Actually, even our own Sun is now posited to have exhibited such bi-polar outflows,!!! to say nothing of a so-called accretion disk, a remnant of which remains to this day as a circum- solar ring of asteroidal dust.!!2 But what have these cosmic jets to do with Earth\u2019s axial coupling with proto-Saturn?",

At least visually, the item in ques- tion bore such an uncanny similarity to my proposed model of the proto-Saturnian brown dwarf star that I believed it impor- tant enough to share with the other at- tendees. Unfortunately, all those present who were interested in the co-axial Sat- urnian system brushed it aside as irrele- vant. Worse still, Arp himself declared the item a mistaken interpretation. It was only during my following corre- spondence with Arp that I realized he had mistaken my new star for something en- tirely different. What I had passed around for consideration was a picture of the star designated as HD 163296. What Arp mis- took it for was the controversial runaway planet\u2014if that is what it is\u2014that had been discovered streaming away from the double star system known as TMR-1 by Susan Terebey.

(The jet itself is labeled HH 409.) HH 34 has at least five of these globular clusters all lined up in a row along the star\u2019s polar jet. The tell- tale \u201caccretion disk\u201d is also shown encircling HD 163296. Here, then, was incontestable evidence\u2014nay, proof\u2014that axially aligned linear forma- tions were not only possible, but actually existed in space. They line up along plasma jets ejected poleward, sharing the same axis of rotation as their parent star, exactly as has been posited for Earth and Saturn in this study. Nor can it be said that these configurations are in any way transitory, as in the case of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, since they are believed to exist for millions of years\u2014and thus Arp\u2019s caveat re the \u201cvery long time\u201d needed for their formation. Moreover, rather than being uniquely rare cases, Herbig-Haro objects occur in profusion. As of 1994, as many as 250 of such objects had been discovered,!!5 and more keep being added to the list. Now if these stars can line up as much as five bodies in co-axial alignment, what is so impossible about proto-Saturn having had one such body, that is Earth, similarly aligned? Moreover, as those who are already familiar with the Saturn thesis know, and as I intend to show in future sequels, Proto-Saturn eventually ended up having at least three planetary bodies co-axially aligned. Thus, whatever keeps the bodies in Herbig-Haro jets axially aligned would also have kept Saturn and Earth (to say nothing of later planets) in similar alignment. What I must stress here is that all this is not to say that the Saturnian system was a Her- big-Haro object, the immense masses and distances of which alone would preclude such an identity. What is being hypothesized is that the Saturnian system can be visualized to have been a scaled down version of such an \u201cobject,\u201d concerning which more will be revealed in our final chapter. At this crucial point, however, the following question presents itself: Did proto-Saturn display jets?",

        "main_text": "Chapter 21 The Axis Mundi THE RUACH ight at the very beginning of the Book of Genesis it is stated that, when eretz (translated as \u201cearth\u201d) was still in the age of darkness, before the commencement of Creation, \u201cthe spirit of Elohim moved upon the face of the waters.\u201d! As we have seen, the deity named Elohim is to be understood as a personification of the planet Saturn. We have also seen that the waters referred to were celestial in nature and that these can perhaps be best understood as a circumstellar cloud surrounding the proto-planet in question. What, then, could it mean that the spirit of Saturn moved over the face of these waters? The Hebrew word translated as \u201cspirit\u201d is ruach, a word which has the additional mean- ing of \u201cwind.\u201d We find the same situation in Arabic, as also in Maltese, where the words for \u201cspirit,\u201d or \u201csoul,\u201d and \u201cwind\u201d share the same linguistic root: rih for \u201csoul\u201d and/or \u201cspirit,\u201d rih for \u201cwind.\u201d And, in fact, the Hebrew Talmud does not \u201cconceive\u201d of ruach as God\u2019s spirit, but as God\u2019s wind.2 True, Louis Ginzberg warns that this was \u201ccertainly\u201d due \u201cto an anti-Christian tendency, since the Christians identified God\u2019s spirit with the Holy Ghost\u201d with which the Jews do not comply. Perhaps. There is no denying, however, that ruach is the usual word used for \u201cwind\u201d in the entire Old Testament, including Genesis. It therefore seems more probable that the reason ruach was translated as \u201cspirit\u201d in the second verse of this particular Book stems from the fact that the \u201cspirit\u201d of Elohim (usually translated as \u201cGod\u201d) seemed to make better sense than \u201cwind\u201d to those who had lost the original meaning behind the verse. James Strong additionally tells us that ruach can also be interpreted as \u201cwhirlwind,\u201d4 a datum we shall not lose track of. We find the same idea expressed in the Gnostic words of the Sethians according to Hippolytus: \u201cNow from the water there has come, as a first derivative principle, a fierce and violent wind which is the cause of all generation.\u201d5 Out of Indic lore comes an echo of the same phenomenon. As related in the Hymn of Na- rayana, this being, elsewhere considered \u201cThe Primal Lord,\u201d had \u201csat above\u201d in \u201ceternal solitary shade,\u201d in \u201cimpenetrable gloom,\u201d before \u201cthings unexisting to existence sprung.\u201d We thus recognize Narayana as a manifestation of the primeval Saturnian god. It is then said that a \u201cprimordial wind\u201d breathed gently over the \u201cvast expanse.\u201d\u00a9 Similarly, a Buddhist myth relates how the surface of the cosmic waters was \u201cstirred by the dawn wind of creation.\u201d\u201d",

Even out amid the vast Pacific we find that the whirlwind was one of the first items cre- ated by the Tahitian \u201cSky-producer,\u201d Ra\u2019i-tupua.? We thus notice that, with the exception of the Tahitian tradition, this wind and/or whirl- wind was not said to have been created, but was believed to have always been there. But what was this whirlwind, this spirit, or soul, that seems to be so intimately connected with traditions of Creation? SANCHONIATHON\u2019S COSMOGONY We turn next to Phoenician, that is Canaanite, mythology. According to Sanchoniathon: \u201cThe beginning of all things was a dark and condensed windy air, or a breeze of thick air, and a chaos, turbid and black as Erebus; and these were unbounded, and for a long series of ages destitute of form.\u201d!\u00b0 Thus, as in the mythology of other races, the wind and chaos, the latter of which we have already identified as Saturn\u2019s circumstellar cloud, had always existed. Sanchoniathon, a Phoenician priest, lived sometime in the 6th or 7th century B. C. He is said to have copied the sacred inscriptions from the pillars in the temple of Melkart, some say of Ba\u2019al Hamon, at Tyre, when these crashed to the ground in an earthquake. His work has not survived in its entirety, but Philo of Byblos, a scholar who was himself a Phoenician, pre- served various excerpts of Sanchoniathon\u2019s work in his own Phoinikika sometime during the last century B.C. As it happened, this work, too, was eventually lost but, once again, frag- ments from it were discovered and preserved by Eusebius Pamhili, a bishop of Caesarea, Pal- estine, in A.D. 314, and incorporated into his own work, Evangelicae Praeparationis. As others before me have stated, and as is obvious from the work itself, in part, San- choniathon\u2019s cosmogony resembles that of the Babylonians while heavily influenced by Greek and Jewish sources,!! if not also those of Egypt.!2 Thus, for instance, when he claims that chaos was as \u201cblack as Erebus,\u201d he literally means \u201cdarkness,\u201d Erebus being the dark Greek Limbo said to have been situated between Earth and Hades. It might not have been fair for George Cook to state that Sanchoniathon\u2019s cosmogony cannot be taken seriously \u201cas an account of genuine Phoenician beliefs.\u201d3 As he himself stated: \u201cAt the same time Philo [and, therefore, Sanchoniathon] did not invent all the non- sense which he has handed down; he drew upon various sources, Greek and Egyptian, some of them ultimately of Babylonian origin, and incidentally, he mentions matters of interest which, when tested by other evidence, are fairly well supported. He shows at any rate that some sort of a theology existed in his day...\u201d 4",

        "main_text": "What seems to have transpired is that, very much like the Greek Hesiod, who had lived a century before him, to say nothing of other ancient writers, Sanchoniathon collated material from different sources which he then compiled into a single running narrative through the literary device of genealogical descent. Not wishing to leave any of his data unaccounted for, he seems to have gathered disparate myths which recounted the same events and presented them as different occurrences in a chronological succession. As Sanchoniathon continues: \u201cBut when this wind became enamored of its own first principles (the chaos), an in- timate union took place, that connection was called Pothos; and it was the beginning of the creation of all things. And it (the chaos) knew not its own production; but from its embrace with the wind was generated Mot, which some call Ilus, but others, the putrefaction of a watery mixture.\u201d !5 As I have attempted to show in a previous chapter, this mot was considered by some as slime and, by others, as a rotting of aquatic composition.'\u00a9 As there noted, modern scholars have supported the interpretation of this word as \u201cwater.\u201d !7 But since this celestial water was obviously the same, or of the same nature, as the chaos which surrounded proto-Saturn as a circumstellar cloud, it also becomes obvious that this is one of those occasions in which San- choniathon fused two variant readings of the same event into a sequential one. (There are others, but these do not concern us here.) As shown above, Sanchoniathon also claimed that some called Mot by the name Ilus. To us, this has interest since, elsewhere, he himself informs us that Ilus was merely the Phoeni- cian form of the Greek Cronus!\u00ae (or Kronos), the same as El. Knowing full well by now whom Kronos and El represented, we again come face to face with the association of these early events with the planet Saturn. BOREAS We again find this wind associated with a Saturnian deity, in this case Atum, in Egyptian mythology. More than that, this wind is there described as having been a north wind, said to have come from Atum.!9 So, likewise, with Ra (or Re), who is beseeched to \u201cinhale the north wind.\u201d20 In the Pyramid Texts, this north wind is said to \u201clift up\u201d the deceased king in his assimilation to the god.?! A \u201clifting up,\u201d in turn, connotes a support, another datum we shall not lose track of. We meet this same north wind in the mythology of ancient Greece where the entity in question was anthropomorphosed as Aquilo, more popularly known as Boreas. Although Greek mythology encompasses four anthropomorphosed wind entities\u2014Boreas, Zephyros, Notus, and Eurus\u2014it is Boreas that holds the centre stage. It is, in fact, from this Greek name, through Latin borealis, that the English adjective \u201cboreal\u201d is derived.",

Originally, however, Boreas seems to have been envisaged as a being with serpent tails for feet.2* It is interesting to note that, in the late third century A.D., Lactantius used Boreas as an analogy of the Sanctus Spiritus which impregnated the virgin mother of Jesus.* As in the case of the Hebrew ruach, this obviously stems from the much more ancient identity of the wind as the spirit of Elohim (to say nothing of the entity\u2019s fructifying power, which will be explored in a future volume). In fact, as Donald Mackenzie indicated: \u201c\u2018Wind\u2019 and \u2018breath\u2019 and \u2018spirit\u2019 were believed by many primitive peoples to be identical.\u201d But, in the main, we note this fact: As a wind associated with Saturn, it is not surprising to find this entity linked to the north since that is where ancient tradition places both the Sat- urnian planet and its allied deities. We would, on the contrary, have been surprised had this not been reported to have been so. Thus even in much later times, the Hindus were still associating the wind with Dhruva,?5 that is the North Star which, as we noted in an earlier chapter, had originally been one of the Sanskrit names for the planet Saturn.",

As in the case of Boreas and his Egyptian counterpart, this would again testify that the source of Ehecatl lay in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole. At Chichen Itza, in Mexico, there is a circular pre-Columbian building which the Ameri- can explorer John Lloyd Stephens named El Caracol\u2014\u2018\u201cThe Snail.\u201d This edifice contains an interior spiral staircase which leads to a round observatory oriented to the four cardinal points of the compass. As Neil Baldwin explains: \u201cThe Snail building is an important signpost on our Plumed Serpent trail for several reasons. The round shape of the building links it to the chain of structures throughout Mesoamerica consecrated to Ehecatl, the Wind God, one of Plumed Serpent\u2019s per- sonalities.\u201d3! El Caracol was aptly named since its interior winding staircase is reminiscent of the coiling shell of the snail. We find this same spiral coiling in the outer ramparts of the strangely shaped structure at Calixtlahuaca, which was also dedicated to Ehecatl. Among the Maya, this god was known as Kukulkan, one aspect of whom was also that of wind god.*? It is thus fitting that, in a curious Maya vase, Kukulkan is symbolically shown emerging from a snail.33 It was, however, the conch shell, rather than the snail, which was intimately associated with Ehecatl. As Tom Lowenstein has it: \u201c...in his guise as Ehecatl, the Plumed Serpent [that is, Quetzalcoatl] wore a conch shell, his symbolic \u2018jewel of the wind.\u2019 In imitation of their deity himself, priests of",

        "main_text": "the Quetzalcoatl cult wore conch shells cut in cross section showing a concentric, whorled pattern that represented the movement of the wind. Many of the temples dedicated to Quetzalcoatl were also circular, signifying the eddying of the wind.\u201d34 The spiral on the shell of a snail, as well as the interior construction of the conch, both symbolic of Ehecatl as the god of wind,35 are more significant of a whirlwind than an ordi- nary breeze. This is so much so that, among the punishments which Quetzalcoatl was be- lieved to inflict on the human race were tornadoes and water spouts.3\u00a2 Tornadoes and water spouts exhibit a verticality stretching between heaven and Earth, much in the manner exem- plified by the various wind entities we have been examining. Thus, for instance, in the Vi- enna Codex, Quetzalcoatl-Ehecatl is depicted with arms raised to support the sky.37 SHU The above cannot but remind us of the Egyptian god Shu, who was said to have flowed from Ra,38 but by others as having been self-created.39 He was, in effect, the very breath of Ra. Like Ehecatl, Shu was described, and profusely depicted, as holding up the \u201csky.\u201d4! Additionally, like Boreas, he was also considered to have been the personification of the north wind.* Rather than separating the celestial waters from the terrestrial ones, as in the case of Ehecatl and Elohim, Shu was said to have separated heaven from Earth.43 The very name Shu has been interpreted as \u201cthe uplifter.\u201d4 As the uplifter of heaven, he becomes its support. As Budge informs us, Shu was also considered \u201ca god of light, or light personified.\u201d45 But light in this instance was also \u201cdeclared to be the prop of the sky.\u201d46 Actually, the character of Shu is much more complex than that and, to be sure, he has been presented here somewhat out of chronological order. We will have much more to say concerning this being in following volumes. I have merely included him here as a link in the chain of evidence concerning the nature of the primeval north wind in order to show the near- universality of this motif. The most popular heaven-sustaining strong-man in the western world, needless to say, is the well-known Greek Atlas. But, because I do not wish to step outside, or beyond, the chronological sequence I have been attempting to follow, his treatment, too, must be post- poned to a future work. In the meantime, what all the above seems to imply is that this primordial wind was visi- ble as an illuminated support of the sky within which the Saturnian orb resided. The only type of whirlwind that could be seen to support the sky would have to have been in the form of a tornado or water spout, already encountered as one of the punishments inflicted by Quet- zalcoatl.",

A fixed vortex of planetary proportions stretched between the immobile proto-Saturnian orb and Earth\u2019s northern regions boggles the imagination. And yet, as we shall continue to discover, this seems to be precisely what our ancient forefathers were attempting to describe. HURAKAN In Guatemala we meet with the divinity named Hurakan, a deity who was also known in the West Indies. Additionally called Heart of Heaven, he shares this epithet with the Egyptian Atum/Saturn who was also referred to as the Firm Heart of the Sky.47 The Chinese Tao, whom we earlier identified as the Saturnian circumstellar or placental cloud, was likewise alluded to as the heart of heaven.*8 It is therefore noteworthy to find Hurakan pictured in Late Classic times in the middle of stylized swirls of smoke or clouds, which are here inter- preted as proto-Satum\u2019s placental cloud. Thus, like the Saturnian deity of other nations, Hurakan is described as having hovered over the cosmic waters.\u2019 Venerated as the Lord of Creation, bringing forth the first dawn, he, too, is said to have presided over the whirl- wind.>!

        "main_text": "David Leeming presented Hurakan as an aspect of the Feathered Serpent, % that is our old friend Quetzalcoatl. In the Popul Vuh, however, Hurakan and Feathered Serpent, there called Gucumatz, are presented as partners in Creation. Thus, while we view Gucu- matz/Quetzalcoatl as the embodiment of the Saturnian deity, it is obvious that Hurakan, while closely associated with proto-Saturn, was visualized as a separate entity. In a recent work, M. Preuss had half a mind to identify Hurakan, which name she ren- dered by the Spanish spelling \u201cJurakan,\u201d with the constellation of Ursa Minor. This is in- teresting because Ursa Minor, the Little Bear, is the very northern constellation which con- tains the Pole Star, thus situating Hurakan in the very locality where the myths of other na- tions place the primeval north wind. Additionally, however, Preuss was astute enough to note the connection between this deity and the axis mundi,55 the term used by mythologists to de- note the boreal column said to have stretched between Earth and sky. Of additional importance is the fact that the name Hurakan translates as \u201cOne Leg\u201d*\u00b0\u2014which brings us to the next motif in our unfolding scenario. THE ONE-LEGGED GOD Among the ancient Egyptians, Osiris was said to have shone \u201cabove the Leg of heaven.\u201d What this indicates is that this \u201cLeg\u201d appeared beneath the Saturnian orb, represented here as Osiris.57 We also note that, whatever this leg was, it had the appearance of fire. \u201cHail, Leg of fire,\u201d was the manner in which it was invoked.*8 That this \u201cLeg of fire\u201d descended from Earth\u2019s celestial north pole, the proto-Saturnian place par excellence, was cogently argued by Gerald Massey\u00ae and, as Talbott has shown, also by Hermann Kees.\u00ae It thus becomes appar- ent that this \u201cLeg\u201d stood for a support which stretched from beneath Saturn\u2019s south pole to Earth\u2019s north polar regions. In India we meet with the deity named Manu whose assimilation to the god Saturn had already been noticed in the 19th century by William Jones and G. S. Faber.\u00b0! That this identi- fication is correct is borne out by Manu\u2019s epithet of Satyavrata, which is one of the many Sanskrit names for the planet Saturn.\u00ae Moreover, as Jacob Grimm indicated, Satyavrata is the Sanskrit equivalent of the Slavic Sitivrat, which is also a name for Saturn.\u00ae It is therefore noteworthy that Manu was said to have performed a severe penance which consisted of being \u201cpoised on one leg\u201d for ten thousand years. It is also stated in the Upanishads, that Brahma, whom we have already seen identified as Saturn, \u201cis only one-footed.\u201d65",

The added interest here is that, very much like Manu, Dhruva was said to have maintained himself in intense meditation while standing upright on one foot. Furthermore, in Sanskrit, the word dhruva also means \u201cpost\u201d and/or \u201cstake\u201d\u00ae? which, as Roger Ashton indicated, evi- dently stood for \u201ca celestial support.\u201d In the Maitri Upanishad, Vishnu himself is referred to as \u201cAll-supporting.\u201d\u00a9\u00b0 Another epithet of Vishnu is Yamakila, derived from Yama, one of the Sanskrit names for Saturn, plus the suffix kilah, meaning \u201cpost\u201d and or \u201cpillar.\u201d7\u00b0 Yet another epithet of Vishnu was Ekapada, from Ekapad, which means one-footed.7!

Other epithets of Saturn in Sanskrit literature are Pangu, signifying a lame person,\u201d4 and Shirnapada, meaning \u201cwithered foot.\u201d75 Perhaps the most well-known Sanskrit name for the planet Saturn is Shani (or Sani).76 And while Shani is not described as having been one legged, he is nonetheless said to have been lame.7\u201d As Talbott has noted: \u201cThe Celtic Sol [so named by the Romans] stood on one foot all day. The African Wachoga tell of the old god Mrule who...had only one leg...Russian myth presents the demonic Verlioka as a...one-legged figure. So also was the Chinese primeval god K\u2019uei one-footed.\u201d78 One even finds this one-legged god among the Australian Aborigines, where he is re- membered as Turunbulun.7? One word of caution: There are other deities said to have possessed a single leg or foot who do not translate as personifications of the planet Saturn, prime among whom is the Mesoamerican Tezcatlipoca. But that, too, is a related topic that must await a future volume. THE PHALLIC POST In the year 2000, while exploring the Neolithic remains at the Nakovana cave near Du- brovnik on Croatia\u2019s Dalmatian Coast, Tim Kaiser and Staso Forenbaher made a revealing discovery. Having come across a barrier to the cave, first thought to be a natural rock fall, but later disclosed as having been man made, they penetrated beyond it to three natural cham- bers. Various shards of pottery, some dating to 6000 B. C., were found scattered all over the floors of these chambers. The central room, however, contained a two-foot high stalagmite, \u201cunmistakably phallic in shape.\u201d Examination of this stalagmite showed that it had actually been formed in another part of the cave from where it was detached and moved to the central cubicle. Near the stalagmite was a trough covered with limestone slabs, which is thought to have served as a bench, running the entire width of the cave. A three-foot deep pit was also found nearby.\u00ae\u00b0 All of this marks the cave as having been a cult center devoted to the wor- ship of the phallus. Natural formations of similar resemblance have long attracted the attention of primitive societies as well as members of civilized races. One such phallic rock, an artificially en- hanced natural formation, and now a prominent stop for tourists, is Kauleonanahoa, in the forest above the Kalaupapa Cliffs, on the Hawaiian island of Molokai. It has, of course, long been known that phallic worship was an institution that stretches back into the mist of time. In certain parts of the world, especially in India, it continues to",

        "main_text": "Those of Western religious sentiment would be even more shocked to learn that the Hebrew El, the very same god who, under the name Elohim, is believed to have created the world, was said to have been equipped with a long penis. What was this sacred virile member attached to god? Among the Egyptians, the phallus of Ra was highly honored. This is indicated in the praises glorifying the god. As it was written: \u201cWho is this?\u201d And the answer is given: \u201cIt is Osiris.\u201d But, as an alternative, which, in this case, as in many others, boils down to the same thing, the passage continues with: \u201cOthers, however, say that his name is Ra, and that the god who dwelleth in Amentet is the phallus of Ra, wherewith he had union with himself.\u201d85 The most popular ithyphallic god of Egypt was Min. Unfortunately, despite Ev Coch- rane\u2019s attempt to identify this deity as a personification of Saturn\u00ae and, later, through a change of mind, as a personification of Mars, 87 not enough is known about this deity to reach a definite conclusion concerning his genesis. Although at this point, as noted above, the inclusion of Shu would be out of chronologi- cal sequence, it is interesting to note that this god was inter alia lauded as \u201cLord of the Phal- lus.\u201d88 In the Pyramid Texts, he is actually equated with the male organ of Atum.8\u00b0 What is even more revealing, however, is the fact that, in some depictions, the heaven-sustaining Shu is replaced with the phallus of Geb. It is then evident that the phallus of the deity was itself believed to have acted as the support of heaven much in the same manner that the single leg of the god did. As Diodorus reported, it was not only the Egyptians who consecrated \u201cthat member\u201d in their initiatory rites, but quite a few other nations.\u201d And, as a more modern authority noted: \u201cThe antiquity of the phallus as an amulet is shown by the number found among Egyptian sculptures. No visitor to Egyptian antiquities needs to be told this...The phallus was the most sacred amulet worn by the vestal virgins of ancient Rome. Moreover, we find that Sesostris of the early twelfth dynasty, who conquered Asia, set up memorials of a phallic nature among the people who had acted bravely...In the ruins of Zimbabwe, in Central Africa, are to be seen phalli carved upon stone, similar to those found in Sardinia, which are said to be Phoenician...Again, numbers of phallic amulets in bronze are found in the earliest Etruscan tombs...\u201d\u00b0! Mythologists have always assumed that phallic worship arose out of the ancients\u2019 recog- nition of the male member as a generative organ, and thus worthy of sacred honor as a sym- bol of fertility. Nor is this entirely a modern view, as evidenced by the writings of Dio- dorus.%2 That this is a logical assumption there is no need to tell. As an example, the lower part of a statue of Dionysos, at Phigaleia, was covered with leaves of bay and ivy. Arthur Cook surmised that this was \u201cpossibly\u201d done in order to conceal the god\u2019s erect phallus and",

A problem, on the other hand, does present itself when in-depth research re- veals that the divine phallus was believed to have acted as a supporting post for heaven or the sky. One thing concerning which Cook was correct is that the cult of Dionysos was a phallic one.

But what is of greater importance to this study is that the same Dionysos, still decked with ivy-sprays, was elsewhere represented by a post dressed up as the god.% That Dionysos represented an aspect of the Saturnian deity need not be repeated. The nature of what this divine phallus really was comes to us from Phlius. There, a winged aged man with phallus erect was once depicted on the gates of the city. This being was known as phaos rhyentes. What is interesting, however, is that, according to Hippolytus, Pphaos rhyentes was said by the Sethians to mean \u201cthe downward flow of light from above.\u201d \u201cFor there was a ray coming from above from that perfect light held fast in the dark, dread- ful, bitter, filthy water...\u00b08 The \u201cperfect light\u201d from which this ray of light emerged was a dim remembrance of the Saturnian sun \u201cheld fast\u201d in the centre of its placental cloud, re- membered here as \u201cdark, dreadful, bitter, filthy water\u201d\u2014the \u201cmud,\u201d or \u201cslime,\u201d or mot of the Phoenicians. That this was a reminiscence of the ruach of Genesis is then indicated when Hippolytus continues by stating that this was \u201cthe spirit of light \u2018rushing\u2019 over the water.\u201d And since this ray was remembered as \u201ccoming from above,\u201d it stands to reason that the water in question was also somewhere above, presumably in the sky, as our thesis actually demands. It was then this \u201cdownward flow of light\u201d from proto-Saturn and its placental cloud which the ancients likened to the god\u2019s single leg and/or his penis. In some instances, the god himself was considered to have been nothing more than the phallus of Creation. Conse- quently, one of the meanings of the name of the Hindu Creator, Prajapati, is the male organ of generation. !\u00a9 More revealing is a passage in the Linga Purana which has been interpreted to mean that: \u201cPradhana, the primary unevolved matter, the cause of the universe is Linga itself. At the root of Linga the creator Brahma is stationed.\u201d !0! Here not only do we again find a reference to our posited placental cloud as the \u201cun- evolved matter,\u201d but its direct association with the linga, that is phallus, as also with Brahma who, as we have seen, originated as an avatar of Saturn. Curiously, in the Bhagavata Purana, there is presented the image of a cosmic porpoise with the planet Saturn itself projected on its generative organ.102 Of most importance is the fact that, in some cases, a phallus \u201csculptured in granite, marble, or ivory,\u201d which used to be kept \u201cin the inmost recess, or sanctuary\u201d of Hindu temples, was \u201csurmounted by a golden star.\u201d 13 A similar colossal phallus was presented by Ptolemy Philadelphus to the temple of Osiris in Alexandria. This, too, was crowned in gold",

We may therefore safely assume that the pre-Islamic Samsu originally stood for the same planet. This is lent evidence by the fact that our present Sun does not appear to be rest- ing on any kind of pillar while, as we have seen above, the proto-Saturnian sun was so con- ceived to have stood on a support which was inter alia visualized as a vertical whirlwind, a single leg, and/or an erect phallus. Thus, Elmer Suhr, who confused so many mythological issues, was nevertheless astute enough to realize that the primeval wind \u201cis especially effec- tive in the heavens at the top of the cosmic column.\u201d!0 Suhr tells us that this cosmic column was \u201ca very old concept dating back to primitive times,\u201d and that it was the \u201csun\u201d on top of this column that created the wind \u201cby its whirling motion.\u201d!07 Also: \u201cIt is especially important to think of the cosmic column not as a static post but as a constantly whirling crucible, forever forming and re-forming the constituent ele- ments into the changing aspects of human experience.\u201d !\u00b08 The memory concerning the association of this pillar with Saturn was retained in the Christian Sybyllines which proclaim that Sabaoth Adonai \u201cshall sit on a heavenly throne and establish a great pillar,\u201d!\u00b0? which is elsewhere rendered a \u201cpillar of glory.\u201d!!\u00b0 Sabaoth, sometimes rendered Zebaot, is a name derived from the Hebrew tsaba or tseba\u2019ah, meaning \u201carmy,\u201d and is used in the New Testament as the military epithet of God.!!! Adonai, mean- while, means \u201cmy Adon,\u201d where Adon is a Phoenician title that simply means \u201cLord.\u201d !!2 Taking their cue from the Canaanites, who were the same as the Phoenicians, the Jews used the epithet Adonai to designate their own God. Thus it was said that when God asked Adam what his name was, Adam replied with the words: \u201cAdonai, Lord, because Thou art Lord over all creatures.\u201d !!3 As Louis Ginzberg has it, the name Adonai is \u201cthe very name God had given unto Himself, the name by which the angels call Him, the name that will remain im- mutable evermore.\u201d!!4 Moreover, when Moses is said to have asked God for his name, God is reported to have replied: \u201cThou desirest to know My Name? My Name is according to My acts. When I judge My creatures, I am called Elohim...when I rise up to do battle against the sinners, I am Lord Zebaot...when I have mercy upon the world, I am Adonai.\u201d !!5 Elsewhere it is said that Adonai and Elohim were \u201cthe two sacred names of God,\u201d !!\u00a2 even though, in fact, he was known by various others. This, then, tells us that, as far as the Jews were concerned, Adonai and Lord Zebaot, which translates as Sabaoth Adonai, was the same as Elohim, the majestic plural of El, that is Saturn.",

It had no place of attach- ment for its root. In the midst of this a thing was generated which resembled a reed- shoot. ..\u201d128 In the Yuki myth of Creation, the sky pillar is represented as a rope.

But Taik\u00e9-mol \u201cwalked\u201d over the water \u201cas if it were land.\u201d It was then that he \u201cmade a rope and laid it from north to south,\u201d129 Not surprisingly, among the Kwakiutl of America\u2019s Northwest Coast, the cosmic pillar was envisioned, and represented, as atotem pole, the name of which was Kalakuyuwish,",

When written with different deter- minatives, however, aakhu and/or aakhut or khut also means \u201clight,\u201d \u201cradiance,\u201d \u201cbrilliance,\u201d and \u201cfire.\u201d !32 It also stands in for the Light-god or Great Light. 33 But, as Talbott has ably indicated, the most common symbol used to denote khu and/or khut reveals \u201cvertical streams of light ascending the world axis.\u201d 54 But, while seemingly ascending, it was also remem- bered as a radiant column having been \u201cpoured out\u201d by the creator Atum. !35 As we have seen, an epithet of the Hindu Vishnu is Dhruvakshara, derived from Dhruva, the Pole Star, and akshara, which has the meanings of \u201cimperishable,\u201d \u201cindestructible,\u201d and \u201cundecaying.\u201d 36 The word akshara itself is, as Ashton had in- dicated, '37 arguably formed from akshah, meaning \u201cpivot\u201d or \u201caxis,\u201d 138 and -rah, meaning \u201cfire.\u201d!39 Akshara can therefore be translated as \u201cfiery axis.\u201d There is no fiery axis emanating from the Pole Star but, re- membering that Dhruva was also an epithet of Vishnu, whom we have already equated with the Saturnian deity, it becomes obvious that this fiery axis, remembered by others as a ray of light ascending or descending from above, must have been seen ascending or descending from that same Saturnian deity. COOK\u2019S SUPPORT With few exceptions, mythologists have never known what to do with the entity they themselves have dubbed the axis mundi, the polar column, or sky pillar. Arthur Cook, who had so much to say about the subject, opted for Jupiter,'40 which he understood as a personification of the sky,'+! in lieu of the Saturnian deity, as having occupied the pillar\u2019s apex. Despite all that, he could find no physical explanation to account for the phenomenon.",

The classical authors bear witness to the terror which this thought in- spired among the peoples of Central Europe.\u201d !#+ Cook has a lot to say about this fear, even though he confessed ignorance concerning its origin. This did not, however, stop him from offering an educated guess. \u201cHow that belief arose, we can only surmise. It may be that in the dim past, when the ancestors of these tribes developed out of hunters into herdsmen and emerged from the forest on to the open plain, they missed the big tree that seemed to support the sky...And in the absence of that mighty prop there was nothing to guarantee the safety of their roof.\u201d !45 Cook can well talk about the \u201cbig tree that seemed to support the sky\u201d but, in actual fact, a forest is made up of more than a single tree. Why, then, did primitive man not conceive of a sky prop that was composed of multiple posts? Why a single pillar? And, in any case, why would this arboreal support have been visualized as the god\u2019s single leg, his erect phallus, or, worse still, a ray of light ascending or descending from above? SUHR\u2019S LUNAR SHADOW Other mythologists, needless to say, have not accepted Cook\u2019s explanation even though but few of them have ever proffered an interpretation of their own. Among those few was Elmer Suhr. He, too, speaks constantly of \u201cthe whirling of the column between heaven and earth\u201d 46 but, when it comes to his interpretation of the phenomenon, he stumbles badly. His belief, of course, was that it was the Sun that rested at the summit of the cosmic pillar. !47 He even speaks of \u201cthe sacred disc of the sun\u201d turning itself rapidly as if this was a well- known datum.!* As he tells us: \u201cThe sun, as it rolled or whirled through the sky, had the power to whirl other objects coming within its sphere of influence, and among these objects the column of the cosmos was apparently included.\u201d!4? I hope I will not be accused of splitting hairs when I claim that whirling is not the same as rolling, and that while the Sun may be said to roll across the sky, it does not appear to whirl. And then, what would the Sun, arcing across the sky, have to do with an axis which, by its very definition, had to have been stationary? As he himself tells us, \u201cthe meteorological column could serve, metaphorically, as a support for the sky just as any stone column could support the roof and ceiling of a",

Suhr, of course, has an answer to all this. As he continues to inform us: \u201cMany peoples of the Near East and the Mediterranean area believed that the sun...was the primary source for the quintessence of life. It was the sun\u2019s light, re- flected upon the face of the moon, that brought fertility and life to the soil by way of the whirling lunar shadow...\u201d'>!

Suhr ex- plains: \u201cAt the top, the column must have been in contact with the sun and the moon, the two bodies from which it derived most of its life principle...Of course, the two bodies were not always directly above one another, but the sun in ancient astronomy was al- ways exerting an influence on the moon from above, and both influenced the earth\u2014which made the columnar form symbolically suitable.\u201d!52 And: \u201cWhether we think of the column as a shaft grounded in the earth or as the cone- shaped shadow of the moon, its lower extremity appears to penetrate the earth...\u201d 3 Here, then, is Suhr\u2019s answer to this old enigma. According to him, the notion of the sky pillar was derived from the conical shadow the Moon casts in space, which shadow termi- nates on Earth, during a solar eclipse.!*4 As he pointed out in a different work, \u201csurely a shadow from a body ranging somewhere between the sun and the earth and making an occa- sional direct contact with the earth must have been, for the ancient mind, a projection of di- vine beneficence.\u201d 1955 As we have seen, the real nature of solar eclipses was known to the ancient Greeks. To repeat what we have said on a previous page, both Plutarch and Pliny knew that lunar eclipses were caused by the projection of Earth\u2019s shadow on the lunar surface, and that this projection took the form of a cone, which, as Suhr himself explained, would have been \u201can observation based on what the naked eye could see\u201d plus \u201ca simple deduction from a law of physics.\u201d!5\u00a2 As Suhr correctly deduced: \u201cIf the ancients were aware of the earth\u2019s shadow, they must also have known, as Diodorus testifies, about that of the moon projected toward the earth during a solar eclipse...\u201d157 But, while all of this is true, it can hardly be said that this was also known to our primitive forefathers who would not have been capable of any \u201csimple deduction from a law",

Besides, even had it been, it does not remain stationary. And it does not whirl. Moreover, the immediate body atop its cone is the Moon, concerning which the myth of the axis mundi has nothing to offer. Only a \u201csun\u201d is sometimes mentioned as having been on top of it.

THE POLE OF THE ECLIPTIC In Hamilet\u2019s Mill, de Santillana and von Dechend analyzed some of the most obscure motifs in all of mythology and came up with a cosmic interpretation even though they hamstrung themselves by disallowing any conclusion that threatened to trespass uniformitarian precepts. Although not the subject of the present volume, the mytho-historical record is full of allu- sions to cosmic catastrophes which caused terrestrial cataclysms on a colossal scale. We find there records of unprecedented floods, massive earthquakes, the shifting of entire mountains, in concert with the displacement of celestial bodies and a rain of fire from the sky. What de Santillana and von Dechend proposed in the above mentioned work is that ancient man de- rived these beliefs from the slow displacement of the pole star through the precession of the equinoxes over the millennia (refer back to page 102, this work). Cosmic catastrophism was explained as the dissolution of an order brought about by this slow change in the celestial sphere. Creation consisted in the establishment of a new celestial order.

It has, however, long been understood that most of mythology derives from primitive times, from those eras preceding the birth of writing. It is therefore difficult to accept that the primitive mind of ages past had already noted the extremely slow change of the pole, let alone that the change was understood. De Santillana and von Dechend were, of course, quite aware of this objection, so it is not surprising that they attempted to overrule it. As noted earlier, the discovery of the precession of the equinoxes has long been attributed to Hipparchus, one of the greatest astronomers and mathematicians of antiquity, who flourished sometime between 146 and 127 B.C. Yet\u2014or so the authors of Hamlet\u2019s Mill argued\u2014this does not prove that the phenomenon had not been observed prior to his time. Unfortunately, other than that their theory demands it, this premise is not warranted by the record and the authors in question must therefore stand accused of reading into that record what is not really there. What is worse is that even were we to grant that the phenomenon had been known since primitive times, it remains difficult to accept that this extremely slow change, the perception of which requires thousands of years, could have given rise to a world-wide belief in the cataclysmic end of all things\u2014with flood and fire and the shaking of the terrestrial globe it- self\u2014as these authors maintain. After all, when one pole star is displaced by another, no dis- aster ensues, either in heaven or here on Earth. More important is the fact\u2014and the authors in question were well aware of this\u2014that certain items of myth and ancient astronomical lore not only refuse to fit the precessional scheme of the equinoxes but, as we have seen, are notorious in not fitting anything else that we presently witness in our Solar System. With the vast amount of research that went into their work, they were bound to run headlong into the ancient notion that the planet Saturn had once played the role of pole star. Not knowing what to do with this datum, they ended up relegating it to the limbo of unacceptable data. All this has been brought up here because, needless to say, the authors in question were also bound to run headlong into what they themselves termed the polar axis. So how did they attempt to fit this entity into their precessional scheme? Somewhat ambiguously, they tell us that: \u201cThe rotation of the polar axis must not be disjointed from the great circles which shift along with it in heaven. The framework is thought of as all one with the axis.\u201d!58 As they explain on an earlier page, the axis mundi should be understood as \u201cthe equinoc- tial colure which \u2018accompanies\u2019 the slowly turning, wholly abstract and invisible axis along the surface of the sphere.\u201d '!5\u00b0 By this they meant the imaginary line running from Earth\u2019s geographical pole to the pole of the ecliptic, the centre around which Earth\u2019s axis revolves once every 26,000 years \u2014in other words, the imaginary pole around which the precession of the equinoxes takes place. What is highly interesting is that even they found this somewhat hard to swallow. As they tell us: \u201cThe abstract idea of a simple earth axis, so natural today, was by no means so logical to the ancients. ..\u201d160 That being so, why is it we find so many allusions to this pole in the mythologies of all races and in such varied dress?

Why would such an entity have been thought of as a pillar upholding the sky, visualized inter alia as the god\u2019s single leg or his erect penis? Why, indeed, unless it was something that was actually seen? But what was it that our ancestors saw? What was it that could have looked like a pillar supporting the sky? THE WHIRLING RAY FROM ABOVE As we have seen, the Egyptian Shu was described as light personified, which light acted as a prop of the sky. Osiris/Saturn was lauded as having occupied a position above the leg of heaven, which leg was described as a \u201cleg of fire.\u201d The Christian Sibyllines called the pillar of the sky a \u201cpillar of glory.\u201d We have seen that the rendering of the Egyptian Khu and/or khut, the heaven-sustaining column, utilizes a hieroglyphic character which translates as \u201cvertical streamers of light ascending the world axis.\u201d Through Sanskrit, we have even as- certained that this imperishable pivot, or post, was thought of as a fiery axis. The message seems clear enough: Although the direction of the light was interpreted differently by differ- ent peoples \u2014i.e., ascending or descending\u2014what the ancients purport to have seen was ex- actly what Hippolytus described as \u201cthe downward flow of light from above\u201d and as \u201ca ray coming from above.\u201d Even Plato had reason to describe it as \u201ca straight light like a pillar\u201d which has been understood as \u201cstretching along the axis of the cosmos,\u201d !6! while others have presented it as \u201ca cylinder of aetherial fire surrounding the axis.\u201d'\u00ae In other words, the phe- nomenon can be stated to have been a ray of fiery light which stretched all the way from the proto-Saturnian planet to Earth\u2019s geographical north pole, a pillar of light which appeared to support heaven and/or the proto-planetary orb of Saturn above it. But why a wind? What was there in this pillar of light that lent itself analogously to a wind, even a whirlwind no less? At this point one is bound to think of our posited circumstellar or placental cloud which, as we have seen in an earlier chapter, was inter alia described as a fog or foam which \u201cmoved round and round continually,\u201d a whirling \u201cprimeval void,\u201d a chaos which \u201cheaved\u201d and \u201cturned\u201d in darkness, the \u201ceternally revolving\u201d Tao of the Chinese, remembered by the Dogon as the spinning and dancing Amma, whirling around while organizing the \u201cworld\u201d out of chaos, and/or the Norse Aesir who established their seat on the \u201cwhirl-field.\u201d Does this not, in fact, accord well with Sanchoniathon\u2019s \u201cbreeze of thick air,\u201d to say nothing of Ehe- catl\u2019s identity as the \u201cwheel of the winds,\u201d illustrated so graphically by the interior design of a sliced conch shell which served as his symbol? Might it not therefore be that the analogous conception of the axis mundi as a whirlwind derived from its physical association with the whirling placental cloud in question? It is possible that the whirling placental cloud could have added to the analogy of the axis as a whirlwind but, for one thing, the circumstellar cloud would have appeared as a nebular disk around proto-Saturn, and not as a fiery pillar supporting that orb. For another, as we have also documented, ancient accounts seem to leave no doubt that the axis itself was seen to whirl\u2014and so has it been understood by past mythologists regardless of their blundering attempts in interpreting it. We shall have much more to say concerning the axis mundi and its destructive whirling antics as it evolved through time in future volumes,'\u00ae but enough has been said here to make the point.",

Right from day one, David Talbott had understood it as a luminescent stream of falling debris.! One reason I could not accept this interpretation came from the lack of recognizable cosmic material in Earth\u2019s Arctic regions. Let\u2019s face it, if the polar column was really composed of material ejected from a stationary planet located in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole, and since the column is posited to have existed for possible mil- lennia, such constant bombardment should have strewn Earth\u2019s Arctic regions with cosmic detritus.\u201d Since then, however, such material has been found in Arctic regions. Thus, for instance, \u201ca large fall of iron meteorites\u201d is now believed to have occurred in northwestern Greenland and the adjacent east coast of Ellesmere Island \u201cat some undetermined time in the past.\u201d It is now apparent that this cosmic iron \u201cwas discovered by the late Dorset people during the few centuries immediately preceding A.D. 1000, and small pieces of meteoric iron are found on Dorset sites of this period.\u201d? The meteoric iron from northwestern Greenland \u201cspread [through trade] at least as far west as Bathurst Island and Little Cornwallis Island and south to the northern part of Hudson[\u2018s] Bay.\u201d4 Even so, this is hardly the amount of cosmic mate- rial one expects to discover in Arctic regions, especially the area in and around the pole, if the debris had been raining down for millennia. Granted that no one has yet conducted a de- liberate search for such material, not enough has yet come to light from this area to satisfy Talbott\u2019s interpretation. Lynn Rose, on the other hand, compared the cosmic pillar to the flux tube which stretches between Jupiter and its satellite, Io.5 This is a stream of electrons\u2014a 5 million amp, 400,000 volt current, which translates into 2 trillion watts of energy\u00b0\u2014that flows in a wide arc from both Jupiter\u2019s poles to Io\u2019s. And, to be sure, I had toyed with this idea myself. But I soon dis- carded it because, while instrumentally detectable, and even photographable through exotic light, Io\u2019s flux tube is not optically visible. Meanwhile, Frederic Jueneman saw this axis as a colossal Rankine vortex, a cosmic tor- nado of planetary proportions, composed mainly of air and water vapor.\u2019 Although his model",

As Jueneman explained it, a Rankine vortex consists of \u201cnested cylinders of atmospheric gases and debris, one within another, each separated by density gradients caused by pressure, thermal, and perhaps electrical differentials.\u201d\u00ae But what would have been the cause of such a planetary vortex? As explained in a previous chapter, proto-Saturn\u2019s proximity would have raised a litho- spheric bulge in Earth\u2019s northern region, the shadow of which exists to this day. But, too, as there explained, Earth\u2019s hydrosphere and atmosphere would also have responded to proto- Saturn\u2019s attractive force. As Jueneman clarified, this gravitational force would have been en- hanced by the inertia inherent in the synchronous rotation of the planetary pair. Thus the gentle westerly winds of lower latitudes \u201cwould have turned into increasingly violent south- westerly gales\u201d at higher ones. In their northward spiral, aided by coriolis effects, these hur- ricane winds would then have towered above Earth\u2019s north polar region.\u00ae \u201cThe tremendous energy of forward motion in the air mass, imparted by the relatively close proximity of the northern celestial body, would have been converted into angu- lar momentum, increasing the velocity of this atmospheric maelstrom as it continued to accelerate into a tighter and tighter spiral. Finally, it would have sent a towering tornado-like polar column beyond the upper atmosphere and deep into space, ever reaching toward the northern body and forming a gaseous bridge in an attempt to span the void between.\u201d!\u00b0 The beauty of this model is that, unlike Talbott\u2019s flow of debris and Rose\u2019s flux tube, it readily explains the whirlwind motion attributed to the mythological axis mundi. But does it lend itself to a ray of light shining from above? After all, as we all know, tornadoes are any- thing but luminescent. They are, on the contrary, often very dark in appearance, some of them close to black, and definitely opaque enough to mask their internal lightning displays. And yet, external luminosities have been known to accompany tornadoes such as that which roared through St. Louis in 1959. This was described by various witnesses as having been of \u201ca continuous illumination,\u201d \u201ca flame-like flare right up from the horizon,\u201d and of \u201cthe shape of a broad sword.\u201d!! Others have been described as having a \u201cbeautiful electric blue light\u201d around them, or of looking \u201clike a searchlight beam\u201d extending down to the skyline.!? Jueneman himself attributes various electrical and light activity occurring within his planetary vortex'3 but, as he described it, much like the tornado mentioned above, the overall appearance of the planetary vortex would have been a \u201cbluish color\u201d of \u201cexquisite bril- liance...encased in a pale green envelope.\u201d '4 Granted that some of these effects stem from Jueneman\u2019s objective perceptivity, it is difficult to judge how much of them might also be due to his fertile speculation. For years I had accepted Jueneman\u2019s model as being a tentative valid prototype of the mythological polar column. Then, as the years went by, my interest shifted to the discovery",

But then I reasoned that if these jets can exist in both galactic and stellar magnitudes\u2014the difference in masses of which is enormous\u2014they might also exist in planetary dimensions. After all, the difference in scale between planets and stars is much less than that between stars and gal- axies.

It is the only way to pass high currents through a plasma for any distance. They are the invisible power transmission lines in space.\u201d !8 This brings to mind what Ralph Juergens had already noted in 1976, to the effect that \u201cthe column-like structure connecting Saturn and earth might have been of the nature of a steady electric discharge.\u201d!9",

Thus, for instance, in 1991, Andrew Gray discovered a bright strand, 150 light years long and a couple wide, near the centre of the Milky Way. Dubbed \u201cthe Snake,\u201d it is similar to other so-called \u201cthreads\u201d which have been discovered within the barrel-shaped region of space known as the Galactic Centre Lobe. Gray himself is of the opinion that the Snake \u201cis an electrical discharge, like a vast lightning bolt\u2014so vast that it just hangs in space, instead of disappearing as earthly lightning does.\u201d20 Meanwhile, the \u201ccorkscrew motion\u201d of the jet, as mentioned above, originates from the plasma\u2019s discharge system. As Thornhill succinctly explained: \u201c...plasma is highly structured, allowing electric currents to flow through it along magnetic field lines in the form of filaments, themselves twisted into ropes. Such twisted filaments are seen in the powerful jets issuing from the cores of active galax- ies, the tornadic clouds in the Lagoon nebula, the giant prominences streaming from the sun, comet tails, etc.\u201d2! Moreover, these twisted filaments are not static, but highly active vortices,?? thus ac- counting for the whirlwind motion endemic in the mythological axis mundi, But then, harking back to astral jets, is it known that these rotate? They surely do. Thus, for in- stance, data received from the Ulysses spacecraft showed that the twisting field lines connected to both poles of the Sun rotate with it. As Thornhill stated: \u201cAstral jets are a more active and visible manifestation of the same Birkeland currents.\u201d?3 This, of course, had already been ascertained by others, including Eric Lerner, who described such a jet as \u201ca plasma-pinching vortex filament.\u201d4 As he explained: \u201cThe vortices are produced by a phenomenon known as the pinch effect. A straight thread of electric current flowing through a plasma surrounds itself with a cylindrical magnetic field. This field attracts other currents flowing in the same direction. Thus the tiny current threads tend to \u2018pinch\u2019 together, drawing the plasma with them. The converging threads are twined into a plasma rope, much as water converging toward a drain generates a swirling vortex.\u201d 25 As indicated by the diagram on the previous page, a Birkeland current has the appearance of two serpents twisted about each other. And was not Boreas originally said to have possessed serpent tails for feet? (Even so, it should be noted that the serpentine structure of the axis mundi was not always visibly apparent, concerning which much more will be di- vulged in a future volume.)?6 Taking his cue from Thornhill, Talbott, too, latched on to the polar jet theory. Thus, in an interview conducted by AEON, he spoke of the \u201cgalactic scale plasma model\u201d which carried",

Here it is more than evident that, while willing to accept cosmic plasma jets as scaled-up versions of proto-Saturn\u2019s boreal column, Talbott was not ready to relinquish his original idea, and thus sought to amalgamate the two. Thornhill himself was not exactly hostile to this unification. Thus, when questioned about Talbott\u2019s interpretation of the polar column as a stream of fiery debris ejected toward Earth, he replied with these words: \u201cT think that for most of the time [the polar column] would have been like a spec- tacular auroral effect with very little matter transfer taking place. It is only when it transformed suddenly from a glow discharge to an arc that substantial matter would have been transferred between bodies.\u201d?? But can a Birkeland current transfer matter between bodies? Apparently so. As Thornhill explained: \u201cTo begin with, a rotating Birkeland current will form a tornado in an atmos- phere...Secondly, Eric Crew back in the 80s discussed how lightning usually acceler- ates positive ions vertically, creating a jet of hot moist air at the top of the discharge channel. In general terms the discharge compresses, heats and accelerates gases from a region of high pressure to a region of lower pressure. So bulk matter is moved by an electric discharge..\u201d3\u00b0 The tornadic quality of this sustained Birkeland current thus compensates for the loss of Jueneman\u2019s Rankine vortex model. Or does it have to? After all, with the tidal heaping of the terrestrial atmosphere due to proto-Saturn\u2019s proximity combined with its inevitable spiraling motion, the effects proposed by Jueneman should have taken place. Even the twisting of the axis can be accounted for through the workings of a Rankine vortex. Just as terrestrial tornadoes \u201coccasionally exhibit smaller counter-rotating vortices in close proximity to the primary whirlwind,\u201d so \u201con a much vaster scale, similar counter-rotating catenulate bolus flows would have snaked around the polar column in filamentary fashion.\u201d3! Could it not, therefore, have been that both causes, a planetary Rankine vortex and a sustained Birkeland current, have joined forces in producing the most colossal tornado Earth has ever experienced? Or would the electrical force inherent in a Birkeland current have overpowered the Rankine effect?",

After all, since it, too, follows Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field lines, Io\u2019s flux tube is also a Birkeland current.>? It thus turns out, after all, that Lynn Rose\u2019s postulate is not as unsound as | had originally assumed. As stressed earlier, however, Io\u2019s flux tube is not optically visible. Neither are the Sun\u2019s pole- ward emissions. As we have indicated, the mythological axis mundi, on the other hand, seems to have been very much visible. So are astral jets. Under what conditions, then, can a Birkeland current be made visible as a twisted ray of light? Needless to say, this might not be the right question to ask, especially since Birkeland currents have already been explained as invisible power transmission lines. Even so, as the plasma physicist Anthony Peratt stated at the Laughlin World Conference sponsored by KRONIA Communications on July 8, 2001, a Birkeland current can be made visible through the detritus it may collect about it. What is, however, really visible is the plasma through which these currents flow. To be sure, the plasma itself needs to be made visible. According to the electrical engineer, Don Scott, there are three different modes in which a plasma can operate, and these depend on the strength of the electrical current passing through it. In what is known as the dark current mode, where the electrical current is very low, the plasma will not glow and, therefore, remains invisible. It can only be detected through the measurement of its electrical activity with sensitive instruments. As Scott ex- plains, the present magnetospheres of the Solar System planets \u201care examples of plasma op- erating in the dark current mode.\u201d But if the strength of the electrical current is \u201csignificant,\u201d the entire plasma begins to glow, its brightness being naturally dependent on the strength of the current. If the electrical current is very high, the plasma goes into arc mode, during which it \u201cradiates brilliantly over a wide spectrum,\u201d with the current tending to form the filaments we are now becoming familiar with.*3 But, with a current of 400,000 volts, why does Io\u2019s flux tube not glow? As Peratt ex- plains, given the size of the system, this is not a \u201cterribly impressive\u201d amplitude. Translating into one mega-ampere, it even falls short of the seven mega-amperes conducted by Earth\u2019s circular auroras, made visible in Earth\u2019s northern and southern polar skies (even though this varies considerably).34 So that while it is the strength of the current passing through a plasma that accounts for its ability to glow, this strength has to be considered in relation to the size of the system that spawns it or, better said, in relation to the magnitude of the plasma itself. As Scott explains further, it is not the actual current in total amperes that is the real issue, but the current density, that is the amount of amperes per square meter.35 Actually, Peratt defines the situation even further and, at the risk of befuddling the lay reader, I hereby include his words for the benefit of the specialists. As he stated, whether a plasma glows or not relies on how energetic the relativistic electrons happen to be, plus the strength of the magnetic field, \u201cas this determines the intensity of synchrotron radiation the electrons beam towards Earth.\u201d3\u00b0 Those who are interested enough can consult his major work on the subject.37 As for our own proto-Saturnian polar column\u2014or \u201cpolar Birkeland current\u201d \u2014Peratt es- timates it to have probably carried something like \u201ca thousand mega-ampere into and out of",

Even if scaled down from stellar amplitudes to brown dwarf magnitudes, such jets would remain colossally active in their electrical mani- festation. It is more than probable that proto-Saturn\u2019s polar ray did originate as such a jet, but it is doubtful that it still retained its full potential by the time man came upon the scene. As Ken Moss suggested, it would have been more likely that the polar ray mankind re- members was, at best, the remnant of an original jet.3? And why not? After all, cosmic jets are known to fade. As Peratt disclosed in 1992: \u201cComparison of the integrated magnitude of the jet in M87 over the period 1934-1980 shows that the jet is variable and has been fading, more or less uniformly, by about 0.8 mag per decade between 1964 and 1980. The data imply that over the period 1952-1980, the total jet intensity fell by at least 2.5 mag. Comparisons of isophotes taken in 1964 and 1979 show no obvious differences in overall shape, apart from ef- fects of variation and noise. This indicates that the fading has affected the whole channel uniformly since 1964...\u201d4\u00b0 That jets fade is exemplified by our present Sun. The present poleward fields emanating from the Sun are so relatively weak that they operate in the dark mode. It is, however, doubt- ful that they always did so. As we shall soon see, brown dwarfs are believed to degenerate into giant gas planets. What this additionally means is that any jets spawned by such free floaters, already scaled down, would necessarily continue to decay in their electrical amplitude. We have no way of knowing at what exact phase in its evolution the proto-Saturnian brown dwarf star had ar- rived at during the time of man, prior to its entry into our Solar System. It, however, seems reasonable to assume that it was well along its way in its evolutionary transformation. Even the word \u201cjet\u201d might be misleading here where \u201ca sustained Birkeland current\u201d might much better fill the nomenclative bill. Despite all that, none of the above is to say that proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column was devoid of electrical activity, or that this activity failed to manifest itself in catastrophic dimensions. It should, however, be emphasized that, during man\u2019s existence on Earth, the polar column did not always exhibit its full tornadic force and, if we are to believe the mytho-historical re- cord, its twisted serpentine character was not always apparent. As seen from latitudinal dis- tance, very much as Thornhill intuited, the column would have appeared \u201clike a spectacular auroral effect,\u201d a tapering swath of light stretching all the way from proto-Saturn to Earth\u2019s north axial pole, a thing of beauty, even one of tranquility. Yes\u2014it would have been seen to whirl, perhaps even accompanied by an electric hum. It is even possible that ancient man at- tempted to approach it. But as one came ever closer to it, its vibrational envelope, to say nothing of an electrical feel similar to that encountered prior to a storm, would have been felt as a warning against further approach. THE ARCTIC DEPRESSION Such a planetary tornado, in the form of a rotating sustained Birkeland current, acting continuously over the same area in Earth\u2019s north polar region, scouring the land underneath, should have left an indelible scar. As it happens, small as it is compared to the Pacific and",

This bespeaks a different method from other oceans by which these sediments were collected. Charles Ginenthal understood this extra thick sediment as having been deposited by \u201ca global, oceanic tidal wave, flowing north- ward.\u201d42 This is a theory that has also been proposed by Jueneman.* As the latter indicated, however, such a flood, acting through waves of translation, would have been subject to Earth\u2019s rotation and would have swept from the equator in a colossal spiraling tide toward both poles, to say nothing of travelling back toward the equator.\u201c That being the case, these waves should just as easily have deposited their load of sediment in other land-encircled seas which would have been in their path, such as Hudson\u2019s Bay and the Black, Caspian, and Baltic Seas. Why, then, do we not find a similar thick load of sediment in these depressions? It is not that Earth\u2019s Arctic region has not been inundated by an immense flood\u2014which subject is also reserved for a future volume\u2014but this would have entailed an entirely differ- ent mechanism.*> Under the scheme presented here, it seems more reasonable to suppose that the thick sediment of the Arctic Ocean was created in situ by the constant scouring of the tornadic polar column. Also, as we have seen, Earth\u2019s boreal lithospheric bulge would have risen because of proto-Saturn\u2019s proximity. The tidal heaping of Earth\u2019s interior magma, however, would have actually been greater than at the surface. The thermal energy which would have resulted from the friction between this molten material and the enveloping crust would have enhanced the magma\u2019s mobility. This heated plastic matter would then have broken through the surface, causing a collapse of the crust. This is precisely what has been discovered in the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean, an area which \u201crepresents a regional collapse of the Earth\u2019s sur- face due to material being removed from the lower mantle.\u201d Even more recently, a swirling vortex of molten rock has been discovered 3000 kilome- ters beneath the North Pole.4\u201d Peter Olson and Jonathan Aurnou, then from the Johns Hop- kins University in Baltimore, Maryland, traced a flow of almost a quarter of a degree per year in a region some 2400 kilometers across. As Olson stated, the flow \u201chas the structure of a gi- ant hurricane.\u201d48 There is, incidentally, no point in claiming that these effects could have been caused by a different set of circumstances. What is stressed here is that this is precisely what our theory demands and, in that respect, the demand is met. In conjunction with the other physical evi- dence from the same region supplied in earlier chapters of this work (to say nothing of what we intend to add in coming volumes), the accumulating signs continue to build up in our the- ory\u2019s favor. One more problem yet to be solved concerns the manner in which Earth came to be locked within proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column. This, however, is going to take us on a final tan-",

FREE-FLOATING SUB-BROWN DWARFS As noted earlier, free wandering objects out in space are now being regularly discovered. The problem that is now facing astrophysicists is to determine whether most of these are planets or brown dwarf stars. As we have already seen, red and brown dwarfs are believed to \u201coccupy the middle ground between planets and stars.\u201d4? But the demarcation between stars, dwarf stars, and planets seems forever to be changing. To make matters worse, along the way a new class of free-floating objects were discovered that were \u201clighter than the lightest brown dwarf and heavier than the heaviest planets.\u201d> While less massive than brown dwarfs, some astronomers have questioned the use of the word \u201cplanets\u201d to describe them. Other problems have been listed besides their massiveness. Thus, to give one lame example, it has. been. cal- culated that the objects lurking in the globular cluster known as M22 \u201cmake up as much as 10 percent of the cluster\u2019s mass\u2014 too numerous to be wandering \u2018orphaned\u2019 planets.\u201d>! As if quantity has any bearing in the classifying of astronomical bodies. Alan Boss settled on the term \u201csub-brown dwarfs\u201d as a designation for these free-floaters. But, as Glen Schneider opined: \u201cGive a billion years of cooling and evolution, and these ob- jects may be indistinguishable from planets.\u201d52 This is primarily because it is believed that these objects are still contracting, \u201ccollapsing because of their own gravity.\u201d As Maria Za- patero-Osorio stated: \u201cWith time, they will look like Jupiter and Saturn.\u201d*? And did not Carl Sagan claim that, at least in the infrared part of its spectrum, \u201cit might even be correct to con- sider Jupiter a star\u201d?\u21224 Did not Mark Marley more recently note that: \u201cIf you line a mug shot of Jupiter up with these guys, it [i.e., Jupiter] is just a very low-mass brown dwarf.\u201d?55 And if Jupiter, why not then Saturn? All of which eliminates the objection concerning whether such a brown dwarf star\u2014or should we say sub-brown dwarf star?\u2014could ever turn into the planet Saturn as proposed in the present work. But what of the stated billion years said to be required for such a transformation? Unanimity among astrophysicists seems to be as rare as that among politicians. Thus, quite recently, when Goran Sandell discovered what he believes to be a \u201cmonster of a proto- star\u201d in the Cepheus constellation, near the emission nebula known as NGC 7538, he claimed that it, and others like it, could develop into a high-mass star \u201cin an astronomical blink of an eye\u2014only about 10,000 years.\u201d Back in 1977, astronomers focused on a disk-shaped object in the constellation Cygnus which was identified as an evolving star. Not only that, it was said that it \u201ccould well be a sun in the process of forming its own planets.\u201d Although the object, dubbed MWC 349, had been known since the 1930s, it was only now that they \u201crealized how unusual it",

(approximately 140 million miles) in diameter.\u201d>8 The strange thing about this, however, is that the star was believed to be \u201clittle more than 10,000 years old,\u201d even though it is believed to be still developing.>\u00b0 Stranger still was the rate at which it was developing. As stated in the periodical in question: \u201cSuch a process can sometimes take millions of years. But scientists will not have to wait that long to see how MWC 349\u2019s birth turns out. At the rate at which the disc is disappearing, it will be gone in a mere 100 years.\u201d\u00a9 Another star, FG Sagittae, has been said to be evolving so rapidly, it can actually be seen changing color as it moves from one theoretical phase to another. This star has already changed from blue to yellow over a mere 40 years. In view of these cases, it does not seem reasonable to assume that a body so much less massive would take a billion years to form. Coincidentally or not, 10,000 years is precisely the amount of time Sam Flamsteed claimed it would take a brown dwarf star to turn into a Jupiter sized planet. \u00a9 Additionally, it is believed by some that brown dwarf stars do not shine like stars, even though they generate enough heat to be detected by infrared-sensing instruments.\u00ae Stuart Goldman, on the other hand, seems to disagree when he speaks of \u201cthe visible [although feeble] light from such stellar embers.\u201d And, according to the editors of Astronomy, thirty newly discovered brown dwarf stars in Rho Ophiuchi are considered to be young enough to allow them \u201cto glow slightly brighter than their older relatives.\u201d\u00ae> This is precisely what we have been proposing for the brown dwarf star that was proto-Saturn in the past pages of this volume. In the interim, models based on the known characteristics of these dwarfs have been cre- ated in order to ascertain what these sub-stellar bodies actually look like. According to what Adam Burrows and his colleagues at the University of Arizona have called a \u201cfirst stab,\u201d based on the so-far limited data available, the conclusion has been reached that brown dwarfs can radiate in tints progressing \u201cfrom red to purple to magenta.\u201d If this turns out to be so, further conforming to our postulate regarding proto-Saturn\u2019s dull red hue, it would also coin- cide with Thornhill\u2019s claim that, besides its infrared emission, proto-Saturn would have radi- ated in ultra-violet light.\u00b07 Some brown dwarfs, it has been theorized, might even be cloudy.

There was a time when the formation of the Solar System planets was believed to have been due to material being drawn out of the Sun by a close passing star. This theory was however discarded in favor of the one now accepted in which the planets are theorized to have formed from the same gas cloud that collapsed through its own gravity to form the Sun itself. The material remaining after the Sun had formed is said to have continued to circle the Sun in its equatorial plane. Known as an accretion disk, this gaseous cloud continued to col- lapse into smaller clumps of matter, which clumps eventually aggregated into the planets and at least some of their accompanying satellites. There have been various other theories, but the accretion disk model became the one most widely accepted. When it comes to extra-solar systems, however, it has recently been discovered that the accretion process encounters difficulties. Thus, for instance, 90% of the young stars known to exist in the Orion nebula are surrounded by so-called accretion disks \u201cthat could potentially clump into new worlds.\u201d But, as Kathy Svitil noted, \u201cmaking a planet, it turns out, isn\u2019t all that easy to do.\u201d72 \u201cTRobert] O\u2019Dell christened these disks \u2018proplyds,\u2019 for protoplanetary disks. The name may actually be a misnomer, because these disks will evaporate within a mil- lion years, probably before planets can form.\u201d \u201cIntense radiation streaming from the nebula\u2019s brightest infant stars can stop the process in its tracks, says astronomer C. Robert O\u2019Dell of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. \u2018Radiation evaporates away the disks in a few hundred thou- sand years or less,\u2019 he says, leaving little or no time for planets to coalesce.\u201d",

So, likewise, in another extra-solar system which consists of two newly discovered plan- ets orbiting around 47 Ursae Majoris. What makes this system doubly interesting is that, un- like others previously discovered, it resembles mostly our own Solar System. One of these planets has been calculated to have a mass equivalent to 2.6 that of Jupiter, with the other containing a mere 0.76 of Jupiter\u2019s mass. The two planets therefore \u201chave about the same mass ratio as Jupiter and Saturn.\u201d Moreover, unlike other previously discovered extra-solar systems, the planets around 47 Ursae Majoris travel in circular, rather than elliptical, orbits. As Debra Fischer noted: \u201cNow, for the first time, we have a system that looks like it had a gentle dynamical history, similar to our own solar system.\u201d What is germane to our present topic, however, came to light when Greg Laughlin conducted a computer simulation of the system only to discover that \u201cthe gravity of the larger inner planet would jostle planetesimals in the star\u2019s habitable zone, preventing them from aggregating into a terrestrial planet.\u201d7\u201d Granted that the above may be considered unique examples, what about our own Solar System? Despite everything that had been claimed previously, back in 1960, W. H. McCrea\u2019s calculations indicated that planets could not have originated by aggregation between the orbit of Jupiter and the Sun.\u201d8 That same year, R. A. Lyttleton confirmed this assumption through his own calculations, again showing that the terrestrial planets, that is those within the orbit of Jupiter, could not have formed from the so-called accretion disk, but must have originated, by disruption, from the giant gaseous planets themselves.\u201d? Not everyone agreed, however, and, in 1979, Robert Jastrow was still claiming general ignorance when it came to the forma- tion of our Solar System\u2019s inner planets. As he wrote: \u201cWe can understand the birth of the giant planets of the solar system\u2014Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune...But the smaller planets\u2014the earth, Mars, Venus and Mer- cury\u2014their origin is a mystery. Somehow they collected out of tiny grains of matter and developed into full-sized planets. We may never know exactly how the earth and its sister planets were born.\u201d8\u00b0 By 1997, there were other astrophysicists who began questioning the theory of planet formation through the core accretion mechanism,\u00ae! so that it eventually had to be admitted that the accretion disk model falls flat on its face. By then, Uranus and Neptune were made to join the terrestrial planets as being impossible to have been formed through the accretion process. As Joshua Roth stated: \u201cPity Uranus and Neptune...no one can even explain why they exist.\u201d82 Agreeing with what has now become the general consensus, Roth declares that",

PLANETARY EJECTIONS When it comes to free floaters in space, one suggestion that has been proposed by Za- patero-Osorio is that \u201cperhaps these objects were ejected from their orbits from their original birth-places around the stars.\u201d85 Kailash Sahu was of similar opinion when he asked: \u201cCould they be planets torn from their parent stars...?\u201d86 In order to accept this, however, it needed to be shown that at least some of these free floaters, including brown dwarfs, must still be existing in orbit around some stars. News of such a brown dwarf did not take long in coming. Actually, there already had existed indirect evidence for several brown dwarfs orbiting around stars. But direct evidence did eventually filter through. This concerned a brown dwarf that Michael Liu and his colleagues discovered through the infrared adaptive-optics systems of the Gemini North and Keck telescopes. What these optic systems disclosed was a brown dwarf \u201cglowing faintly\u201d around the \u201cSun-like star\u201d known as 15 Sagittae.8\u2019 If nothing else, this takes care of the objection that the sub-brown dwarf that was proto-Saturn had no busi- ness residing, or settling, within the Solar System. Moreover, in comparison to our Solar System, the proximity of the brown dwarf in question to 15 Sagittae, \u201cas little as 14 astro- nomical units,\u201d would have positioned it \u201cbetween Saturn and Uranus,\u201d\u00ae not far from the very locality in which proto-Saturn itself finally settled. What is also interesting is that, according to Liu, this brown dwarf \u201cis too massive to have formed within a circumstellar disk like a planet.\u201d8\u00b0 While expressing his belief that \u201cthere are a diversity of physical processes that act to populate the outer regions of exoplanet systems,\u201d\u00ae Liu did not venture to say by what possible procedure such a dwarf could have been formed. Bo Reipurth, on the other hand, has proposed that \u201cbrown dwarfs begin their lives as protostellar \u2018embryos\u2019 just like ordinary stars\u2014but are gravitationally ejected from their parent gas clouds before they have time to grow.\u201d But what of the planets in our own Solar System? Planetary ejection had been proposed by orthodox astronomers long before the discovery of extra-solar planets. But this was an entirely different mode of ejection in which small planets were theorized to have been ejected by larger ones. In 1989, V. N. Zharkov and A. V. Kozenko revived this theory by again pro- posing that Jupiter must have ejected an \u201cembryo\u201d which then initiated the formation of Sat- urn, with further ejected \u201cembryos\u201d forming the planets Uranus and Neptune.\u201d In 1993, while questioning the very process of what he termed \u201cthe often-invoked idea that planets all condensed from a collapsed cloud of material in orbit around the Sun,\u201d Thomas Van Flandern proposed that cosmic bodies are emitted by a fast rotating parent.

Moreover, these emissions are initially jettisoned out in opposite and aligned directions, before being scattered in equatorial planes.% In fact, as we have seen, astrophysicists began speaking of planets \u201cbirthing punier planets\u201d purely as a matter of fact.% If nothing else, this demon- strates that alternative theories claiming that the Solar System planets have been ejected from other planets, so much ridiculed when proposed by Immanuel Velikovsky in 1950, have more than once been proposed by academia. The planetary ejection models developed by those mentioned above differ from each other, as they also differ from the one propounded in this work. Here we follow what is being discovered in our immediate spatial neighborhood, which continues to lend credibility to all those who have been stressing the plasma and electric nature of the Universe. In this respect, Halton Arp had the following to offer: \u201cThe assumption in cosmogony until now has been that all bodies in the universe condensed out of a uniformly spread, homogeneous medium and hierarchically ag- gregated to their current sizes. The evidence, however, is that proto-bodies are ejected from previously existing parent bodies and subsequently grow to their presently ob- served sizes. We have seen this strongly in the formation of galaxies, quasars and cluster galaxies and quasars...We are seeing it now in the formation of planets.\u201d95 But bear with me a wee longer while we back-track a little and I promise that, by the end of this last chapter, we will have managed to drive our ultimate peg into its hole. ASTRAL EJECTIONS Let us move far out in space into the dominion of galaxies. How are galaxies formed? The theory that new galaxies are formed by ejection from older galaxies harks back to 1957 as adduced by Viktor Ambarzumian,\u00ae who has long been regarded as a hero of science in his native Armenia. This theory has also been one of the mainstays of Halton Arp\u2019s career. Meanwhile, Hannes Alfv\u00e9n had for long suggested that plasma filaments, which have since been detected in space in quantum sufficit, are responsible for the formation of galaxies. An- thony Peratt, a former student of Alfv\u00e9n who later acted as his secretariat, and who has since become a renowned plasma physicist presently working at Los Alamos National Laboratory, decided to test Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s hypothesis. What Peratt discovered in the laboratory is that \u201cplasma filaments tend to twist up into what look like tiny spiral galaxies.\u201d Through computer simu- lation, he then scaled the action up to galactic size. Starting with two parallel filaments that are drawn together by their magnetic fields, and followed by what Eric Lerner called \u201ca pro- longed mating dance,\u201d the filaments merged into a single structure that correctly mimicked a bona fide spiral galaxy. Some of these simulations even produced the poleward jets seen emanating from real-life galaxies.\u201d As Lerner noted, computer simulations are one thing, the real Universe is quite another. It was, however, not long after Peratt had published his results that, in 1984, real filaments, more than a hundred light-years long, were observed at the centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way.

What\u2019s more, indirect measurements suggest that the strength of the mag- netic field in the filaments is far greater than what most astrophysicists thought possible on such a scale \u2014 but just about what Peratt\u2019s simulations predicted.\u201d%8 This then raises the question as to where the original filaments that form galaxies come from. Arp talks of \u201cnewly created matter\u201d as a matter of fact as so, also, do most astro- physicists. He, however, clarifies this by stating that \u201cit would not strictly be new creation but merely materialization of mass-energy from a different, perhaps diffuse location.\u201d 1\u00b0 \u201cOf course if the universe is operationally defined as everything that is detectable or potentially detectable there can be no such thing as \u2018new\u2019 matter. So when we speak of creation of matter we do not mean matter coming into our universe from some- where else (there is nowhere else) or from nothing. We must mean the transformation of previously existing mass-energy. Probably this means materialization from a pre- viously diffused state...\u201d 101 Granted, Arp does not speak of plasma, but his \u201cpreviously diffused state\u201d can be under- stood as just that. In fact, if we are to believe Alfv\u00e9n, plasma simply exists and, as we have seen, the entire Universe is actually composed of 99% of it. As Lerner paraphrased Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s argument: \u201cTn any plasma...tiny vortex filaments form spontaneously, and over time they grow larger and larger. Given enough time...there\u2019s no reason why cosmic filaments couldn\u2019t have grown to a length of billions of light-years. Gathering matter around them, the filaments could have organized the universe into a complex web of mag- netic fields, electric currents, and plasma\u2014a kind of cosmic power grid.\u201d 1 Once these filaments organize themselves into super-cluster complexes, they will have acquired so much mass that they will continue to be shaped by gravity as well as electric and magnetic fields. Gravity itself would break the filaments into \u201ccluster-size clouds of plasma, like beads on a string.\u201d Eventually, while being further compressed by new filaments, the plasma will again be broken up and, still according to Alfv\u00e9n, would then form galaxies. More than that, the sequence would continue to be repeated in steps, down to stars, planets, and their satellites.!3 It is for this reason that plasma is now considered to be the Funda- mental State of Matter. ! Or, as the renowned physicist David Bohm has been known to claim: \u201cPlasmas are the origin of everything.\u201d!05 Throughout the years, Arp has supplied a large body of observational evidence verifying the concept.!

Arp believes that stars are also ejected from gal- axies through their spiral arms. Actually, he believes the spiral arms themselves to be ejec- tions which then become \u201cthe loci of new star formation.\u201d!!\u00b0 But then, in discussing pole- ward ejections, he stresses that: \u201cThe tyranny of the observations is to insist on opposite ejection of extragalactic material as a ubiquitous process that operates on all scales.\u201d!!! If that is so, it would indicate that stars, too, could also be ejected poleward in opposite direc- tions along galactic plasma jets. And, in fact, Arp gives \u201ca vivid demonstration that the phe- nomenon of ejection of discretized bodies not only characterizes the birth of quasars and gal- axies...it also extends down into the realm of young star formation.\u201d !!? He does this by refer- ring the reader to the photographs of HH 34, which we have already encountered in a previ- ous chapter as a Herbig-Haro object displaying distinct knots in its jet. He then goes on to say that \u201cthere is an uncanny resemblance between the formation of young galaxies and the for- mation of young stars.\u201d!!3 And, to be sure, the belief that Herbig-Haro objects actually give birth to stars is now being preached as a matter of fact.!!4 If galaxies eject galaxies, and galaxies eject stars, all along their plasma jets in opposite directions in direct line with their axis of rotation, can stars eject dwarf stars through the same process? As we have seen, mainstream astrophysicists are now convinced that brown dwarfs can be ejected from star forming regions if not from stars themselves. As Reipurth phrased it, \u201cthe smallest [stellar] embryos will often be completely ejected from the star- forming region, destined to spend eternity alone as brown dwarfs.\u201d But also \u201csome brown dwarfs may be kicked out of the star-forming cores.\u201d 115 Speaking of the \u201cknots\u201d seen in the jet emitted by HH 34, Thornhill offered the follow- ing: \u201cIn my humble opinion, HH 34 is spitting out objects which might become individual brown dwarfs...\u201d 16 But if Arp is correct in that the ejection of cosmic bodies takes place at all scales, why should the next step down not be the ejection of planets from brown dwarfs? Thornhill, however, included gas giant planets with these brown dwarfs\u2014and more. As he explained, \u201cbrown dwarfs in the plasma environment of a brighter star become gas giants, spitting out rocky planets and moons from their interiors in an attempt to alleviate electrical stresses.\u201d When it comes to the direction in which these bodies are ejected, Thornhill then offered the following: \u201cWhether the spitting occurs in the polar or equatorial direction de-",

Thornhill, for one, finds brown dwarfs too electrically low-stressed to eject plasma jets.

In the case of HH objects, they are generally more active than our Sun, that is, more electrically stressed.\u201d !73 Arp himself does not treat of dwarf stars, brown or red. As we have seen, however, ob- servations have led him to believe that poleward ejection is a process that operates on all scales. So why not brown dwarf stars? True, no jets from brown dwarfs have so far been detected. Because of their low mass and feeble optical radiation, however, brown dwarf stars themselves are very difficult objects to detect. The detection of any existing jets emanating from them would be all that more dif- ficult. Even so, there are other emissions from brown dwarfs to be considered. Thus, even as the writing of this book is nearing the end, astronomical discoveries continue to accumulate in favor of its thesis. To begin with, on December 15, 1999, Bob Rutledge and his colleagues noted an X-ray flare emanating from the brown dwarf star designated LP 944-20, located in the constellation Fornax, estimated at 16 light-years from Earth. \u201cIt seemed fantastically bright and hard to believe,\u201d said Gibor Basri who then hailed from the University of Califor- nia at Berkeley. The flare appeared \u201cbriefly as an intense flash before fading out over the following two hours.\u201d !74 Less than a year later, a group of graduate students on a National Science Foundation summer program, working at the Very Large Array near Socorro, New Mexico, detected strong radio waves emanating from the same brown dwarf star. These emissions \u201cspiked up to 10,000 times stronger than what astronomers thought possible, indicating an intense flare of energy that may be similar to flares on the Sun,\u201d researchers said. The dwarf was found to emit these radio waves constantly \u201cwith intermittent flares that last for hours.\u201d As Shri Kul- karni stated: \u201cMany astronomers are surprised at this discovery, because they didn\u2019t expect such strong radio emissions from this object.\u201d!25 Or, as Eduardo Martin, from the University of Hawaii, phrased it: \u201cIt is not surprising that LP 944-20 has flares, but it is surprising that they are so bright in the radio [wavelengths]. The result is significant in telling us that brown dwarfs break the rules of stellar astronomy.\u201d !26 Call me naive when it comes to plasma physics, but do not these two items tend to throw a certain amount of doubt re Thornhill\u2019s claim that brown dwarf stars are too electrically low stressed to enable them to emit jets. Besides, as Arp discovered in a certain galaxy that he has studied, the radio jet, the X-ray jet, and the optical jet \u201care all coincident and define a precise ejection axis.\u201d !27 Radio and X-ray emissions thus seem to go hand in hand with optical jets. So if brown dwarfs emit both radio and X-ray emissions, the likelihood of their emitting op- tical jets does not seem that far fetched. Additionally, and more importantly, there are the so-called accretion, or circumstellar, disks to consider. As we have seen, the birth-place of planets these disks could not be. Most, if not all, of the stars emanating plasma jets, however, are also encircled by these disks. Do brown dwarfs exhibit such disks?",

The above becomes extremely important because bipolar outflows, or jets, are now be- lieved to be linked to these circumstellar disks.!3! More than that, circumstellar disks are be- lieved to be crucial in the formation of jets.!32 As one theory proclaims, it is \u201ca mixture of ions, atoms, molecules and dust\u201d raining onto circumstellar disks along magnetic field lines that accounts for the generation of jets. These magnetic field lines are then said to be \u201cpulled in\u201d from the perpendicular, or pinched. Centrifugal force then \u201cflings material outward along the lines.\u201d Finally, the \u201cinertia of the swirling material twists the field lines into a helix, which helps to channel the outward-flowing material in a vertical direction\u201d !33\u2014which is so descriptive of a Birkeland current. If the above turns out to be correct, the newly discovered disks surrounding free-floating dwarfs should act in like manner, and one can perhaps see the day when astral jets may yet be detected emanating from brown dwarf stars. And yet we have previously seen that Alfv\u00e9n believed the jets to have been generated by the induction of electric currents in the interstellar plasma toward the centre of galaxies \u201cwhere they turn and flow upwards along the spin axis.\u201d To use Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s own terminology, this current then \u201cshort-circuits\u201d and, dumping vast amounts of energy into the galaxy\u2019s core, ends up \u201cblowing a fuse.\u201d It is the blast from this \u201cfuse-blowing\u201d that propels the jets of plasmas up the spin axes of galaxies. Although Alfv\u00e9n was referring to galaxies, rather than individual stars or less massive bodies, is this method of generation really that much different from the one proposed above? Thornhill himself seems to accept both methods as being compatible. Thus, concerning Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s theory, he has stated that: \u201cOur Sun, Jupiter and Saturn, etc., all have equatorial plasmoids. It seems to be the normal state for spherical magnetized anodes in a galactic discharge. Only when the energy stored in those plasmoids becomes excessive will it switch to a polar jet (ac- cording to Alfv\u00e9n).\u201d !34 But then, in discussing the proposed circumstellar or placental cloud around proto-Saturn, he also had this to say: \u201cDwardu [Cardona] mentions proto-Saturn\u2019s accretion disk. Regardless of whether there was such a disk, in my opinion [it] would have nothing to do with accretion and a whole lot to do with expulsion. Whatever its origin, it would intercept electrical en- ergy and radiate in the infra-red. In fact it is the infra-red glow from a brown dwarf that is used to infer an \u2018accretion disk\u2019 rather than direct observation.\u201d !3>",

In any case, there seems to be no denying that circumstellar disks and astral jets go hand in glove, and that any body surrounded by such a disk is a prime candidate for astral jetting. Brown dwarf stars seem to fit that category. If, then, brown dwarf stars do emit jets, it is more than probable that Earth itself would have been ejected by the sub-brown dwarf that was proto-Saturn along its astral jet, or sustained Birkeland current, within which it remained trapped until well into the advent of man\u2014which would render the long forgotten Oskar Reichenbach\u2019s intuitive claim that Earth is \u201can offspring of Saturn\u201d!36 right on the mark.

But, relying on an old clich\u00e9, I hope no one will end up throwing out the baby with the bath water if such errors are discerned. I also reserve the right to amend what might in future be found to be amiss with the conclusions reached in this work. I will in no way be embarrassed if I have to retract whatever is found not to fit the general hypothesis presented herein. That is the way theories are supposed to be formed. That is the only way science can progress. I know this work will run its gamut of criticism. I am prepared for that. After all, if what I have presented bears any semblance to what really transpired in the past, the tenets of various sci- entific disciplines will have to be reconsidered. Such revisionist work will not sit well with the old guard. But, to use another old clich\u00e9, do not mistake me for a lonely voice in the de- sert. I am not alone in most of what I have so far presented. I belong to an ever-growing school of interdisciplinarians who have immersed themselves in the above and related stud- ies. The old guard will eventually pass away, as it always does. It is to younger minds that the future is bequeathed. In the meantime, I put a gun to no one\u2019s head, so believe what you will. The main problem with the reconstruction of these hoary events lies with plasma cosmol- ogy which, ironically, serves as the best evidence in favor of their occurrence. As in other matters touched upon in this work, once again, this is not to be wondered at. Despite Hannes Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s pioneering work in the 1930s, and Anthony Peratt\u2019s more recent seminal disclo- sures!, plasma cosmology is still in its infancy. As the latter confessed in 1992: \u201cBecause of their strong interaction with electromagnetism, plasmas display a com- plexity in structure and motion that far exceeds that found in matter in the gaseous, liquid, or solid states. For this reason, plasmas, especially their electrodynamic prop- erties, are far from understood.\u201d2 Granted that plasma science has progressed immensely since then, its exact behavior in relation to astronomy remains temporarily controversial. Worse still, proponents of the proto- Saturnian model are not all of one mind when it comes to the mechanics involved in keeping the configuration stacked up in linear formation. And this entails the exact nature of proto- Saturn\u2019s polar column. The main contestant of the specific nature of this column as adduced in the foregoing pages stems from the fertile mind of Wallace Thornhill whose knowledge of plasma physics ranks him among the best in the field. It behooves us, therefore, to take his objections seriously enough to comment at some length about them. Thus, for instance, not only does Thornhill not believe in brown dwarf jets, he even doubts the ejection of brown dwarfs from stars. True, as we have seen, he had previously stated that in his humble opinion, HH 34 is spitting out objects \u201cwhich might become\u201d indi- vidual brown dwarfs.3 A day later, however, he revised his opinion by claiming that such a",

Thus, speaking of the knots, or condensations, in astral jets, he rightly pointed out that these are light years away from the star that forms them. \u201cThe condensations of the HH 34 jet are easily resolved at a distance of 1500 light years.\u201d As he continued, in a similar Saturnian situation, at such a distance, it would have been impossible to see proto-Saturn at all, let alone as a distinct orb in Earth\u2019s north polar sky. Nor would it have been possible for it to have provided Earth with light, feeble or otherwise, let alone enough heat to generate and harbor life.5 What, then, can be said against this? Speaking of the plasma experiments he conducted, Alfv\u00e9n asked: \u201cIf we can extrapolate from the laboratory to the solar system, which is a hun- dred trillion times larger in extent, then why shouldn\u2019t plasma still behave the same way for the entire observable universe\u2014another hundred trillion times larger?\u201d\u00ae I point this out here because, if it is allowable to scale up from laboratory experiments to the Solar System, and from the Solar System to the Universe, it must then be allowable, as it really is, to scale down from stellar masses to brown dwarf stars and even lower to sub-brown dwarfs. As Don Scott pointed out: \u201cThe differences in scale (as Tony [Peratt] has tried to point out MANY times) are completely unimportant. They all work the same way.\u201d7 Scaling down, however, involves more than just size and mass. It also involves ampli- tude, and thus luminosity, as well as distance and even speed, to say nothing of time. All elements must be scaled down, and not necessarily all by the same percentage. Thus, when the knots in an astral jet are scaled down to sub-brown dwarf proportions, they will no longer be as bright as stars, but, at best, only as bright as the sub-brown dwarf that spawns them. And even then, this only holds true for the knot\u2019s initial inception. If the sub-brown dwarf that was proto-Saturn eventually turned into the gaseous planet we now know by that name, what is there against assuming that its knots would eventually turn into rocky terrestrial plan- ets? The light-years distance which separates jet condensations from their stellar parents would also then be scaled down to more modest stretches. Besides, does not Thornhill accept that proto-Saturn had been a brown dwarf star? Does he not himself interpret proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column as a sustained plasma discharge in the form of Birkeland current? And has he not also told us that astral jets are a more active and visible manifestation of the same Birkeland current? At the risk of befuddling the reader, this is the manner in which Thornhill extricated him- self from the above dilemma: \u201cInstead of being a small but normal stellar anode in the galactic discharge, and ac- cepting electrons, proto-Saturn would find itself a cathode, ejecting electrons, once it entered the Sun\u2019s more positively charged domain. Proto-Saturn was then no longer a star by definition. It was a comet! So it could not, by definition or physics, have de-",

I realize, of course, that this is a question that will leave astrophysicists aghast. And no, I am not claiming that comets are akin to stars. I am only here concerned with the fabric of their tails. So consider: It has now been conceded for some time that electricity and magnetism are central to the under- standing of what a comet really is.? The sunward spikes that some comets display have also been understood as electrical discharges '!\u00b0\u2014and would not these spikes, in conjunction with the tails, make for a similar situation to a bipolar flow?

Or, phrased differently, if a celestial body as puny as a comet can emit a plasma jet, why not a much more massive brown dwarf star? Does this not tend to emphasize Peratt\u2019s contention, mentioned above, that the differences in scale are completely unimportant? Do not all celestial bodies, as Scott phrased it, act the same way? Fair enough, as we have seen, everything is made of plasma but, as Ken Moss saw fit to re- mind me, apples are still not oranges. True\u2014but they are both fruit.

Despite this enormous difference in amplitude\u2014or, at least, a difference in opinion\u2014this would mean that, by the time man came upon the scene, Earth would have moved light years away with no possibility of leaving proto-Saturn within sight. What the time-lapse photographs in question actually indicate, however, is the displace- ment, and therefore motion, of \u201cpockets of gas\u201d within the jet, and not the motion of the jet itself. The knots, or condensations, in cometary tails also travel down the tail, and quick suc- cession of photographs indicate that they move at speeds up to 250 kilometers per second (540,000 miles an hour). Their motion, however, is erratic, with the acceleration \u201cturning on and off capriciously,\u201d as it varies with time. In fact, some knots have \u201cvery little speed or ac- celeration\u201d and, as Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan reported, their motion \u201cis as unpredictable as the weather.\u201d?3 Moreover, while cometary tails lengthen as they near the Sun, they do not travel away from the nucleus at velocities close to the speed of light. As scaled-down ver- sions of astral jets, their size and velocity of emission are reduced in keeping with their mod- est amplitudes. Worse still is that not all knots are seen to travel down astral jets. Comparisons of images from 1934 to 1980 of the jet spawned by M87 show that the knots, or hot spots, imbedded in it did not move. It cannot therefore be a law of plasma physics that knots in jets must travel. Of more importance to our study, when it comes to galaxies, Jayant Narlikar and P. K. Das showed in 1980 that \u201cas the particles in the ejected matter gain mass, they slow down in order to conserve momentum.\u201d In other words, they decelerate, and even come to a halt5 As Arp added: \u201cThe Narlikar-Das calculations apply to the most favorable case for escape from the ejecting galaxy\u201d and this material exits \u201calong the minor axis,\u201d which is the axis of rota- tion.26 We are here, therefore, speaking of galactic jets. And if galactic jets can decelerate, and even come to a halt, so, therefore, can stellar and sub-stellar jets.",

There does not seem to be a consensus concerning the answer to this most important question. Beginning with the sug- gestion of W. Baade and R. Minkowski in 1954, astrophysicists have assumed that astral jets constitute the actual ejections of matter.27 But, as Don Scott more recently noted: \u201cWe should not infer too much when we see the word \u2018jet\u2019 used (especially by as- tronomers). A columnar plasma can /ook like a jet. But these jets are not jet engine exhausts\u2014they are not massive flows of material. There may not be much stuff flowing in the jet\u2014except for an electric current. The \u2018stuff\u2019 may be getting squeezed while remaining relatively stationary within the \u2018jet\u2019.\u201d\u00b08 Or, to quote Peratt, who himself uses the word \u201cjet\u201d in relation to these astral emanations throughout his 1992 opus: \u201cGood as \u2018jets\u2019 are, [they] are not really jets. They are perceived as \u2018jets\u2019 of gas by astronomers and jets of gas do exist. But gas jets do not have the radiation properties, not even the features, of what we observe in space. \u201cJets also do not exist in plasma (charged particle beams) except when a very strong magnetic field is there to keep it from immediately flaring out...The term \u2018jet\u2019 is very popular and convenient if physically incorrect.\u201d?9 Which brings us back to Andrew Gray\u2019s \u201celectric discharge\u201d hanging out in space with- out dissipating, to say nothing of Thornhill\u2019s own sustained plasma discharge. Another objection that Thornhill raised is that \u201cbeing enveloped in a plasma vortex would not be conducive to pleasant living conditions\u201d3\u00b0 since this would have placed the entire Earth within the vortex of a world-wide tornado.3! And, to be sure, while astral jets are rela- tively slim or narrow in close proximity to the stars that spawn them, they tend to fan out farther away, \u201creaching a diameter wider than the orbit of Pluto.\u201d22 But this, again, is merely a matter of scale. Thus when we look at HH 34 we see quite distinctly that the width of the jet is not as wide as the diameters of the knots embedded within it. This is even more evident in HH 409, the jet emitted by HD 163296. These two systems show quite clearly that the widths of astral jets fall short of the diameters of the knots. In fact it is quite obvious that, were these knots to be thought of as planets, the jets would only encompass their polar areas, very much as posited for proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column in relation to Earth. Thornhill is also of the opinion that had Earth really been suspended within an astral jet emanating from proto-Saturn, all of terrestrial life would have been electrocuted.*? In view of the number of deaths of people reported to have been struck by that plasma discharge known to us as lightning, Thornhill\u2019s concern is understandable. This author was himself, at the age of twelve, blown off his feet by a lightning discharge. Fortunately it was not a direct hit. Di- rect hits by lightning discharges on persons who managed to escape with their life are not, on",

But, as Don Scott felt moved to clarify, this would only have ensued at ground zero and could never have applied to Earth\u2019s entire population.*4 Thornhill disagreed, stating that, as the voltage rises, \u201cthe plasma would extend to lower latitudes until the entire surface of the planet was covered.\u201d> He did not, however, provide an electrical justification concerning why the jet\u2019s voltage should rise. And then, again, we run headlong into Thornhill\u2019s belief that proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column was a sustained plasma discharge in the form of Birkeland current. Why, then, would this sustained plasma discharge not be subject to a similar, if not identical, rise in voltage? One of Thornhill\u2019s greatest objections has to do with the force that would have kept Earth aligned with proto-Saturn\u2019s rotational axis, which brings us full circle to the problem we started with. As he had it stated: \u201cNo one has shown how massive planets can be simply sus- pended above the pole of a star while enveloped in a plasma discharge.\u201d3\u00b0 And: \u201cMost of the planets so far discovered [in extra-solar systems] are gas giants that oc- cupy normal [that is equatorial] orbits close to their stellar parents. They are not sus- pended in polar stellar jets.\u201d37 \u201cIf [what Cardona claims was] the normal mode of planet formation we should not expect to find planets around nearby stars by looking for the stellar wobble caused by normal orbits.\u201d 38 But, for one thing, no one is advocating that planets can only be formed through poleward ejection. If Arp is correct in that some galaxies are ejected from other galaxies in a lateral di- rection, the same may probably be true for the ejection of some stars and planets. And then, also, no one is proclaiming that planets ejected in poleward direction must remain forever stacked. Obviously, the Saturnian system itself eventually relaxed into equatorial orbits once it entered the domain of the Sun. Meanwhile, because of their very lack of equatorial orbital motion, any extra-solar planets suspended in polar jets would not cause stellar wobble, and would thus be among the most difficult celestial objects capable of being detected. Thornhill claims that \u201cthere would need to be a persistent force to keep the planets sus- pended above a stellar pole.\u201d3? In discussing the E galaxies aligned along the jet of M87, Arp, too, found reason to ask an identical question: \u201cWhy had not these older galaxies drifted off this alignment into the general field in all this time?\u201d But as he himself recognized, \u201cbe- ing ejected along the minor axis [that is the axis of rotation] they have no angular momentum and simply remain along their original ejection direction.\u201d# This applies just as well to our hypothesized situation because, out in space, there would have been no nearby bodies that would have tended to exert their attractive influence on proto-Saturn and its entou- rage\u2014which is one additional reason demanding that the proto-Saturnian system would originally have been a free-floating sub-brown dwarf system outside our Solar System.",

As he has stated: \u201cBrown dwarfs are constitutionally and energetically best suited to produce rocky planets and moons.\u201d4! Neither is he adverse to the claim that proto- Saturn itself ejected planets which are now members of our Solar System, together with our own Earth,\u201d precisely as postulated in the present thesis. Exactly in what, then, does he dif- fer from us? One of the main reasons behind Thornhill\u2019s list of objections enumerated above becomes apparent when he compares proto-Saturn\u2019s characteristics to Jupiter\u2019s magneto- sphere. As he explained: \u201cThe polar column can then be imagined as having been equivalent to a hyperactive magnetospheric display of a size exceeding that of Jupiter\u2019s in which the Birkeland currents were visible. Remember that Jupiter\u2019s \u2018tail\u2019 stretches invisibly for half a bil- lion km to the orbit of Saturn.\u201d43 Jupiter\u2019s \u201cmagnetospheric display,\u201d which stretches into its billion km \u201ctail,\u201d is however equatorially wrapped around the giant planet. It is not a polar, or bipolar, emission. And this is precisely Thornhill\u2019s point because, as far as he is concerned, the planets were ejected from proto-Saturn in a lateral, or equatorial, direction. As we have seen, according to Thorn- hill, only on entry into the Solar System would the planets have aligned themselves in a lin- ear configuration as proto-Saturn dragged its entourage behind it much in the manner of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. Thus, still according to him, \u201cwe are talking simply about a linear arrangement of bodies where the only force between them is attractive.\u201d This would then conform with Talbott\u2019s contention that Earth had originally orbited proto-Saturn in a phase- locked equatorial orbit, concerning which no evidence was ever produced from the mytho- historical record, and against which enough objections have already been raised in the past pages of this work. Within the confines of Thornhill\u2019s scenario, it then becomes evident that proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column would also have come into being after proto-Saturn and its entourage invaded the Solar System. And it is this scenario that precludes him from accepting the pre-existence of proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column.\u2018 But, as Peratt stated on the strength of his plasma studies, \u201cthe column is the configuration out of which planets form so it should always have been there.\u201d Thus, when I brought it to Peratt\u2019s attention that, according to the mytho-historical record, proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column was one of two items\u2014the other being the celestial wa- ters\u2014which was never seen as having been created, he reaffirmed both our positions by as- serting that there is much quantitative evidence that tends to support this.47 Granted that we have been discussing emissions of vastly different amplitudes, might we not, after all, be embroiling ourselves in nomenclature? One thing we have surely learned is that the demarcation between stars, red dwarf stars, brown dwarf stars, sub-brown dwarf stars, and giant gaseous planets is simply one of magnitude. We have also been discussing knots, condensations, plasmoids, and planetisimals \u201cimbedded\u201d in astral \u201cjets\u201d when, in fact, these are terms that connote the same phenomena even if, perhaps, at different stages of",

Or where is the demarcation be- tween the members in this last class of objects? Other than amplitude, might we not be inad- vertently referring to the same, or associated, phenomena? Thus, when it comes to proto-Sat- urn\u2019s polar column, is it the term \u201cjet\u201d that Thornhill really objects to? Did he not, originally, himself refer to it as a \u201cjet\u201d? Would he rather that I refer to it as a sustained Birkeland cur- rent? Have I not referred to it as such? Does he not himself believe it to have been exactly that? Does not Moss\u2019 suggested remnant of a jet come close to filling the bill? Call it what you will, this cosmic emission, or sustentation, with or without the participation of a Rankine vortex, would have been the whirling ray of light from above which ancient man remem- bered as the single leg or phallus of the Saturnian deity, that axis of fire which he saw stretching down as a swath of light from the polar planet he venerated as his god. AN ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTION Thornhill\u2019s other objections, as enumerated above, must not necessarily be judged as be- ing invalid. My reluctance in accepting his convictions notwithstanding, he might yet turn out to be correct in some of his opposing contentions. While I feel confident in my own views, I will not be adamant about their acceptance. My honest opinion is that both his claims and mine, to say nothing of David Talbott\u2019s, should remain open to further investiga- tion until our presently opposing beliefs can be reconciled through further developments, and a better understanding, of plasma cosmology. Additionally, and to be fair, while the use of Halton Arp\u2019s data, as utilized in this work, seems to imply his endorsement of the Saturn thesis, I must confess that nothing can be fur- ther from the truth. On the contrary, as he has made clear to me: \u201c,..the biggest difficulty I see with matching the Saturnist interpretation of the his- torical records is the very long time scales needed for dynamical and material evolu- tion. Also I wonder how much the record reflects the world picture of the [ancient] priests who can be very illusionary and how much it represented the practical obser- vations of the citizens tilling the fields. Your point about independent myths agreeing across time and culture is the point that impresses me the most. But then I think of the unfortunate situation today when experts disagree totally when looking at the same replicable [astronomical] photograph.\u201d48 There is, however, nothing in the present volume that contradicts the posited time scales required by the evolution of celestial bodies. No date for the origin of Earth\u2014or proto-Sat- urn, for that matter\u2014has been proposed, and no date, or age, shall be. Neither will I offer anything concerning what Arp calls \u201cthe unfortunate situation today\u201d concerning expert dis- agreement on any subject. As for the consistency of the mytho-historical record itself, enough has been presented in these past pages (with much more yet to come in hopeful future volumes). Arp, of course, is not yet well acquainted with this record, having only come in contact with the Saturn thesis during one single conference sponsored by KRONIA Communications, which was held in Portland, Oregon, in September of 2000. This is not to say that he will necessarily accept the thesis, either in part or in its entirety, once he acquaints himself with the evidence in its favor. My only hope is that if he ever gets to read this work, he will at least consider it.",

        "main_text": "It is a somewhat different matter when it comes to Anthony Peratt who had also first come in contact with the Saturn thesis at the same world conference attended by Arp. While not entirely convinced during the conference, he soon showed interest right after the event through personal communications with David Talbott and Wallace Thornhill. Thus, during the proceedings of the KRONIA conference, held in Laughlin, Nevada, in July of the fol- lowing year, he had no qualms in stating that, because of scaled-up Birkeland currents, he was not surprised to hear of the Saturnian configuration or its attendant polar column.*? As Thornhill later reported: \u201cAccording to Peratt, the recognized authority on the subject, the plasma behaviour fits the detailed representations of the polar column perfectly. I am aware of the com- plexities of plasma discharge instabilities and am satisfied with Peratt\u2019s subsequent identification of the polar column with that phenomenon. The \u2018Peratt instabilities,\u2019 as they are now known, turn out to be far more complex than any of us could have imagined and therefore form an unbeatable test of the polar configuration model.\u201d \u00b0 What led Peratt to seriously consider the Saturnian, or polar, configuration theory was his own first-hand experience with plasma experiments at the Los Alamos National Laboratories, New Mexico. To begin with, having served as Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s secretariat, he was quite familiar with the latter\u2019s theories. Thus, during a lecture given at one of Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s \u201cNew Astronomy\u201d seminars at the University of California, San Diego\u2014circa 1980-1981 \u2014 Alfv\u00e9n had proposed that cosmic objects form in columns,\u00b0>! very much in the manner being here propounded. As Peratt later clarified, plasmoids are produced in an electrical discharge.>? And: \u201cPlasma cosmogony, via Alfv\u00e9n, provides the physics for the evolution of the plas- moids into planetisimals and eventually planets. These form like beads on a string.\u201d 3 It might be argued that one planet suspended beneath another, or beneath a sub-brown dwarf, can hardly be compared to \u201cbeads on a string.\u201d However, as those who are already familiar with the Saturnian configuration theory know, and as will be disclosed in future se- quels to this work, there were other planets besides Earth that were involved in the configu- ration in question. Even so, when questioned on the possibility of brown dwarf stars ejecting jets, Peratt\u2019s answer echoed Thornhill\u2019s with a resounding \u201cno.\u201d4 How, then, can this be compatible with his assertion that cosmic bodies form in columns like beads on a string? To begin with, plasma experiments have convinced Peratt that planets and their satellites can form entirely independent of any star.55 If nothing else, this would eliminate the neces- sity of searching for proto-Saturn\u2019s parent, a search that, even if one existed, would certainly prove futile in any case. But the question that this raises is: How, then, would strings of plan- ets form? The answer to this takes us back into Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s domain, concerning whom Peratt had this to say:",

An experiment conducted with an empty can of diet Coke, as explained by Thornhill, il- lustrates the phenomenon quite clearly. The can was placed in the centre of an electric coil through which a strong jolt of current was passed. The can instantly collapsed, catapulted into the air, and came down too hot to touch. The manner in which the can collapsed was through a pinching effect around its middle, thus forming an hour-glass shape. As Thornhill explains: \u201cThe response to the magnetic field [generated by the coil] occurred because the can is a metal and can conduct electricity. In space, plasma is a conductor and behaves in the same way. It is this response to the magnetic force, created by a universal or ga- lactic discharge, that efficiently coalesces and heats diffuse dust and gas embedded in plasma to form galaxies and stars, or constrains the narrow jets of active galaxies. It is this mechanism also which squeezes, heats, and jets material upwards against gravity in a powerful lightning discharge.\u201d 8 Or, in Peratt\u2019s words: \u201c[Cosmic bodies] are formed out of the original intersolar or intergalactic plasma through which the currents are flowing that causes the pinching of the plasma down to a dense state. Then, at least according to my book, or rather Alfv\u00e9n and the De- partment of Physics at the Royal Institute of Technology, matter accretes inwards to form \u2018planetisimals\u2019 and eventually planets.\u201d>? Still based on laboratory plasma experiments, this led Peratt to claim that Earth would have formed at the same time that proto-Saturn itself did. As deduced \u201cfrom laboratory framing pictures progressing in time\u201d and \u201cscaled to planetary dimensions,\u201d\u00ae! Peratt could add that: \u201cOriginally the plasmoids were all about the same size...But some accreted more ef- ficiently and then cascaded to smaller terrestrials from the Giant Plasmoids [or Gas giants] they had been...7his configuration could have been recorded anytime over the course of the development of man.\u201d\u00ae",

This would also explain his insistence concerning the pre-existence of proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column. Having spent his entire life immersed in plasma physics, it is not easy to counteract Per- att\u2019s claims. Even so, at this point, with so much yet to learn, a final verdict concerning the origin of the proto-Saturnian system would be premature. Whether cosmic bodies emit jets, or jets form cosmic bodies, remains temporarily unresolved. Whether the sub-brown dwarf that was proto-Saturn was ejected from a star, or whether it was formed independent of any star, remains outside the scope of the present work. Whether proto-Saturn ejected the plas- moid that was to become Earth, to say nothing of the possibility of other planets, poleward or otherwise, or whether proto-Saturn and its attendants all formed at the same time, will be dis- cussed more fully in the proposed sequel to this work. END OF ACT ONE In order to simplify the theory propounded in this work, our theses must now be ex- panded and reshuffled into a more appropriate chronological order. Hypothesis #1: That the present gas giant planet we know by the name of Saturn had pre- viously been a sub-brown dwarf star free floating in space outside the demarcation of the present Solar System. Hypothesis #2: That, from what can be deduced from ancient as well as primitive astro- nomical lore, Earth had once been a satellite of this proto-Saturnian sub-star, which, because of its proximity, loomed large in the sky as a distinct disc larger than the apparent size of the full Moon. Hypothesis #3: That, during this period, a nebulous entity, which our ancestors had diffi- culty in describing clearly, surrounded the Saturnian primary. We have conjectured this en- tity to have been a placental cloud, or circumstellar disk, surrounding the Saturnian orb in its equatorial plane. This entity seems to have been that to which the ancients alluded to as Chaos. Hypothesis #4: During this same unspecified period, the Saturnian orb was seen to float over an apparition which, to ancient man, looked like a sheet of celestial water, a cosmic ocean. Whether this \u201cwater\u201d was the same conjectural circumstellar disk, which would have had the appearance of a celestial whirlpool, an auroral manifestation, or a combination of both phenomena, is not now easily determined. Hypothesis #5: That, still according to ancient astronomical lore, during this indetermi- nate period, Saturn was the only visible celestial body in Earth\u2019s primordial sky.",

Hypothesis #7: That Saturn\u2019s immobility was due to the fact that Earth was stationed di- rectly \u201cbeneath\u201d Saturn\u2019s south pole and that, from Earth, Saturn therefore appeared to be permanently fixed in the north celestial sphere, the very place now occupied by the Pole Star. What this also means is that Saturn and Earth were linearly aligned with the both of them sharing the same axis of rotation. Hypothesis #8: That what appeared as a slow-twirling, relatively narrow beam of tapering light connected the proto-Saturnian orb to Earth\u2019s north polar region. This ray from above is interpreted as a sustained plasma discharge in the form of Birkeland current, a scaled down version, or the slowly deteriorating remnant, of a so-called plasma \u201cjet\u201d such as can be seen emanating from stellar, and even galactic, objects. Hypothesis #9: That, according to some of man\u2019s earliest memories, Earth was originally engulfed in what our ancestors persistently referred to as darkness. This was an age which, despite its remoteness in time, ended up etching itself indelibly in human consciousness. It was a time during which the Sun, the Moon, and the stars were not yet visible in the sky. Sat- urn ruled alone. Hypothesis #10: This age, we have also found out, could not have been one of total dark- ness, and that, in fact, mankind itself remembers that the Saturnian deity actually shed a feeble light. The terrestrial environment during this age was bathed in a perpetual twilight or, rather, a protracted dawn, which man remembered as the dawn of Creation. Hypothesis #11: That both Earth and Saturn were embedded in a plasmasphere centered on proto-Saturn, the opacity of which enabled proto-Saturn\u2019s radiation to be reflected toward all terrestrial latitudes. Hypothesis #12: Proto-Saturn\u2019s illumination, feeble as it might have been, together with the plasmasphere\u2019s opacity are recognized as the means by which the stars were kept from visibility. The Sun, needless to say, was still too far to be seen, while the Moon had not yet been captured by Earth. Hypothesis #13: There is also the possibility that, due to Saturn\u2019s former greater mass and rate of dimming, it might have been even warmer and slightly brighter in ages previous to the advent of mankind. Hypothesis #14: That, under the scheme described above, Earth would have received enough heat to sustain life. This heat would have radiated directly from proto-Saturn\u2019s close proximity about Earth\u2019s northern hemisphere. The southern latitude would also have received sufficient warmth, even if a feebler light, from the radiation that would have been reflected off the inner surface of proto-Saturn\u2019s plasmasphere with which Earth would have been en- veloped. In the northern hemisphere, this indirect radiation would have added to the direct heat and light received from above Earth\u2019s northern pole. Thus, during this time, Earth\u2019s cli- matic environment would have been one without seasonal change, luxuriating in one single season of eternal spring. (It should, however, be noted that Earth would also have been sub- jected to slightly different latitudinal temperatures.) Tropical and/or sub-tropical flora and fauna were thus able to thrive in Earth\u2019s northern region, even within the present Arctic circle, and the possibility exists that this flora and fauna originated in these regions before migrating to more southerly latitudes. Judging by palaeontological remains in Earth\u2019s geo- logic strata, this environment stretched back into the remote past, possibly as far as the Cre- taceous Period, definitely as far as the Paleocene Epoch of the Tertiary Period. Exactly what situation prevailed before that remains to be examined, but since Earth is postulated to have been a satellite of proto-Saturn from its very onset, it becomes evident that all past ages prior to the Pleistocene, including the origin of life, must be reconsidered under this hypothesized scheme. 491",

        "main_text": "Hypothesis #15: That, due to Saturn\u2019s immobility, and the absence of the Sun, ancient man had nothing at his disposal by which he could calculate the passage of time. Hypothesis #16: That, at a later time, Saturn shone much brighter than it had previously done, bright enough for ancient man to allude to it consistently as a sun. Hypothesis #17: That this primordial Saturnian sun shone during that time we today call the night. Hypothesis #18: That, at some point in time, as the Saturnian system drew closer to the Sun, the Saturnian plasmasphere changed its wavelength, thus robbing it of its former near- opacity. It was at this time that ancient man was able to catch a glimpse of the slowly ap- proaching Sun, at first appearing no bigger than a star, but growing ever larger and brighter. One question that pops up at this point, and one that I have often been asked, is: What was man doing during this time of free wandering through space? And my answer has always been: Nothing much. Men, women, and children went about their business, whatever that might have been, entirely indifferent to the Saturnian apparition towering above them. And why should they have paid it any heed? In our present situation, the Sun rises, traverses the sky, and sets. It appears red on rising, a blinding yellow throughout most of the day, and dims back to red on setting. The Moon also rises and sets, appears of an orange color and illusively larger when nearer the horizon, turning to yellow and then white as it gains height in the sky. Unlike the Sun, it can be seen, when seen at all, during both day and night. More importantly, it grows and diminishes as an expanding and contracting crescent, appearing as a full circular orb in between, and does so once every month. At times the Moon is seen passing in front of the Sun, causing a partial, annular, or total eclipse. At other times, Earth itself comes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow across the face of our lunar neighbor, thus causing a partial or total lunar eclipse. These are events that would have mesmerized our primitive ancestors, as in fact, in later times, they did. Prior to its actual shining as a sun of night, proto-Saturn would have been bereft of any such changes. Until that time, it did not even brighten and dim. It just hung there, doing nothing. True, had it to suddenly re-appear in this modern age, its towering apparition would awe us, but only because we are now used to a different sky. Those who were born, brought up, and lived beneath its splendor would have simply taken it for granted for the simple rea- son that it had always been there. As mentioned before, those who might have dared approach the shining ray from above would have first felt the wind that would have enveloped the far outer fringes of the plasma discharge; they would have heard the electrical hum emanating from it; and they would have experienced the prickling of their scalp and the hairs on their body due to electrical excita- tion. Both man and beast alike would have known better than to approach nearer. One could also ask: Did man even inhabit such northern regions in those far off times? Why not\u2014especially since the Arctic was the warmest place on Earth? Stone tools, similar to those retrieved in East Africa, obviously worked by man, have been unearthed in fifteen dif- ferent sites beneath the permafrost in present Siberia.\u00a9\u2019 Traces of Stone Age settlements, containing \u201cbone implements and arrowheads, as well as needles and axes skillfully fash- ioned from mammoth tusks,\u201d have been found in the New Siberian Islands.\u00ae Prehistoric petroglyphs depicting the \u201cwell-preserved incised outlines of whales and deer\u201d are still to be",

Only heaven knows what might still lie buried beneath the permafrost of these and other Arctic lands. Judging by what man has left us from those far off times, it becomes evident that he was not originally concerned with recording his past achievements or the events which shaped his life. But man did not completely forget what his condition had been like before the heavens changed. Among those who remembered were the descendants of the Peruvian Incas. As they eventually had it recorded: \u201cWhere we live now we see villages and cities; we see streams flowing down from the mountains, and being led this way and that to water our crops and our trees; we see flocks of llamas feeding on good grass with their lambs\u2014countless flocks. But in those days we lived where there were thickets and barren rocks; we had no llamas; we had no crops; we knew not how to make the waters flow this way and that way; we had no villages, no cities, no temples. We lived in clefts of the rocks and holes in the ground. The covering of our bodies was of bark or of leaves, or else we went naked in the day and without covering to put over us at night. We ate roots that we pulled up out of the ground, or else we fought with the foxes for the dead things they were car- rying away. No one bore rule amongst us, and we knew nothing of duty or kindness of one to another.\u201d This was the state of man\u2019s being as his world free-floated through space. But then came a time when man\u2019s environment drastically changed. There came a time when heaven brewed a new production. And it happened without warning. Coming ever nearer to our present Solar System, proto-Saturn finally came within the attractive clutches of the Sun. After aeons of uniform celestial sameness, an event finally transpired that was so stupendous, so unnerving, that it went down in history as Day One. The story of that glorious event, as also of what followed, will be told in the planned se- quel to this work. Stay tuned.",
