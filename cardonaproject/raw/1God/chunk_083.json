        "main_text": "“The filaments look like textbook examples of electromagnetic vortices, consisting of an outer layer of spiraling helices surrounding an inner layer of nearly straight threads. What’s more, indirect measurements suggest that the strength of the mag- netic field in the filaments is far greater than what most astrophysicists thought possible on such a scale — but just about what Peratt’s simulations predicted.”%8 This then raises the question as to where the original filaments that form galaxies come from. Arp talks of “newly created matter” as a matter of fact as so, also, do most astro- physicists. He, however, clarifies this by stating that “it would not strictly be new creation but merely materialization of mass-energy from a different, perhaps diffuse location.” 1° “Of course if the universe is operationally defined as everything that is detectable or potentially detectable there can be no such thing as ‘new’ matter. So when we speak of creation of matter we do not mean matter coming into our universe from some- where else (there is nowhere else) or from nothing. We must mean the transformation of previously existing mass-energy. Probably this means materialization from a pre- viously diffused state...” 101 Granted, Arp does not speak of plasma, but his “previously diffused state” can be under- stood as just that. In fact, if we are to believe Alfvén, plasma simply exists and, as we have seen, the entire Universe is actually composed of 99% of it. As Lerner paraphrased Alfvén’s argument: “Tn any plasma...tiny vortex filaments form spontaneously, and over time they grow larger and larger. Given enough time...there’s no reason why cosmic filaments couldn’t have grown to a length of billions of light-years. Gathering matter around them, the filaments could have organized the universe into a complex web of mag- netic fields, electric currents, and plasma—a kind of cosmic power grid.” 1 Once these filaments organize themselves into super-cluster complexes, they will have acquired so much mass that they will continue to be shaped by gravity as well as electric and magnetic fields. Gravity itself would break the filaments into “cluster-size clouds of plasma, like beads on a string.” Eventually, while being further compressed by new filaments, the plasma will again be broken up and, still according to Alfvén, would then form galaxies. More than that, the sequence would continue to be repeated in steps, down to stars, planets, and their satellites.!3 It is for this reason that plasma is now considered to be the Funda- mental State of Matter. ! Or, as the renowned physicist David Bohm has been known to claim: “Plasmas are the origin of everything.”!05 Throughout the years, Arp has supplied a large body of observational evidence verifying the concept.! Like some of the astral jets emanating from their centres, some galaxies also",

        "main_text": "exhibit knots in their spiral arms.!°’ Together with other evidence, this led Arp to believe that galaxies eject other, perhaps smaller, galaxies laterally along their plane of rotation.!°8 Other evidence, however, indicated that galaxies can also be ejected from galaxies along their cos- mic jets, that is along their axis of rotation, vertically from either pole. !© Stars, of course, are formed in galaxies. Arp believes that stars are also ejected from gal- axies through their spiral arms. Actually, he believes the spiral arms themselves to be ejec- tions which then become “the loci of new star formation.”!!° But then, in discussing pole- ward ejections, he stresses that: “The tyranny of the observations is to insist on opposite ejection of extragalactic material as a ubiquitous process that operates on all scales.”!!! If that is so, it would indicate that stars, too, could also be ejected poleward in opposite direc- tions along galactic plasma jets. And, in fact, Arp gives “a vivid demonstration that the phe- nomenon of ejection of discretized bodies not only characterizes the birth of quasars and gal- axies...it also extends down into the realm of young star formation.” !!? He does this by refer- ring the reader to the photographs of HH 34, which we have already encountered in a previ- ous chapter as a Herbig-Haro object displaying distinct knots in its jet. He then goes on to say that “there is an uncanny resemblance between the formation of young galaxies and the for- mation of young stars.”!!3 And, to be sure, the belief that Herbig-Haro objects actually give birth to stars is now being preached as a matter of fact.!!4 If galaxies eject galaxies, and galaxies eject stars, all along their plasma jets in opposite directions in direct line with their axis of rotation, can stars eject dwarf stars through the same process? As we have seen, mainstream astrophysicists are now convinced that brown dwarfs can be ejected from star forming regions if not from stars themselves. As Reipurth phrased it, “the smallest [stellar] embryos will often be completely ejected from the star- forming region, destined to spend eternity alone as brown dwarfs.” But also “some brown dwarfs may be kicked out of the star-forming cores.” 115 Speaking of the “knots” seen in the jet emitted by HH 34, Thornhill offered the follow- ing: “In my humble opinion, HH 34 is spitting out objects which might become individual brown dwarfs...” 16 But if Arp is correct in that the ejection of cosmic bodies takes place at all scales, why should the next step down not be the ejection of planets from brown dwarfs? Thornhill, however, included gas giant planets with these brown dwarfs—and more. As he explained, “brown dwarfs in the plasma environment of a brighter star become gas giants, spitting out rocky planets and moons from their interiors in an attempt to alleviate electrical stresses.” When it comes to the direction in which these bodies are ejected, Thornhill then offered the following: “Whether the spitting occurs in the polar or equatorial direction de-",

It may be in the form of one or a number of gas gi- ants...A gas giant, in turn, due to either internal or external electrical disturbances may fission, spitting out its core, to give rise to the highly condensed planets, moons, asteroids, comets, etc.” !!8 I shall not burden the reader with the detailed electro-mechanics behind this new ejection theory, which involves plasma pinch effects, electrical charge separation, Peratt instabilities, and the probable electrical nature of gravity itself, since these are best understood by experts in plasma physics. OBJECTIVE EARTH That brown dwarfs can “spawn their own planetary systems” is now being considered by mainstream astronomers.!!9 Thornhill, too, feels “confident that brown dwarfs ‘give birth’ to fully formed planets (and maybe expulsion disks).”!2° The question concerns the manner in which such planets are expelled. In discussing poleward eviction, Arp is also of the opinion that “the phenomenon of ejection of discretized bodies not only characterizes the birth of quasars and galaxies,” but that “it also extends down into the realm of young star formation.” He then asks: “Does the same mechanism evident in the formation of these young stars ex- tend to the formation of planets?” !2! That question he answered in a private communiqué he wrote to this author: “The HH objects indeed show luminous knots obviously ejected in a line from a cen- tral source. I included a picture of HH 34 in Plates 8-19 and 8-20 in my book ‘Seeing Red.’ The purpose of that inclusion is to demonstrate that such ejections happen on both galactic and stellar scales in the universe. I personally consider the outrageous possibility that planets could originate in such fashion also.”'22 But from brown dwarf stars? Do brown dwarfs emit jets? Thornhill, for one, finds brown dwarfs too electrically low-stressed to eject plasma jets. As he outlined the problem: “We have no evidence that brown dwarf stars are active enough to produce polar jets. The examples we have of polar jets, from AGNs to HH objects, suggests unusual",

        "main_text": "electrical activity. In the case of HH objects, they are generally more active than our Sun, that is, more electrically stressed.” !73 Arp himself does not treat of dwarf stars, brown or red. As we have seen, however, ob- servations have led him to believe that poleward ejection is a process that operates on all scales. So why not brown dwarf stars? True, no jets from brown dwarfs have so far been detected. Because of their low mass and feeble optical radiation, however, brown dwarf stars themselves are very difficult objects to detect. The detection of any existing jets emanating from them would be all that more dif- ficult. Even so, there are other emissions from brown dwarfs to be considered. Thus, even as the writing of this book is nearing the end, astronomical discoveries continue to accumulate in favor of its thesis. To begin with, on December 15, 1999, Bob Rutledge and his colleagues noted an X-ray flare emanating from the brown dwarf star designated LP 944-20, located in the constellation Fornax, estimated at 16 light-years from Earth. “It seemed fantastically bright and hard to believe,” said Gibor Basri who then hailed from the University of Califor- nia at Berkeley. The flare appeared “briefly as an intense flash before fading out over the following two hours.” !74 Less than a year later, a group of graduate students on a National Science Foundation summer program, working at the Very Large Array near Socorro, New Mexico, detected strong radio waves emanating from the same brown dwarf star. These emissions “spiked up to 10,000 times stronger than what astronomers thought possible, indicating an intense flare of energy that may be similar to flares on the Sun,” researchers said. The dwarf was found to emit these radio waves constantly “with intermittent flares that last for hours.” As Shri Kul- karni stated: “Many astronomers are surprised at this discovery, because they didn’t expect such strong radio emissions from this object.”!25 Or, as Eduardo Martin, from the University of Hawaii, phrased it: “It is not surprising that LP 944-20 has flares, but it is surprising that they are so bright in the radio [wavelengths]. The result is significant in telling us that brown dwarfs break the rules of stellar astronomy.” !26 Call me naive when it comes to plasma physics, but do not these two items tend to throw a certain amount of doubt re Thornhill’s claim that brown dwarf stars are too electrically low stressed to enable them to emit jets. Besides, as Arp discovered in a certain galaxy that he has studied, the radio jet, the X-ray jet, and the optical jet “are all coincident and define a precise ejection axis.” !27 Radio and X-ray emissions thus seem to go hand in hand with optical jets. So if brown dwarfs emit both radio and X-ray emissions, the likelihood of their emitting op- tical jets does not seem that far fetched. Additionally, and more importantly, there are the so-called accretion, or circumstellar, disks to consider. As we have seen, the birth-place of planets these disks could not be. Most, if not all, of the stars emanating plasma jets, however, are also encircled by these disks. Do brown dwarfs exhibit such disks?",

        "main_text": "In 2001, a team from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics discovered “warm, dusty disks around some of the free-floaters—evidence, they claim, that the objects are stars.”!28 A year later, “gas-and-dust disks around substellar objects” were being spoken of as a matter of fact.!2° This not only fits our postulated circumstellar or placental cloud which ancient man saw circling around proto-Saturn, the mythological data concerning this phenomenon, which I first presented to the public in 1993,'° could have actually been used to predict such clouds around brown dwarf stars. The above becomes extremely important because bipolar outflows, or jets, are now be- lieved to be linked to these circumstellar disks.!3! More than that, circumstellar disks are be- lieved to be crucial in the formation of jets.!32 As one theory proclaims, it is “a mixture of ions, atoms, molecules and dust” raining onto circumstellar disks along magnetic field lines that accounts for the generation of jets. These magnetic field lines are then said to be “pulled in” from the perpendicular, or pinched. Centrifugal force then “flings material outward along the lines.” Finally, the “inertia of the swirling material twists the field lines into a helix, which helps to channel the outward-flowing material in a vertical direction” !33—which is so descriptive of a Birkeland current. If the above turns out to be correct, the newly discovered disks surrounding free-floating dwarfs should act in like manner, and one can perhaps see the day when astral jets may yet be detected emanating from brown dwarf stars. And yet we have previously seen that Alfvén believed the jets to have been generated by the induction of electric currents in the interstellar plasma toward the centre of galaxies “where they turn and flow upwards along the spin axis.” To use Alfvén’s own terminology, this current then “short-circuits” and, dumping vast amounts of energy into the galaxy’s core, ends up “blowing a fuse.” It is the blast from this “fuse-blowing” that propels the jets of plasmas up the spin axes of galaxies. Although Alfvén was referring to galaxies, rather than individual stars or less massive bodies, is this method of generation really that much different from the one proposed above? Thornhill himself seems to accept both methods as being compatible. Thus, concerning Alfvén’s theory, he has stated that: “Our Sun, Jupiter and Saturn, etc., all have equatorial plasmoids. It seems to be the normal state for spherical magnetized anodes in a galactic discharge. Only when the energy stored in those plasmoids becomes excessive will it switch to a polar jet (ac- cording to Alfvén).” !34 But then, in discussing the proposed circumstellar or placental cloud around proto-Saturn, he also had this to say: “Dwardu [Cardona] mentions proto-Saturn’s accretion disk. Regardless of whether there was such a disk, in my opinion [it] would have nothing to do with accretion and a whole lot to do with expulsion. Whatever its origin, it would intercept electrical en- ergy and radiate in the infra-red. In fact it is the infra-red glow from a brown dwarf that is used to infer an ‘accretion disk’ rather than direct observation.” !3>",
