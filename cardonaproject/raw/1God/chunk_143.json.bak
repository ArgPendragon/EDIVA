        "main_text": "More than that, another of Vishnu’s various epithets is Mahakala,'® which translates as “Great Saturn.” Yet one more epithet of Vishnu is Darunah, a name derived from daruna, meaning “terrible.” In the Garuda Purana, however, Daruna is given as a name for Saturn.” Finally, the name Shaurih is shared by both Vishnu and the planet Saturn.\" There is therefore little doubt that, regardless of what Vishnu’s avatars turn out to be, the primal god himself was remembered as a personification of the planet Saturn, which connec- tion, as we have just seen, was tendered through various interconnecting equations. Now the Linga Purana contains a myth, in the form of a parable, which tells how Dhruva became the Pole Star\"? According to this parable, Dhruva was placed at his station by Vishnu. Moreover, Vishnu impressed on Dhruva that the abode in which he placed him had formerly been his. “This abode,” Vishnu is made to state, “is mine, the greatest, the steady splendid abode.” The same parable, in slightly different guise, is also contained in the Bhagavata Purana, where Dhruva is described ascending to the highest pole “to the exalted seat of Vishnu, round which the starry spheres forever wander...” '* We can thus see that it was the belief of the Hindus that the polar station had been Vishnu’s, that is Saturn’s, before it became Dhruva’s, that is the Pole Star’s. Even more intriguing is the fact that, elsewhere, we learn that Dhruva had previously been one of the names of the Saturnian sun god himself. Thus, the word dhruva means “fixed, firm, stable, permanent, constant, unchangeable”'*—which is an apt name for the Pole Star. Another Sanskrit word with similar meanings of “fixed, firm, unalterable, imper- ishable, indestructible, undecaying” is akshara.\" It is therefore noteworthy that one of Vishnu’s epithets is an amalgam of these two words— Dhruva-akshara. '” We have seen that, according to the Linga Purana, “Shaniscara, the slow-moving Saturn, is [called] Yama” —a name that was also borne as an epithet by Vishnu. It is interesting, then, that, as Warren tells us, Yama, too, once occupied the north celestial polar station. In his treatment concerning the north polar placement of various deities, he wrote: “That the East Aryans had the same idea is also evident from the Laws of Manu. Among this people Yama—the same as the Iranian Yima—was the first man. His first abode...was at the North Pole...”\"* And, like their Iranian counterparts, and others from other parts of the ancient world, the Hindus also faced north for divining purposes.\"",

As Warren tells us: “The oldest traceable worship among the Chinese is that of Shang-te [or Shang-ti], the highest of all gods...Shang-te is usually...described as the god of heaven. But his proper place of abode, his palace, is called Tsze-wei. And if we inquire as to the meaning and location of Tsze-wei, the native commentators upon the sacred books inform us that it is ‘a celestial space about the North Pole’.”\"” Thus we find it stated that “Shang-te’s throne is in Tsze-wei, i.e., the Polar Star.” And: “Immediately over the central peak of Kwen-lun appears the Polar Star, which is Shang-te’s heavenly abode.” Shang-ti’s title was The Holy and Propitious Prince of the North Pole.'” One of his symbols, upon which he is sometimes depicted as standing, was the tortoise. The tortoise is also sometimes accompanied by a snake. It is therefore noteworthy that the sym- bolism of the tortoise and serpent goes at least as far back as the Han dynasty and was used as an emblem for the northern region of the world.” More than that, as Lord of the Centre, Shang-ti was also revered as Huang- ti,“ who is perhaps better known as the Yellow Lord’® or Yellow Emperor. % The Yellow Emperor has long been acknowledged to be the representative of Saturn. When it comes to ancient Chinese lore, however, we need not merely rely on the mytho- historical record. Their astronomy echoed the same message. Thus, for instance, the Chinese referred to the Pole Star as T’ien-Tchou which, appropriately enough, means “Pivot of the Sky.” Stars which are close to the Pole Star were also referred to as “pivots.”'* The same name was additionally applied to two stars in the constellation Draco” and, since Draco had been the polar constellation around 2300 B.C., some authorities have concluded that this proves that Chinese observational astronomy dates to at least that remote time. Be that as it may, the term “pivot” for these Draconian stars fits in with their former polar, or near-polar, location. What has baffled commentators on ancient Chinese astronomy, however, is the fact that the planet Saturn is given the name Tchou-niou-tchi-chin, which translates as “Genie [or spirit] of the Pivot,” since this is tantamount to calling Saturn “the Soul of the Pole Star.” That, to the Chinese, the planet Saturn once occupied the north polar center is actually well known. As Jan Sammer indicated: “According to the Han historian Ssuma Ts’ien, the planet Saturn ‘corresponds to the center ... Saturn was placed at the pole, and the entire stellar sphere was said to",
