I will not here comment on the validity, or otherwise, of Hall’s particular scenario. I merely note that, regardless of the mechanism proposed by Hall, what he described is pre- cisely what later happened to Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. And so—enter Wallace Thornhill who proposed just such an analogy. To begin with, like Hall and Talbott, Thornhill was also of the belief that Earth originally orbited Saturn equatorially.®? And, like Hall, he was of the belief that this earlier system was stretched into its co-axial formation only on entering the Sun’s domain of influence. Granted, as already noted, the Shoemaker-Levy 9 event was a transient one. But, according to Thorn- hill, so, too, was the axial-coupled Saturnian system. To quote him: “We have seen graphically how an assemblage of orbiting bodies can become strung out in a line with the recent dismemberment of Comet Shoemaker-Levy [9] by the in- fluence of Jupiter. That model takes care of the polar Saturn configuration (which I consider to have been short lived but spectacular.)”®? “The break-up of the components of [Shoemaker-Levy 9] under the influence of Ju- piter may provide an object lesson for the formation of the Saturnian polar configura- tion, as compellingly reconstructed from ancient sources.” ®4 Unlike Hall, however, Thornhill did not see Jupiter as the cause of the Saturnian Sys- tem’s dismemberment. Instead, he credited our present solar primary “as Saturn’s gravita- tional sphere of influence shrank on approach to the Sun.” As he explained: “The polar con- figuration seems to have been a spectacular transitory arrangement between the break-up of the original Saturnian stellar system” and its capture “by our current Sun.”85 And: “It therefore seems that the spectacular Saturnian polar configuration...was created when its planetary system was disrupted by the Sun in a manner similar to that when Jupiter disrupted comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 into a ‘string of pearls.’ Such an arrange- ment is unstable and, therefore, transitory.”®° “Once inside the heliosphere, proto-Saturn would have exchanged charge with the solar wind at an ever increasing rate as the charge density increased radially toward the Sun. This, I think, would explain why the linear formation was maintained on the",

        "main_text": "long journey to the inner Solar System. It was a dynamic equilibrium maintained by proto-Saturn’s linear acceleration.” ®” How short-lived was this transitory system? Thornhill would not vouch for “thousands of years” but “maybe only a few centuries.”®8 Accepting Talbott’s postulate that “Saturn seems to have wandered in the sky before assuming a fixed polar station,” he presented two possi- bilities for this errant motion. As he himself adduced: “This could mean either that the pre-existing polar configuration was disturbed or that Saturn’s [satellite was] dislodged from [its] phase locked Saturnian equatorial [orbit] by the increasing influence of the Sun...and moved into the polar configura- tion.”89 Faced with that choice, Thormhill then opted for “the second option” as being “more likely.”9° Four years later, however, Thornhill had reason to revise his valuation of the co- axial system’s time span. As he then stated during an interview: “When it comes to estimating the duration of the polar configuration, the best that can be done is to look at the relative velocities of nearby stars. If we take, for the sake of argument, that the relative radial velocity between proto-Saturn and the Sun averaged 10 kilometers per second, it would have taken proto-Saturn about 45 years to cover the 15 billion kilometers to the inner Solar System.”9! He, however, also added that this forty-five year period was “merely an order-of-magni- tude calculation. As he said: “It could have taken much longer, but I don’t think it likely to have been much shorter.” 92 Thornhill’s minimum forty-five year period was better than Spedicato and Del Popolo’s maximum of three months for the duration of the Saturnian co-axial system but, when other parameters are taken into account, not by much. To begin with, as Thornhill’s interviewer found reason to comment: “The one thing that bothers me in all this are those 45 years. Okay—so you say it could have been much longer. Unless I am mistaken, however, I doubt that you would be thinking in hundreds, let alone thousands, of years. And yet, Saturn’s linear for- mation left such an indelible wound on the human psyche—leading to the birth of re- ligion, complete with human sacrifice, the scars of which remain with us till the pre- sent—that it is difficult to believe this was the result of a short transient event. Would 45 years—at best a person’s life-time—or even a hundred, account for the universal mass of mythological material we have at our disposal concerning the event in ques- tion? Would it have been enough to scar humanity for the rest of its existence on Earth?3 To which Thornhill replied:",

Meanwhile, the celestial effects as viewed from Earth would have been so dramatic that it seems to have completely overshadowed even the growing appearance of the Sun as this loomed closer. I’m not able to say how long it would have taken for the Saturnian configuration to have had the lasting influence it has had on the human psyche. I have tried to visualize the apparition in the sky, and I think it would have been psy- chologically overwhelming and disturbing. I imagine that all it would have taken would have been one generation of exposure to that sky for it all to become ‘im- printed’ on mankind.”94 To say the least, this was not a satisfactory answer. As Jueneman, in agreement with Thornhill’s interviewer, noted, “the idea of a 45-year-long excursion into the inner Solar System wouldn’t begin to impress mythological engrams on the psyche of the human survi- vors.”95 In reply, Thornhill did hedge a little. “There are too many unknowns at present,” he wrote, “to pin down the duration of the polar configuration to 50 years, 100 years, or 200 years.” But would even 200 years have been enough for the permanent scarring of the hu- man race? My own main objection to such a short length of time during which the Saturnian system sustained itself in axial alignment, however, has more to do with the paleontological evi- dence than with the time required for such engraphic impressions. As detailed in a previous chapter of this work, this state of affairs stretched back into the remote past, possibly as far as the Cretaceous Period, definitely as far as the Paleocene Epoch of the Tertiary Period. And even if one were to grant a reduction in time of these geological ages, there is no way in which they could be reduced to a mere 200 years. Even Thornhill would balk at that. There is, however, one possible way in which Thornhill’s scenario could be made to ac- commodate the palaeontological data, and so I present the last tentative scenario before driving home. I do so not to play the role of devil’s advocate, but in an endeavor to leave no possible solution unaccounted for. An original Saturnian system with Earth in a phase-locked equatorial orbit around it ala Hall and Thornhill’s hypothesis would satisfy the message of the mytho-historical record as well as the palaeontological data if the present terrestrial north polar region would have faced Saturn. Under this condition, Saturn would still have appeared stationary in Earth’s north celestial pole providing Earth with the required north polar temperature demanded by the southward radiation of fauna and flora from the Arctic region. Earth’s original axis of rota- tion would thus have passed through points in the present equatorial latitude. At this point, one might even ask: Why not adopt this system—which is basically Rose’s model with some modifications—and leave it at that? Would this not be more believable than having Saturn and Earth sharing the same axis of rotation? The problem with this is that, in a change from a phase-locked system in equatorial orbit to a later co-axial formation, Earth would have had to undergo a series of drastic changes. Its gravitational lock would have had to be broken only to be re-installed in an entirely different mode; its orbital speed would have had to come to a halt; its axis of rotation would have had to shift by 90°; and its rotational speed would have had to increase. To all this must be added the acquisition of an equatorial bulge due to the increase in Earth’s rotational speed. Each",

        "main_text": "one of these changes on its own would have entailed catastrophic destruction on Earth re- gardless of the speed with which they would have occurred. Acting in concert, abrupt or otherwise, these changes would have resulted in an even more colossal upheaval the gravity of which would boggle the mind. They even belittle Ashton’s previously mentioned gargan- tuan cataclysms, making it doubtful that life would have survived on Earth. It is not that cata- strophic signs are absent from Earth’s geological strata somewhere near the Age of Saturn but, regardless of their extension, these nowhere show signs of the dimensions demanded by the totality of the above mentioned terrestrial changes. And then, when all is said and done, why bother with this proposed change from one type of system to another when, as seen from Earth, nothing would have appeared to change in the celestial sphere? After all, as seen from Earth, Saturn would have ended up motionless in the north celestial sphere just as it would have been prior to the change from the earlier system to the later one. Besides, what is there in the mytho-historical record that can be interpreted in favor of such a change? As we have seen, Talbott is of the opinion that “the earliest remembered con- dition was that of phase lock.” What led him to this? As we have also indicated, still according to Talbott, a phase-locked Saturnian system is “the best explanation for the initial MOTIONLESSNESS or INACTIVITY of Atum-Ra” and that this initial inactivity “seems to suggest the motionlessness you would get from a phase lock of a satellite to its primary.” But, unless I have badly missed something, there is nothing in the mytho-historical record that differentiates between an earlier type of Saturnian inactiv- ity or “motionlessness” and a later but different sort of “motionlessness” or inactivity. All that the record proclaims is that Saturn and/or its anthropomorphic deity was motionless and/or inactive in Earth’s north celestial pole. No change is indicated. In his own objections to Talbott’s postulate concerning the placement of Jupiter behind Saturn, Thornhill had declared that: “The principle of parsimony of hypotheses suggests that we don’t introduce another massive body into the system if there are no reports of it during the transition of the proto-Saturn system from a primordial configuration into a polar con- figuration.”®” Would it not, then, be just as parsimonious in not introducing a different Sat- urnian system since no indications of it can be inferred from the human record? Would not this be in harmony with the scientific principle of Occam’s razor which specifies that entities and events must not be needlessly multiplied? What, then, of Talbott’s insistence concerning the previous wandering of Saturn prior to its eventual stationary establishment in Earth’s north celestial sphere? As Talbott himself well knows, this constituted a postulate which I had for long contested. In the end, however, due to continuing research, I finally ended up accepting it. Not only had I been looking in the wrong place, due to some sort of blind spot I had even misconstrued some of the clearest messages. As it turned out, and as it had been apparent to Talbott from the start, the message of the human record, in this case, turns out to be unequivocal. What, then, to make of this event? Actually, Thornhill had already supplied the answer himself—but he disregarded it. As already noted, when faced with the postulate of Saturn’s early wandering, he presented two possible scenarios to account for it. “This could mean either that the pre-existing polar con- figuration was disturbed,” he wrote, “or that Saturn’s [satellite was] dislodged from [its] phase locked Saturnian equatorial [orbit] by the increasing influence of the Sun...and moved into the polar configuration.” While he opted for the second proposition as being the “more",
