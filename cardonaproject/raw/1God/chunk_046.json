The real shape of Earth, as now deduced, is better described as a triaxial spheroid rather than an oblate one and, as Desmond King-Hele, who conducted a study of the phenomenon, had to admit: “No one has yet satisfactorily explained why the ‘stem of the pear’ is at the north rather than the south ...”* To be sure, King-Hele offered the suggestion that “the al- ternate melting and solidifying of the south-polar ice down through the ages may well have had some influence.” How this melting and solidifying of ice could have resulted in a northern lithospheric bulge, however, has never to my knowledge been demonstrated. True, King-Hele was here appealing to glacial rebound, but it must be kept in mind that the melting and re-solidifying of glacial ice occurred simultaneously in both the north and south poles. Glacial rebound should therefore also have been simultaneous. So why would this isostatic rebound create a lithospheric bulge only in the north? Frederick Hall proved more astute when he pointed out that: “[{The phenomenon] poses a question which, though obvious, is virtually never asked. What pulled Earth out of shape from above its north pole? “* Now it is true that Earth’s bulge has been measured at only 10 meters (33 feet),°> al- though others have vouched for as much as 18 meters. This might not be considered much of a bulge but, as a residue, or remnant, of a former greater uplift of land, even meters are of significance. As Hall indicated: \"The small dimensions of this shift indicate the pull was short term (as in centuries to millennia) rather than eons. Furthermore the effect is relaxing, and in geological terms the distorting influence must have been remarkably recent.”*° Leroy Ellenberger, an avowed antagonist of the Saturn thesis, found fault with this theo- retical base. As he advised me, any “tidal bulge that would have been raised would not have had time to relax since the disruption [of the Saturnian system].”\"’ “Fred Hall cites the 18",

How does he know how far Saturn was from Earth in order to deduce the height of Earth’s tidal bulge under its influence? How does he know how long this tidal bulge would have existed? And how does he know when the Saturnian configuration disrupted? I, for one, had never as much as hinted at these pa- rameters and, without knowing any of these quantities, nothing can be said concerning the height of the original bulge or to what extent it should have relaxed by now. (Besides, as El- lenberger himself knows, and as others have pointed out,” it was not just the positioning of Saturn above Earth’s northern pole that was responsible for raising the world’s lithospheric bulge. There were additional forces which came into play, but it would be premature at this point to go into all that.) And then, is it just the northern bulge per se that we should be concerned with? What about the fact that Earth’s crust is generally thicker in the northern hemisphere than it is in the southern? Sure enough, this has been explained as arising from the additional fact that “most dry land exists north of the equator,”” but it has never been asked why this should be the case. Exponents of the continental drift theory look at the configuration of Earth’s land masses and conclude that the continents must have once been joined together. I look at the same con- figuration and see something else. I do not, by this, deny continental drift and plate tectonics. But consider: Two of the biggest continents on Earth, and India also, taper toward the south pole. None taper toward the north. The highest percentage of Earth’s land masses, as noted above, occurs north of the equator; the highest percentage of the Earth’s oceans, south of the equator. In the extreme north, the continents come together at the “top” of the world to form a circle which is filled with the Arctic Ocean. As if to counterbalance this, in the extreme south we see that it is the oceans which come together at the “bottom” of the world to form a circle which is filled with the Antarctic continent. Earth’s axis passes from the centre of the Arctic Ocean to the centre of Antarctica. Is this merely fortuitous? Is it merely by chance that Earth’s land masses are mainly congregated in the north? (As to whether or not the Arctic Ocean existed during the era of Saturn’s proximity, I shall leave to a future work.) There is another problem to consider. Encircling the Arctic Ocean is a blanket of detritus known as muck. This area is so vast it actually covers one seventh of Earth’s land surface.” This muck is composed of deep-frozen “goo with silt, sand, pebbles, and boulders, often with masses of preserved, semi-decayed, or fully decayed vegetable and animal matter.” This frozen mess lies on low level plains.

The Russians, who own the major land areas covered by this substance have conducted prolonged studies on it for [over] half a century, and have in some places drilled down to over 4,000 feet but still without reaching solid rock.” Although we will have much more to say about the formation of this muck in a future work, the problem we wish to focus on here is this: From what heights did this material erode? As the writer in Pursuit pointed out: “...the lands now blanketed with this material must at one time have been much higher above sea level...”* But: “To suggest that the uplands from which this stuff came were once much higher and had a steeper run-off is begging the question and doesn’t help at all. Yet there is the bloody muck lying all over the lot and to enormous depths. It has to be accounted for.’ One additional fact to consider is that no such muck exists at Earth’s south pole. THE NATURE OF TIDAL FORCES One might now well ask: Since the Moon also has one side perpetually facing Earth, should it not also exhibit a tidal bulge on that hemisphere? As a matter of fact, it does. This was discovered by orbiting Apollo spacecraft using “a laser device to measure accurately the heights of features over much of the lunar surface.” What came to light is that the Moon, rather than being a perfect sphere, is actually slightly egg-shaped, with its narrow end point- ing toward Earth. This lithospheric bulge rises 2 kilometers above the lunar surface. Unlike Earth’s northern distortion, this is a “living” bulge, not the remnant of one. Even so, as Har- old Urey noted, this lunar ellipticity “is some seventeen times as great as would be calcu- lated from present tidal forces.” What Urey is saying here is that Earth’s pull on the Moon",

        "main_text": "is not powerful enough to raise this lunar bulge. By the same token, however—and this might come as a surprise to some readers— neither is the Moon’s gravitational pull powerful enough to raise oceanic tides.” And yet it does. Another objection raised by Urey is that it “is difficult to believe that the interior of the Moon can support such stresses for geological periods of time.”*' That may be so, but the bulge is there, so that no matter what forces came into play to raise it, the “interior of the Moon” does presently support it. There is no point in saying that this is impossible. Moreover, as Keith Runcorn admitted, under present conditions, the lunar bulge “would have disappeared long ago.”” For that reason, some authorities have been claiming that the lunar bulge is not raised by tidal forces, but by some other unknown mechanism. However, while this is not the place to go into this particular subject, the height of the lunar bulge would conform rather well if it was formed relatively recently, even more recently than the terrestrial one, under conditions other than those presently postulated. One other thing to keep in mind here is that, given what we know, or think we know, about tidal forces, Earth is bound to tidally affect the lunar surface, and that this effect is bound to manifest itself on the lunar hemisphere facing Earth. So that if the lunar bulge in question is not the result of Earth’s tidal attraction, where, then, is the manifestation of that force? Now, as it happens, Ellenberger has had reason to raise further objections to our hypothe- sis concerning Earth’s lithospheric bulge. As he had it stated: “...were the miniscule northern bulge manifested in the geoid truly of tidal origin as claimed, then the geoid would not be pear-shaped, but would instead be a prolate el- lipsoid, with the bulges at north and south. This follows from the elementary fact that tidal bulges express themselves on both the near and far side of the subject body, as with the lunar tide which occurs twice a day...” Roy Gallant succinctly explained the phenomenon in the following words: “Gravitation, remember, weakens as distance becomes greater. So the Moon tugs with greater force on that side of Earth facing the Moon, with less force on matter at Earth’s center, and with the least force on Earth’s far side. A second tidal bulge thus forms on the far side where a hill of water is ‘left behind’. Since this water is farthest away from the Moon, it is tugged with the least force.” The fact that lunar tides affect Earth’s oceanic waters twice a day is due to Earth’s rota- tion as it catches up with the secondary tidal bulge. But even this is nothing but an idealized",

        "main_text": "version of the real situation as assumed by astronomers and physicists.* It is not, for in- stance, entirely true that oceanic tides occur twice daily. There are many areas which are af- fected by only one tide per lunar day.* Even so, why did not Earth develop a secondary bulge at its south pole? Actually, who can say it did not? To begin with, the hydrosphere is one thing, the litho- sphere is something else. Water, being a liquid, responds much easier to tidal forces than does the solid lithosphere. And then, with the pull from the stationary Saturn being weakest at Earth’s south pole, a secondary bulge at that location would have been much lower than the northern one. Who is to say that a southern bulge did not form under Saturn’s constant pull and that this bulge, being much lower than its northern counterpart, has since completely settled down? Of course, we can never know whether such a southern bulge ever formed. But then, is it adamant that such a southern bulge should have formed? There is no secondary bulge on the Moon counteracting the one facing Earth. But because this lunar bulge has been disqualified as a tidal one, we look for a better example. I therefore point to Phobos, one of the Moons of Mars, an irregular chunk of rock measuring a mere seventeen miles across its longest axis. It, too, exerts a gravitational pull on Mars and, yes, it, too, raises a slight bulge on that planet.” Because Phobos orbits the planet faster than Mars is able to rotate, this Martian bulge tends to lag behind—but there it is, and there is no opposing secondary bulge to counteract it. But then how much do we really know about tidal forces? We know so little about them that we cannot even predict the tide for any point on an ocean.* Oh yes, we can forecast the tides for all principal ports and other shore lines, but “these are not computed from general theory...but from analysis of tidal records over a long period of years at the particular port concerned.”® There is also no point in appealing to Isaac Newton’s laws because the Newtonian scheme fails to explain these vagaries.” As James Gilluly and his associates pointed out: “These and many other facts make it clear that the tides are not a simple direct response to the vertical component of the moon’s gravitational pull, which is really far too small for ef- fective lifting of the water masses anyway.”*' Granted that these words were written in 1951, in the interim nothing much has changed in that respect So what, then, is the bottom line? From the little we know about tidal forces, the Sat- urnian model we have been investigating still demands that a lithospheric bulge would have been raised at Earth’s north pole, and that this bulge would have subsided somewhat once Earth’s linear alignment with Saturn was broken. The remnant of such a northern lithospheric bulge exists to this day. We can therefore safely claim that this demand is met.",
