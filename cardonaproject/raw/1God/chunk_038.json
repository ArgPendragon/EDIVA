        "main_text": "Jerusalem, but also as Bét (or Bit) Sulman.”48 The designation “House” —i.e. Bét(h)—for cities in Palestine is, of course, quite common. Easily coming to mind are such cities as Beth- aven, Beth-El, Bethlehem, Beth-haran, Bethshemesh, Beth-horon, Beth-eden (in Syria), Beth-peor, Beth-shan, and many others. Lewy himself explains such place names as due to the one-time existence of sanctuaries each of which was dedicated to the deity there named.*9 Thus, Jerusalem would have been referred to as Beth Shulman because a temple of Shulman would have existed there. Lewy’s conclusion was that a temple of Shulman supplanted an earlier one dedicated to Shalim but that it did not last for long. During the same period, the name of the city changed from Urusalim to Bet Shulman; but, with the destruction of the Shulman temple, the name of the city reverted back to Urusalim. This would explain why the name Bet Shulman never be- came popular.°° Needless to say, this was all conjecture on Lewy’s part. For one thing, Lewy himself ac- cepted that Shalim and Shulman(u) were slightly different versions of the same deity,>! so that no replacement of sanctuaries need enter the picture. Nor need the name Bet Shulman have ever supplanted that of Urusalim since, in effect, the meaning of both names is theolog- ically, even if not philologically, synonymous—the former meaning “House of Shulman,” the latter, as we have seen, “Founded by Shalim.”>? It is thus more than possible that Bet Shulman was merely another designation for Urusalim, the one derived from Assyrian, the other from Chaldean sources. The Chaldean name passed into Hebrew; the Assyrian did not. The one became popular; the other not. In any case, whether called by the very name of the god (Salem); referred to as having been founded by him (Urusalim/Yerushalem); or simply called his city (Bet Shulman); it re- mains obvious that the city we call Jerusalem was named in honor and dedicated to the god Shalem/Shulman.°*3 Indications that this god was worshipped there can be traced at least to the time of Israel’s United Monarchy.* Also rendered Shulman or Shulmanu,°> this god’s name gave Jedidiah, son of David and king of Israel, his more popular name of Solomon. Rendered Shlomoh in Hebrew, this monarch’s name has also been stated to have been derived from shalom, which, as everyone knows, does, inter alia, mean “peace.” (Compare also the Arabic salam and Maltese sliema.) The probability, however, is that both the monarch’s name and the word for “peace” derived from the name of the god. As Roy Rosenberg tells us, Slomoh (Shlomoh) means “belonging to Salim”5” Biblical theophoric names derived from Shalem are common including the names of kings of Israel and Judah. Among such names we find: Shallum, Shelemiah, Shelomi, Shel- emi (or Shulamit), after whom Immanuel Velikovsky named one of his daughters, and elemoth.",

        "main_text": "Outside of the Old Testament, we find this theophoric name adopted by Shalamanu, King of Moab.°S It also appears in the name of Shalmaneser, a name borne by more than one As- syrian king. Perhaps less known is the fact that Salummati was an epithet of the great Assur- nasirpal.5? As a god, Shulman was worshipped in Nineveh and, under the variant Shulmanuha or Shulmanuhi, is found mentioned in Assyrian tablets.© Shulman is known to have had a feimine counterpart named ShulmanituS!—but also Shala.® This goddess—but not Shulman —has been identified with Astarte and Ishtar, both personifications of the planet Venus. Moreover, Assyrian sources define Sulmanitu (the same as Shulmanitu) as distar Urusilimma which Michael Astour has rendered “IStar of Jerusa- lem.” That this goddess was known in Jerusalem is verified by her laudation in the famous Song of Solomon in which she is referred to merely as the Shulammite.®5 The sacrifices performed in Solomon’s temple were referred to in Hebrew as she- lamim—the plural of shelem. Usually translated as “peace offering(s),” R. de Vaux is of a different opinion in that shelamim “implies the idea of a tribute offered to God...”® If this is correct, the god in question must originally have been Shalem. As they appear in cuneiform, the words salummatu and salummati are usually thought to signify “brightness” and “splendor” respectively.” As epithets, these descriptive terms were applied to Enlil (Saturn), Nergal (Mars), and Nabu (Mercury). On their own, they throw no light on the real identity of Shalem. Who, then, was this god? Very much like other names of Saturn, Shalem (or Salim) meant “the Stable One.”© Solomon’s name, “belonging to Salim,” can then be translated as “belonging to Saturn.” David, his father, must have been very partial to the Saturnian deity for not only did he name Solomon in his honor, but also his first-born son, \"Amnon, which means “belonging to *Amin—i.e. the Stable One,” and even his third, AbSalom, which means “the Father is Salim.” It can now safely be said that Jerusalem was the City of Saturn, a conclusion that was additionally reached by Lewis Greenberg.7! (And did not Isaiah himself refer to Jerusalem as the city of justice,”2 which justice, in Akkadian kittum, we have already found to be an epithet of Shamash/Saturn?)

        "main_text": "THE HOUSE OF SHULMAN Further connections between Shalem/Shulman and Saturn can be derived from the el- Amara correspondence, letters written in Akkadian cuneiform dispatched to the Pharaoh Akhnaton and his father by the rulers of Palestine. In two of these letters which Egyptologists have numbered 74 and 290, reference is made to a place which transliterators have rendered differently. In 1915, J. Knudtzon settled on the reading of this place as Bet Ninib”—i.e., House of Ninib. Some time later, in 1940, Julius Lewy re-read the name of this place as Bit Shul- manu—House (or Sanctuary) of Shulman.” William Albright did not accept Lewy’s transliteration, claiming that the ideogram which he read as “Shulmanu” did not incorporate the determinative for divinity.” In 1969, the team of Tadmor and Kalai re-read the ideogram again, this time as Beth Nin- urta. Which, then, was the correct reading? This problem has given birth to many a debate,” but it should never have done so. Let me say that Knudtzon was perfectly correct in reading the name as Bet Ninib since the cuneiform ideogram which “spells” the name of the god in question is “NIN.IB. Of that, there never was any doubt.\" As pointed out in an earlier chapter of this work, Ninib, sometimes rendered Ninip and/or Nirig, was the planetary god Saturn.® The reason behind Lewy’s re-reading of the name as Shulman may not appear clear to the uninitiated. Suffice it to say that cuneiform characters can be read ideographically and/or phonetically. Thus the ideogram “NIN.IB can also be read “Ninurta®—which means that",

        "main_text": "Tadmor and Kalai’s reading of the place in question as Beth Ninurta was also correct. As we have already documented, Ninurta was also one of the names by which the planet Saturn was known. Lewy’s re-reading, meanwhile, was based on an equation which is to be found in an Assyrian explanatory list of divine names. In this list, the Assyrians themselves equated ¢NIN.IB with “DI.MES. Just as ‘NIN.IB can be read as ‘Ninurta, so also can “DI.MES be read as “Shulmanu.® It therefore follows that, like Ninib/Ninurta, with whom he was equated, Shulman was simply an alias of the planetary god Saturn. From this it can be seen that all three readings—Bet Ninib, Beth Ninurta, and Bit Shul- manu—are correct. They all mean the same thing: “House (or Sanctuary) of Saturn.” On the other hand, Albright was entirely wrong when he claimed that the name Shulman did not incorporate the determinative for divinity. The name Shulman, as it appears in el- Amarna letter 290, does incorporate the determinative —dingir—for divinity. Lewy repro- duced it by the usual transliteration— viz., “Sulmani.”™ The equation of Shulman with Ninurta/Saturn, as revealed in the above, is of additional importance to the subject of this chapter because, very much like Shulman/Shalem, Ninurta was also considered an immobile god. Thus, in Akkadian, Ninurta was styled kaimanu, that is “the steady star.”” (For those in the know: The association of Shulman with Resheph, like that of Ninurta with Nergal, will be discussed in a future work.) THE MESOPOTAMIAN EVIDENCE While we have already seen that one of the Assyro-Babylonian names for the planet Sat- urn was (Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-US, we have so far refrained from saying what the name stood for. Simply put, Lu-Bat Sag-U§ means “the steady planet.” The term “steady planet” is not much different than the term “stable planet,” so that we can see that this characteristic of the Saturnian deity was by no means a rarity. In keeping with this topic, we also find that Shamash/Saturn was said to have occupied “the house of rest.”® Here there is no intimation of slow movement. A deity who occupies a house of rest must himself be at rest. When speaking of the Sumerian god Ea, Berossus, writing in Greek, used the name Kro- nos” who was Saturn. And did we not, in Chapter 6, see Ea identified precisely as that very same planet? The Babylonian name of Ea was Enki.” In fact, Ea was actually written with the ideo- gram EN.KI. Our interest here lies in the fact that Enki, who must, therefore, also be equated with Saturn, was known as “the motionless lord” and god of “stability.”” As the god of sta- bility, Enki compares favorably with Saturn’s epithet as the Stable One.
