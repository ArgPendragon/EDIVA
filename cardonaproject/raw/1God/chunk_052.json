We see it at the midocean ridges, and there are some hot springs. But this is an almost unique opportunity to study a com- plex ecosystem in a readily available site—where there’s no light coming in and yet we have a complex menagerie of organisms.””® Actually, the propensity of varied organisms that live entombed within Earth’s cav- ers has been known and studied for far longer than Hose inadvertently intimates. Blind cave fish have been known since 1938;7’ cave-dwelling salamanders since 1689.” Not only do such creatures live in total darkness, light itself becomes a hazard—as proven by eye-less millipedes which curl up in frantic efforts to avoid artificially introduced beams of light.” As Donald Jackson could already write in 1982: “Beneath the shroud of eternal darkness [that exists ‘deep within the under- world’], no green plants—the basis of the food chain for most creatures—can grow. The environment could hardly seem less hospitable to life. And yet, astonishingly, animals can thrive in the caverns of the earth. Unseen, unheard, they creep and crawl, slither and scuttle, swim and fly, endlessly questing for the means of survival. In their marvelous physical adaptations, in the senses they use to navigate the perpetual night of a rockbound realm, in their extraor- dinary behavior and reproductive patterns, they offer a microscopic study of evolution.” None of these creatures of darkness are mammals, the class of animals to which man belongs. But consider the bat, many species of which spend their daylight hours hanging to- gether upside down in the recesses of darkened caves. When they venture outside, it is at night—from total darkness to a lesser gloom. Their sonic ability allows them to navigate the caliginous corridors, often sinuous, as well as they do outside at night. Had they been blind, they would have been able to maneuver just as well. For all they require, the world outside could just as well be totally dark. They would survive. Without relying on their sonic abilities, which they do not possess, various mammals, as well as some birds, have adapted so well to thriving at night that we now class them as",

Not only do such creatures thrive at night, they have become better suited to it. But man? Man, too, is an adaptable animal, and there is no way anyone can tell whether he would have been able to adapt to an environment of total darkness. But this, after all, is merely academic, since it has not been proposed, let alone claimed, that the Saturnian age of darkness was one of totality. All that the above implies is that sunshine is not, and never has been, a prerequisite for life. At present, man survives in an environment bathed in sunshine. But sunshine, in the end, is only starlight. And the brown dwarf star that once was Saturn would have bathed man in a similar, even if dimmer, light. Unlike the blind creatures of dark caves and abysmal depths, man cannot survive on a diet of sulfur or metallic ingredients. Besides, as we have seen, some of the oceanic denizens we have just scrutinized depend on a rain of organic particles falling from above. Man had no such manna to nourish him. It is doubtful that, at this early stage of his career as a human he could have sustained himself solely on the flesh of other animals. And, in any 290",

The problem then becomes one of photosynthesis PHOTOSYNTHESIS The intricacies of the photosynthetic conversion is too complex to be reviewed in any detail here. Suffice it to say that photosynthesis is the process by which plants harness the energy of sunlight which is absorbed by the chlorophyll contained in their make-up. It has often been stated that, directly or indirectly, the entire organic food-chain required to sustain all plants and animals depends on the photosynthetic process. As we have already seen above, this does not hold for sulfur-ingesting bacterial organisms or those that survive by di- gesting metallic constituents. It does, however, seem to hold for all forms of higher life. Because the primitive Earth—Saturn or no Saturn—would necessarily have been en- tirely different from the way it is at present, biologists had come to the conclusion that the photosynthetic process, whose sole support is chlorophyll, could not itself have been prime- val. They therefore theorized that life must have originated through the aid of some unknown 291",

As is well known, certain plants can grow in extreme environments, as in the Arctic regions, while others have adapted themselves to grow only in the tropics. And yet, the chemistry of photosynthesis is identical in all these plants. What actually transpires is that photosynthesis proceeds at a rate that is directly proportional to the incident radiation in which the light energy is utilized with the greatest efficiency. Moreover, it has been calcu- lated that only about one to three percent of the light falling on any plant is actually trans- formed into chemical energy. Most of the Sun’s radiation falling on a plant is lost through reflection and ineffective absorption by pigments other than chlorophyll (or, at least, other than those pigments in the chloroplasts). How does all this affect our progressing theoretical construct? Well, for one thing, Sunlight being starlight, photosynthesis would have been able to occur just as well under the light shed by the brown dwarf star that once was Saturn. Its dimmer light would have been compensated for by the plants’ ability to control absorption in proportion to the incident radiation falling upon them. Equally significant to our study is the fact that red light is the most important spec- trum necessary for the growing of plants.”' Brown dwarf stars are known to radiate a propen- sity of red light. Thus, the spectrum of received light on Earth during the Saturnian period would have been much redder than at present and, therefore, more conducive to plant growth. The brown dwarf star that was Saturn would have also radiated ultraviolet light.” But then so does the Sun. Ultraviolet rays are normally considered relatively harmless and even beneficial. Long-term exposure to high concentrations of these rays can, however, also prove harmful. We have no way of knowing how highly concentrated the ultraviolet rays from Sat- urn would have been. Since, even at its best, the Saturnian sun was feebler than the Sun, it is quite possible that its ultraviolet radiation would also have been feebler. During the age of semi-darkness with which we are presently concerned, when Saturn had not yet flared up as a true sun, its entire radiation might have been feebler still. In the meantime, it has been found that mosses in the Antarctic region are able to produce certain compounds which act to pro- tect them against excessive ultraviolet radiation.* Who is to say that other plants might not have derived the same ability during the Saturnian era of semi-darkness had our brown dwarf primary radiated excessive ultraviolet rays? THE REQUIRED TEMPERATURE Light and photosynthesis, however, are not the only requirements for the subsistence of plants and animals. Life also requires heat, at least warmth—or so we used to think.

In 1989, Michael Tennesen could report that: “In the 1960s the interior of Antarctica was declared a lifeless zone. But sci- entists have since discovered a rich array of organisms tucked away in isolated habitats. Robert Wharton, a biologist at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, has found life at the bottom of perpetually frozen lakes in an area of wind- swept, snowless valleys.”*° Lake Hoare, situated in a mountainous region 800 miles from the South Pole, is cov- ered by a 20-foot thick sheet of ice, the mean surface temperature of which reaches 4 below zero. And yet, colorful algae-like organisms manage to survive underneath the lake’s icy crust. As Wharton himself declared: “[These algae-like organisms are] a fairly advanced form of life. You’ve got a cell wall, and you’ve got DNA inside the cell that is able to reproduce and pass on information to its offspring. It’s not elephants, but it’s a big step in the evolution of biology.”*° Or, as Chris McKay succinctly phrased it, even in permanent subfreezing conditions, “life can persist much longer than we’d thought.””” True, as Wharton admitted, these algae-like organisms are not elephants—and a far cry from land plants and animals, to say nothing about humans. But, as in the case of those creatures that are able to exist in total darkness, the above serves to illustrate that generalities can often be deceiving. An adaptation to cold is not called for in the primeval Saturnian environment we are attempting to reconstruct. As we have already seen in Chapter 5, even at present, Saturn radi- ates more heat than it receives from the Sun. We saw there that, while Jupiter’s excessive heat is accepted as a residue from the planet’s formative period, most of Saturn’s had been relegated to kinetic energy released by the circulation of dissolved helium. But when Voy- ager 1 flew past Saturn in late 1980, it failed to uncover such evidence. As reported by Dennis Overbye: “Pioneer 11 had found that Saturn radiates almost three times as much energy as it receives from the sun. Some scientists had suggested that the helium might be settling deeper inside Saturn’s atmosphere than the hydrogen, re- leasing gravitational energy in the form of ‘helium rain.’ But this would leave Saturn’s outer layers relatively deficient in helium, and Voyager found that this was not the case.”**",

        "main_text": "Thus, the “source of the heat bubbling up through Saturn’s clouds” remained “a mystery that Voyager could not solve.” Meanwhile, the atmospheric scientist James Lovelock has made a name for himself with his theory of Gaia in which Earth is treated as a living organism. While this work has nothing to say for or against this proposition, some of Lovelock’s insights are germane to our subject. “For example, [according to orthodoxy] we know that when the solar system was formed the sun was dim and that it has heated up ever since. Yet Earth wasn’t too cold for life in the beginning, and it isn’t too hot for life now.”” While Lovelock gives his own reasons for this, the belief that the Sun was much weaker in Earth’s dim past has now gained acceptance. In analyzing the problems of climate thought to be inherent during the Archaean era—3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago—Gregory Jen- kins speaks of an environment that “was very warm with a sun that is much cooler than to- day’s.”*' Geological evidence indicates that this trend continued into the early Precambrian period during which “Earth was much warmer...than it is today, despite a weaker sun.”” Billions and millions of years are far removed from the Saturnian era with which we are concerned. The point I wish to stress, however, is that even as per orthodox belief, life on Earth does not seem to have required abundant heat from the Sun. We notice, for instance, that the reconstructions of primeval plants by paleobotanists, who are guided in their recon- structions by fossils found in coal and other deposits, end up showing some rather tall speci- mens exhibiting sparse crowns of foliage. Such a study, for instance, was recently conducted on specimens recovered from the coal seams of the American Midwest and Ohio Valley, which are believed to have been laid down by vast swamps which once stretched from Mis- souri to Pennsylvania. The lycopods, forty-five to ninety feet tall,” that were reconstructed from these remains have all the appearance of trees which seem to be straining their trunks in order to reach a feeble light, just as some plants do when grown in a dimly-lit terrarium that is kept in a darkened room.” Thus, for instance, when the succulent popularly known as hens-and-chickens, which usually grows relatively flat to the ground, is grown in such a ter- rarium, it tends to stretch tall and spindly with its fleshy leaves growing in an open and loose spiral until it either reaches the light or bends and breaks under its own weight.” As paleobotanists from the University of Illinois who studied the remains of lycopods ascertained: “Plant life was quite different then; most plants had no seeds, and flowers had not yet made their appearance.” True, these trees are supposed to have thrived three",

(Photosynthesis manifested itself in blue-green al- gae at the end of the pre-Cambrian era some 200 million years ago” —although this figure varies from one authority to another.) The reconstruction of such trees, as also earlier and more primitive ones, together with vistas of the environmental terrain that sustained them, had been going on much earlier than the Illinois University experiment. Dated to the late Silurian and all through the Devo- nian periods (c. 325-280 million years ago), the first land-based plants all exhibited the same spindly character with sparse verdant crowns which, like the lycopod trees, give the impres- sion that they all had to struggle for whatever available dim light there was to nourish them. And while plant life continued to evolve and spread from the Paleozoic to the Mesozoic eras, from the Devonian through the Jurassic and end of the Cretaceous periods, they were still spindly specimens struggling to reach the light.* It was not until the age of mammals, pre- dominantly during the Paleocene period, that the land became engulfed in a verdant profu- sion of subtropical plants. None of this is to say that the plants of the Quaternary era, which saw the advent of man, and which is, therefore, the era with which we are concerned, were anything like those of the pre-Cambrian down to the Cretaceous. But several things need to be pointed out here, not the least of which being the fact that photosynthesis works just as well under conditions other than those existing in the present world. (Of photoperiodicity we will speak in a following chapter.) Moreover, and what is more important to our study, is that if life could have originated under a dim cold Sun, to say nothing of the constant volcanic outpourings which are believed to have clouded the sky through most of Earth’s primeval eras, it could certainly have originated and thrived under a dim, but warmer, brown dwarf star. Which brings me to ask: Has it ever occurred to anyone that the sun which bathed Earth with its radiance during its past geologic eras might not have been our present one? THE PLASMASPHERE The problem we now face is this: With Saturn stationed above Earth’s north celestial pole, and the Sun still somehow absent, how could the world have received uniform radia- tion? How could Earth’s southern hemisphere been bathed in light and heat when it would have been entirely shielded from the north-radiating brown dwarf star that was Saturn? These are questions that have intrigued various other researchers. Prime among them, back in 1980, was Roger Ashton. What he finally settled upon was a shell of gas and dust, or bubble, within the hollow of which the Saturn-Earth system would have abided. The interior surface of this shell, according to Ashton, would have reflected back Saturn’s radiation to-",

What Ashton did not know was that, for different reasons, Ralph Juergens had already proposed such a plasma sheath four years earlier. “Presumably,” Juergens had written, “both [Saturn and Earth] would be enveloped in a common magnetosphere which... would equate with a sheath between the solar-wind plasma and any material body, or closely coupled sys- tems of bodies, at non-plasma potential.” At this point, some of my lay readers may want to know: What is a plasma? Common examples of plasma are what is created in neon tubes and in the brilliant arc of an arc-welder. At its simplest, to quote Wallace Thornhill, it “is an ionized gas in which the atoms or molecules have been stripped of their electrons, allowing both positive and negative charges to move independently.” There are those who deny that plasma is itself a gas, call- ing it instead a fourth state of matter which often behaves like a gas, but which conducts electricity and is affected by magnetic fields. There was a time, not so long ago, when astrophysicists had close to no use for electric- ity, let alone plasmas, in astronomy. But by 1999, Dennis Gallagher, a plasma physicist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, could claim that “99.9 percent of the Universe is made up of plasma.”™ All of a sudden, astronomers started talking about near-Earth plasma environment, plasmaspheres, plasma convections, and their associated Birkeland currents.” Plasma, however, is one thing; a plasma sheath or bubble is another. And yet, according to Thornhill, one characteristic of plasmas is that they tend to shield bodies embedded in them by creating what is known as a Langmuir sheath around them.* By 1997, even Talbott had jumped on this band-wagon, opting for a more extensive and encasing atmospheric shroud around the Saturnian system we have been reconstructing. As he explained: “There are many indications that the [Saturnian] planetary configuration ini- tially moved through a gas cloud or envelope preventing any sharp contrast of light and",
