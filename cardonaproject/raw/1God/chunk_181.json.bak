        "main_text": "But can an electric discharge be sustained? Apparently so. Thus, for instance, in 1991, Andrew Gray discovered a bright strand, 150 light years long and a couple wide, near the centre of the Milky Way. Dubbed “the Snake,” it is similar to other so-called “threads” which have been discovered within the barrel-shaped region of space known as the Galactic Centre Lobe. Gray himself is of the opinion that the Snake “is an electrical discharge, like a vast lightning bolt—so vast that it just hangs in space, instead of disappearing as earthly lightning does.”20 Meanwhile, the “corkscrew motion” of the jet, as mentioned above, originates from the plasma’s discharge system. As Thornhill succinctly explained: “...plasma is highly structured, allowing electric currents to flow through it along magnetic field lines in the form of filaments, themselves twisted into ropes. Such twisted filaments are seen in the powerful jets issuing from the cores of active galax- ies, the tornadic clouds in the Lagoon nebula, the giant prominences streaming from the sun, comet tails, etc.”2! Moreover, these twisted filaments are not static, but highly active vortices,?? thus ac- counting for the whirlwind motion endemic in the mythological axis mundi, But then, harking back to astral jets, is it known that these rotate? They surely do. Thus, for in- stance, data received from the Ulysses spacecraft showed that the twisting field lines connected to both poles of the Sun rotate with it. As Thornhill stated: “Astral jets are a more active and visible manifestation of the same Birkeland currents.”?3 This, of course, had already been ascertained by others, including Eric Lerner, who described such a jet as “a plasma-pinching vortex filament.”4 As he explained: “The vortices are produced by a phenomenon known as the pinch effect. A straight thread of electric current flowing through a plasma surrounds itself with a cylindrical magnetic field. This field attracts other currents flowing in the same direction. Thus the tiny current threads tend to ‘pinch’ together, drawing the plasma with them. The converging threads are twined into a plasma rope, much as water converging toward a drain generates a swirling vortex.” 25 As indicated by the diagram on the previous page, a Birkeland current has the appearance of two serpents twisted about each other. And was not Boreas originally said to have possessed serpent tails for feet? (Even so, it should be noted that the serpentine structure of the axis mundi was not always visibly apparent, concerning which much more will be di- vulged in a future volume.)?6 Taking his cue from Thornhill, Talbott, too, latched on to the polar jet theory. Thus, in an interview conducted by AEON, he spoke of the “galactic scale plasma model” which carried",

Here it is more than evident that, while willing to accept cosmic plasma jets as scaled-up versions of proto-Saturn’s boreal column, Talbott was not ready to relinquish his original idea, and thus sought to amalgamate the two. Thornhill himself was not exactly hostile to this unification. Thus, when questioned about Talbott’s interpretation of the polar column as a stream of fiery debris ejected toward Earth, he replied with these words: “T think that for most of the time [the polar column] would have been like a spec- tacular auroral effect with very little matter transfer taking place. It is only when it transformed suddenly from a glow discharge to an arc that substantial matter would have been transferred between bodies.”?? But can a Birkeland current transfer matter between bodies? Apparently so. As Thornhill explained: “To begin with, a rotating Birkeland current will form a tornado in an atmos- phere...Secondly, Eric Crew back in the 80s discussed how lightning usually acceler- ates positive ions vertically, creating a jet of hot moist air at the top of the discharge channel. In general terms the discharge compresses, heats and accelerates gases from a region of high pressure to a region of lower pressure. So bulk matter is moved by an electric discharge..”3° The tornadic quality of this sustained Birkeland current thus compensates for the loss of Jueneman’s Rankine vortex model. Or does it have to? After all, with the tidal heaping of the terrestrial atmosphere due to proto-Saturn’s proximity combined with its inevitable spiraling motion, the effects proposed by Jueneman should have taken place. Even the twisting of the axis can be accounted for through the workings of a Rankine vortex. Just as terrestrial tornadoes “occasionally exhibit smaller counter-rotating vortices in close proximity to the primary whirlwind,” so “on a much vaster scale, similar counter-rotating catenulate bolus flows would have snaked around the polar column in filamentary fashion.”3! Could it not, therefore, have been that both causes, a planetary Rankine vortex and a sustained Birkeland current, have joined forces in producing the most colossal tornado Earth has ever experienced? Or would the electrical force inherent in a Birkeland current have overpowered the Rankine effect?",
