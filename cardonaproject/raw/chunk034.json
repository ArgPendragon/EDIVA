                "content": "Chapter 16\nThe Interloping System\nOUT IN SPACE\nne question that still needs to be answered is: What hid the Sun, the Moon, and the\nstars from view? One could conjecture that the stars might have been rendered\ninvisible by the radiance, no matter how dim, emanating from the Saturnian sun. But,\nwhile true, we do not need to rely solely on that. If, as hypothesized, the Saturnian plasma-\nsphere was really opaque, it would have been enough to shield the stars from view. The\nMoon, | simply claim, was not yet in orbit around Earth.! As for the Sun, there is no way that\nSaturn’s dim light could have blotted out its radiance. The question then revolves on the\nclaimed opacity of the plasmasphere. Was the plasmasphere opaque enough to blot out the\nSun’s illumination?\nUnfortunately, as of this writing, not enough is known about planetary plasmaspheres to\nreadily answer that question. As the plasma physicist Anthony Peratt informed me, “this is\nnot a back of the envelope calculation,” which would probably “give you the wrong answer\nanyway.” What is required is a “full magnetohydrodynamic simulation with radiation trans-\nport,” which would take “several weeks once the problem was set up.” Despite all that, Peratt\nwas kind enough to supply me with a “top-of-the-head-opinion.” While the scientific verdict\nis not yet in, Peratt’s scholarly intuition is that “it would be extremely difficult for a planetary\nplasmasphere to become opaque enough to entirely blot out the sun.”?\nThus, together with other evidence which I shall soon be supplying, the conclusion has\nbeen reached that, during the Saturnian age of darkness, the Sun was not merely hidden, that\nis obscured. Like the Moon, it was actually absent. Which raises the question: Where could it\nhave been?\nTo be sure, the Sun was always here. Only we were not.\nAs far fetched as it might at first appear, what I am about to propose is that the Saturnian\nsystem, including Earth and its inhabitants, was originally exterior to the Solar family of\nplanets and that, having spent long ages traveling alone in the darkness of space, it eventually\ninvaded the Sun’s domain to become a permanent member of the present planetary order. I\nrealize that, by now, I have taken the reader with me into water that reaches well above our\nheads. We had better then start swimming— but let us take it one stroke at a time.\nThe concept that Earth had originally been exterior to the Solar System can be traced to\nthe Cartesian naturalist Benoit de Maillet (1656-1738). Basing his belief on ancient tradi-\ntions, including the Book of Genesis, de Maillet reasoned that the primordial Earth had re-\nvolved around a sun that was much smaller than the present one up until the time of the Bib-\nlical Deluge. In his scheme, Earth then left its original sun and invaded the Solar System as a\n1 In order not to burden our unfolding scenario with events out of chronological sequence, the subject of Earth\nwithout the Moon is reserved for a future sequel to this work.\n2 A.

As he wrote in 1950:\n“The solar system is not a structure that has remained unchanged for billions of\nyears...Nor is there justification for the excuse that man cannot know or find out how\nthis system came into being because he was not there when it was arranged in its pre-\nsent pattern...The Earth has come in [near-]contact with other planets and com-\nets...Also, some dark star, like Jupiter or Saturn, may be in the path of the sun, and\nmay be attracted to the system and cause havoc in it.”4\nAs apostate as Velikovsky might have been, the idea of an interloper into the Solar Sys-\ntem is not exactly adverse to mainstream astronomy. Thus, for instance, in 1962, R. L. For-\nward expressed the opinion that Pluto was an alien that had settled among the solar family.\n“Apparently Pluto is a stranger which arrived in its present orbit from the regions of\nspace...It is as if Pluto had come along, interacted with Neptune, and pushed it into\nan inner orbit.”>\nJohn Weir has even sought to account for the apparent deviations between the present\nmotions of Venus and those recorded in the Babylonian Ninsianna Tablets (also known as the\nTablets of Ammizaduqa) by postulating the capture of “a relatively large body” by the Solar\nSystem, which body “might have broken up and been ‘captured’ by Jupiter.”6\nThis is highly interesting because the invasion of such a body would have had to have\ntranspired during historical times as opposed to the millions of years into the past to which\nastronomers usually relegate such occurrences. It also proves that speculative events dictated\nby the contents of ancient historical documents are not outside the domain of conventional\nastronomers.\nDilettantes, including Biblical fundamentalists, have also involved themselves in similar\nhypothesizing. Donald Patten, with whom this writer disagrees on too many issues, is also of\nthe belief that Earth was once extraneous to the Sun’s domain. As he wrote in 1967:\n“Heliogenesis must be discarded in favor of Galactogenesis. Galactogenesis implies\nthat our planet Earth, and its satellite, the Moon, have both spent ample astronomical\ntime both beyond our solar system as well as within it. Hence...a catastrophic time\ntable must include both pre-solar time (galactic time) and intra-solar time (time spent\nwithin the Sun’s domain).”7\n3 B. de Maillet, Telliamed (Amsterdam, 1748), pp. 169-173, as cited by S.

                "content": "But then, returning to the topic with Samuel Windsor in 1988, the original proposal was\nexpanded to cover more than just Earth and the Moon. According to these two writers, the\nentire planets of the present solar family had once belonged to an extraneous system gov-\nemed by a dark star, the binary partner of the Sun, which they referred to as Planet X.8 In this\nscenario, the Planet X system would, from time to time, have approached closer to the Sun\nwhere, with each close approach, the latter slowly stripped Planet X of its brood of planets, a\nfew at a time.\nPatten and Windsor did not have the mytho-historical record in mind when they con-\nstructed their scenario. Theirs was actually an attempt to disprove the nebular hypothesis\nusually attributed to Immanuel Kant and supplant it with what Patten and Windsor believed\nto be a more viable history of the formation of the Solar System.° They did not even seem to\nrealize that Kant’s nebular hypothesis had already been discarded at the time they proposed\ntheir theory. Thus, their various objections to Kant’s nebular hypothesis are entirely\nsuperfluous. Besides, it did not even dawn on them that their version of the formation of the\nSolar System begged the question of how the Planet X system itself originated. On that score,\nif on no other, their scenario is as redundant as their objections.\nWorst of all, the detailed step by step description of the manner in which this planetary\ntransfer too place, with precise orbital and rotational periods, values of eccentricity, closeness\nof approach, etcetera and so forth, both before and after capture, often given to many places\nof decimal, makes one think that the authors had actually been there at the time with a load of\nscientific instruments to record it all for posterity.!° Theirs is not a methodology that inspires\nconfidence, let alone credence.\nActually, it was Ralph Juergens who set us on the right path. Back in 1977, basing his\nscenario on what little Velikovsky had yet published about the subject of Saturn, he was\nbold enough to climb out on what was then still considered something of a slim limb. As\nhe wrote:\n“,..some points of...discussion may emerge from a consideration of Velikovsky’s as\nyet unpublished evidence that Saturn was once a star and in all likelihood the Earth’s\n‘Sun’ at one time...\n“Velikovsky has stated that Satum was disrupted in a near-collision with Jupiter.\nKnowing little or nothing of the details, I can most easily imagine such an encounter\nin terms of a Saturnian planetary system, which included the Earth, being invaded,\ndismembered, and captured by an interloping system of relative giants consisting es-\nsentially of the present Sun and Jupiter... 1!\nOut in space, this would be the same as having the Saturnian system invading the Solar\none, as per our present supposition. On the other hand, in this work, I have nothing to offer\nconcerning the disruption of Saturn through a collision with Jupiter. Nevertheless, the\nhypothesis that Saturn and Earth had once constituted a planetary system that was exterior to\nours fits our unfolding scenario to the proverbial Tee.\n8 D. Patten & S.

                "content": "Following Juergens, Frederick Hall disclosed similar ideas of his own:\n“Most stars are paired in binary systems. A few are trinities or orbit each other in\ngroups of four or more. Still fewer go it alone. The Sun appears to be a loner. In re-\ncent years it has been postulated that the Sun, after all, may have its partner too,\nwhich would necessarily be a very small star, not seen as yet by astronomers. Neme-\nsis [as this solar companion has been dubbed] is posited to be in an extremely ellipti-\ncal orbit, approaching the Sun every 26 million years...\n“A stronger likelihood, perhaps, is that Nemesis does not exist and will not be found.\nNemesis would now be near its aphelion and, over an incredibly long moment arm,\nshould exert a detectable tug on the Sun. No news is no news. But another possibility\nis also worth considering. If in the past there was a Nemesis and it is no longer out\nthere, it may actually be here. Two stars in a binary system each may have a quota of\nterrestrial bodies and gas giant planets. If their orbital relationship is highly elliptical,\nboth systems could suffer drastic changes at each close approach. The much smaller\nstar would be subject to close encounters with gas giant satellites of the much larger\nstar, involving a possible loss of considerable angular momentum and mass. Hence, it\nis possible that a former Nemesis is now part of our Solar System.\n“In the event of such a catastrophic event such a ‘star’ could also lose its ability to\ngenerate stellar amounts of heat and light and could be captured as a close-in gas gi-\nant satellite of the larger star...If it is ultimately decided that Earth did arrive into the\nSolar System as a satellite of a Nemesis-like sun/planet—perhaps Jupiter or Sat-\nurn—then numerous geological mysteries would be cleared up and man’s early pre-\noccupation with planetary worship would be much easier to understand.” !2\nEven more recently, the invasion of the Solar system by the Saturnian one, including\nEarth, has been taken up and expounded further by Wallace Thornhill. 3\nAstronomers have not yet postulated that Earth may have originated outside our Sun’s\ndomain. But, in view of their recently revised history of the Solar Systems, as will be\noutlined below, even they are now asking whether Earth has always been where it is now.14\nSo where could it have been?\nEXTRA-SOLAR PLANETS\nWhen, in the 1980s, Carl Sagan aired his belief, earlier adhered to by Giordano Bruno,\nthat the universe is filled with planets orbiting stars other than our own Sun, he was laughed\nout of court.

                "content": "Maybe not in a different galaxy but, as early as 1967, Axel Firsoff had already been\nwriting about the discovery of extra-solar planets as if they were in the realm of general\nknowledge. Thus, in explaining what he termed “the general plan of planetary systems,” he\nalready could refer to “super [JJovian planets, which are known to accompany some stars.” '\nDespite more recent reports to the contrary, the first of these extra-solar planets was dis-\ncovered by D. Reuyl in 1936. With an estimated mass of 0.04 M, and an orbital period of 15\nyears, it was detected near the star known as Ross 614.17\nAnother planet already known to Firsoff is one “a little less than twice as massive as Ju-\npiter,” which orbits Proxima Centauri, 4.3 light years away. '8\nThese planets, it should be pointed out, are detected rather than observed. Stars which are\naccompanied by planets go through periodic wobbles which are ascertained through the\nDoppler shifts in their spectral lines, due to the attraction of their invisible attendants. The\namount of wobble allows the accompanying planet’s mass and orbit to be calculated.\nAs Firsoff reported:\n“Several other stars are known to have dark companions, but these are rather more\nmassive than Proxima’s big planet. Such superplanets may be partly degenerate, with\ninteriors in superdense conditions encountered in White Dwarfs, and so could be\nquite small, despite their great masses.”!9\nAnother body, which Firsoff referred to as “a dark companion of about 10 times the mass\nof Jupiter,” was also detected orbiting the red dwarf star Lalande 21185, which is calculated\nto be 8.1 (or 8.25 as newer sources have it) light years away and said to have a mass of 0.4\nM. As Firsoff adds: “This discovery was due to the exceptionally large proper motion of the\nstar, which changes its position in the sky by 4.8\" a year and, for this reason, was being\nclosely followed.” 2°\nFirsoff did not enumerate the discoveries and identities of the extra-solar planets known\nin 1967 one by one, but he did state that “nearly 10 superplanets are now known to be at-\ntached to the nearest stars.”2! Thus, even then, Firsoff could claim that:\n“Far from being exceptional, the Solar System is rather a humdrum example of\nplanetary configurations. There are multiple stars, each with an array of planets of its\nown; close binaries sharing one or more planets; superplanets that may have planetary\nsatellites, which may in turn be accompanied by moons.”22\nAstronomers are not always honest. Take, for instance, the planet supposedly discovered\nby Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz in orbit around the star 51 Pegasi at a distance of 50\nlight years.

                "content": "of the surprise this caused when first announced in 1995. What, then, of the 10 extra-solar\nplanets that were already known by 1967, the first of which was discovered in 1936?\nSo, similarly, with the planet—or, at least, a brown dwarf star—said to orbit Proxima\nCentauri, which has recently been said to have first been discovered in 1998 through the\nHubble Space Telescope.24 How, then, could Firsoff have written about it in 1967?\nBut then, David Golimowski and Dan Schroeder nixed the whole thing. More sensitive\nobservations led these two observers to conclude that no evidence really existed for such “a\nbrown dwarf or planet companion.” As Golimowski stated:\n“We have images of Proxima that definitely should have revealed something. They\ndid not.”25\nEven so, as of this writing, planets in extra-solar systems are being detected almost every\nmonth. These assemblages, however, bear little resemblance to our own Solar System. Cal-\nculated to be half the mass of Jupiter, the 51 Pegasi planet orbits its primary at a mere dis-\ntance of 5 million miles, which is seven times closer than tiny Mercury orbits our Sun. The\nplanet completes its orbit in a mere 4.2 days.26\n“To appreciate how bizarre this behavior is,” writes Flamsteed, “it helps to consider\nthe bigger planets in our solar system—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They\nare all at least a hundred times farther from the sun than 51 Peg[asi]’s planet appears\nto be. And it takes them years—a full dozen years, in the case of Jupiter—to make a\nsingle orbit.”27\nWhat, then, of the belief that giant gas planets can only form somewhere in the middle of\nthe revolving cloud of collapsing interstellar gas and dust that goes into forming a solar sys-\ntem? By the 1990s, astronomers had to ask: “How could a giant planet form so close to a star\nwithout being sucked in by gravity?”8\nActually Doug Lin had already suggested that planets like Jupiter could migrate from an\nouter system in toward their parent star. Lin’s hypothesis, however, did not envisage such\ngiant planets ever coming to a halt close to their primary. His theory demanded that such\nplanets would eventually be swallowed up by their sun. But, in view of newer discoveries,\nLin and fellow astronomers were soon writing in Nature with two different scenarios aimed\nat getting a Jupiter-sized planet to stop short of being swallowed up.”9\nAnd then—the see-saw of scientific opinion—David Gray announced that the posited\nplanet around 51 Pegasi was not really there at all.3° Most astronomers, however, have disre-\ngarded his conclusion, and the posited planet has now become fact.\nIn the twelve months following this discovery and its attempted debunking, six other ex-\ntra-solar planets were announced as having been detected. Three of them were said to be Ju-\npiter-sized bodies orbiting “absurdly close” to their primaries. Two others were found to orbit\n23 §, Flamsteed, “Impossible Planets,” Discover (September 1997), pp. 79-80.\nba Anonymous, “No Proxima Planet, Probably,” Astronomy (July 1998), p. 30.\nIbid.\n26 S, Flamsteed, loc. cit.\n27 Ibid., p. 80.\n2 Ibid., p. 81.\n29 Ibid.\n30 Jbid., p. 82."

As\nFred Rasio had to admit, “you get the impression that most solar systems are not like ours.”32\nAnother planet was discovered orbiting the star Tau Bootis, which is slightly larger and\nhotter than our Sun, at a distance of sixty light-years. This planet has been calculated to have\na mass equivalent to 3.87 that of Jupiter. It orbits its primary in a circular path in 3.3 days. It\nis 6.9 million kilometers (0.046 astronomical units) from its sun.*? This places it closer to its\nprimary than Earth is to our Sun.\nThe planet orbiting Lalande 21185, concerning which Firsoff had written in 1967, is even\ncloser to us—now calculated as 8.25 light-years away. It is now believed that this star is or-\nbited by at least two planets. One of these is said to be the size of Jupiter at a distance\nequivalent to Saturn’s distance from our Sun. The other planet, only slightly less massive\nthan Jupiter, is believed to orbit Lalande at about the distance of the asteroid belt.34\nThe binary star system CM Draconis, 50 light-years away, is also believed to be orbited\nby a planet with a diameter equal to 85 percent that of Jupiter. The stars themselves orbit\neach other around a common center of gravity once every day. The purported planet would\nthen orbit both stars in a circuit completed in “several months.” This is the first planet de-\ntected in orbit around “a tightly separated binary star.”35\nMeanwhile, Doppler shifts are not the only means by which extra-solar planets can be\ndetected. In 1996, through the use of the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers noticed that\nthe disk of dust around the star Beta Pictoris seemed to be tilted. They could only think of\ntwo possible ways in which this stellar disk could have been unbalanced: it was either due to\nradiation from the star itself or the existence of a large planet which would have tugged at the\ndebris in the disk. Two years later, Sally Heap, then of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Cen-\nter, trained Hubble’s Imaging Spectrograph on Beta Pictoris to obtain closer views of the star\nand its disk. Her verdict was that the images she was able to resolve strongly suggested a\nplanet or planets.3° She did, however, warn that: “Because the star is shrouded in dust, it will\nbe impossible to ever see any planets around Beta Pic., so I don’t know how we will get a\ndirect confirmation.”3”\nAnother extra-solar planet, calculated to be 6.84 times the mass of Jupiter, has been de-\ntected orbiting the star 70 Virginis at a mere distance of 0.47 astronomical units in an orbital\nperiod of 116.7 days.38 It was unmasked by the team of Geoffrey Marcy and Paul Butler,?\nwho have found “more planets than anyone else in history.”40 Six of these planets, brought to\nlight by 1998, were featured in Astronomy;*! five others were reported by early 1999, two of\nwhich have been calculated to be 5 times the mass of Jupiter.4?\nIn the year 2000 came news of the possible discovery of extra-solar planets which ap-\npeared to measure a mere 2.5 Earth radii.

                "content": "tected, like the one passing in front of the binary star system known as CM Draconis. Until\nthen, as we have seen, only Jupiter-sized, and larger, planets had been located.\nWilliam Cochran and his collaborators from the University of Texas announced a planet\n“that closely resembles Jupiter” around Epsilon Eridani, which is the closest star that is\nsimilar to our own Sun. Orbiting at 300 million miles from the star, it takes close to seven\nyears to complete one circuit.4\nOther extra-solar planets imbedded within the disks surrounding youthful stars, detected\nthrough means other than Doppler shifts, have been announced by Nick Gorkavyi at NASA’s\nGoddard Space Flight Center. Gorkavyi’s method involves a search for “whorls and clumps\nproduced by a planet’s gravitational meddling.” This method rewarded him with three new\nplanets, including one that is said to be only 0.2 times the mass of Jupiter, revolving around\nEpsilon Eridani, 5.5 billion miles away, which would make it about twice the distance our\nown Neptune orbits from the Sun.45\nAn even smaller planet, weighing in at about 0.15 Jupiter’s mass—which makes it about\nhalf Saturn’s mass—has been detected circling the star HD 83443. This one has a second\nSaturn-sized planet which, as Svitil reported, “bolsters the view that groupings like our solar\nsystem are not uncommon.”4\nIn January of 2001, the extra-solar planet-hunting team lead by Geoffrey Marcy an-\nnounced the detection of “a pair of planets, each about the mass of Jupiter, that whirl around\ntheir home star [Gliese 876], 15 light-years from Earth in perfect lock-step.” One of these\nplanets takes 30 days to complete its orbit, the other “exactly” twice as long—that is in a\ntwo-to-one ratio. 47\nAlso announced by Marcy and his team is a solar system, dominated by the star HD\n168443, at a distance of 123 light-years in the constellation Serpens. This system harbors a\n7.7 to 15 Jupiter-mass planet accompanied by another body that has been calculated to be\nfrom 17 to 40 times as massive as Jupiter. A body that massive had astronomers scratching\ntheir heads since they could not “quite figure what it can be.” As Marcy himself noted: “It’s\na bit frightening.”\n“What’s frightening,” reports Michael Lemonick, “is that these discoveries make it clear\nhow little astronomers know about planets...”49 Or, as Princeton astronomer Scott Tremaine\nput it: “Not a single prediction for what we’d find in other systems has turned out to be cor-\nrect.”50\nAs of this writing, the number of extra-solar planets that have been detected orbiting\nother stars had risen to 55.5! The problem caused by all these discoveries was succinctly\nstated by Flamsteed when he wrote that:\n“After decades of searching, we’ve finally found other planets orbiting other stars,\nand found them in abundance. Now the only problem is figuring out how on Earth to\nexplain them.” 52\n+8 L. R.
