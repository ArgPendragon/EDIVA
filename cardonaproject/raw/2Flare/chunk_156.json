        "content": "<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>MASS SLAUGHTER</center></b></p>\n<p>Large-scale massacres of mammoths in lieu of sporadic killings formed the accepted con- clusion by the 1960s.! By then, the blame for the extinction of the American mammoth was placed squarely on the shoulders of the Clovis people, forerunners of the Amerinds, named for their long, fluted spear points first discovered near Clovis in New Mexico as early as the 1930s.? These plainsmen had “one enormous advantage—the keen stone spear points that are the hallmark of their culture.” As noted by Robert Claiborne for Time-Life Books: “The seemingly delicate Clovis points are actually lethal tools, and the Clovis people make effective use of them in killing the great woolly mammoth. Archeologists have found ample evidence of the Clovis points’ deadliness embedded in the remains of the hunters’ mammoth prey...The points are generally called projectile points, but whether the tools or weapons of which they formed the cutting tip were in fact pro- jectiles is a matter of conjecture. Unquestioningly they are spear points of some sort (they are far too big for arrow heads and, besides, the bow and arrow was unknown to Clovis hunters), but there is no direct evidence to show whether the spears were used primarily for thrusting, as lances, or for throwing, as javelins. Unlikely as it seems, even the immense mammoths could have been taken by men on foot, armed only with lances. This is the way elephants were hunted in Africa until quite recently. Like the modern elephant hunters, the mammoth’s attackers may have worked in two groups, some acting to divert the animal’s attention while others dashed in to stab at its belly and legs from close quarters. “But many experts think Clovis man avoided such dangerously close encounters by throwing their weapons at their prey. To do so effectively they would have needed an extra tool, the simple but revolutionary spear thrower, or atlatl, which enables a man to hurl his weapon from a relatively safe distance, yet with enough force to penetrate the tough hide of a mammoth.”+ Whether the Clovis people possessed the spear thrower, however, remains speculative&gt; Even so, there are various clues which have suggested to archaeologists that the Clovis people “did indeed have ways of minimizing the risks of mammoth hunting.” Thus, for instance, virtually all theorized mammoth kill sites occur at locations where the nature of the ground is indicative of former ponds or streams. Hunters could have hidden in waiting until the mammoths came there to drink. In other cases the indication is that the hunters attacked animals that had bogged down in the marshy edges of a lake.

        "content": "<p>have not only been found in North America but also at Torralba, Spain, where the earlier Homo erectus seems to have used this technique.! “Since mammoths, if they were anything like modern elephants, must have been in- telligent beasts, they would not often have bogged down this way accidentally. It is fairly safe to assume that the hunters had worked out techniques of stampeding the animals into the treacherous lake margin. At other sites, mammoths seem to have been stampeded into a steep-sided stream gully, where they would presumably have been either injured or at least hampered in their movement. And at one place the bones uncovered are all from baby or half-grown mammoths, suggesting that the hunters had managed to cut out these less dangerous—and doubtless more tender— individuals from the herd. “Whatever Clovis man’s techniques, he killed mammoths with considerable fre- quency; at least the bones turn up fairly consistently with his distinctively fashioned spear points.” But that the above report seems somewhat exaggerated is evidenced by more recent considerations. As Canby reported in 1979: “Most conspicuous [around 11,000 years ago] are the Clovis mammoth hunters, whose trademark of kill sites and fluted points boldly punctuates western North America...The points concentrate along major river systems, a pattern paralleling that of hundreds of mammoth- and mastodon-skeleton discoveries. Yet except for [an undisputed] kill site on Washington’s Olympic Peninsula and another in Missouri, evidence does not link man with mastodon north of central Mexico. North American hunters seem to have shied away from the burly beasts.” In fact, many of the supposed mammoth kill sites are so controversial that, as Jared Dia- mond reported: “Many paleontologists don’t blame the spasm of extinction on Clovis hunters, because there’s no [or very little] surviving evidence of mass slaughter—only the fossilized bones of a few butchered carcasses here and there.”* And, as noted above, evidence of butchery is not necessarily proof of a kill. Besides, since the African elephant did not become extinct during a much longer span of time during which it was hunted by various tribes, why would the mammoth, to say nothing of the mastodon, have succumbed to man in a much shorter duration? The case, of course, is entirely different when it comes to other animals which ancient man did slaughter en masse. Ice Age man may have derived the idea from hunting ibex in the</p>",

In trying to escape, the ibex would have easily leaped across gaps, but, sometimes, some would miscalculate and fall to their deaths in the crags below. This might have led to the Cro-Magnons inducing ibex to leap across such gaps and, eventually, even into driving herds of ibex over the edge of a cliff. The discovery of a multitude of shat- tered ibex bones at the bottoms of narrow gorges supplies good evidence in favor of this hunting method.! In time the above routine was also used in hunting wild horses.? Driving the horses up a slope to a cliff, Cro-Magnon man would have kept them in line with bonfires lit along a nar- row corridor and perhaps with flaming torches in their hands. Urging them ever forward in a wild stampede, the terrified animals, unable to stop because of the press from behind, would have been left with no recourse but to leap to their death over the edge.3 “Of these [Cro-Magnon] communities, one of the most interesting was a huge out- door hunting station near Solutré in France where the bones of an estimated 100,000 horses were found, along with those of other animals. Scientific study of this vast boneyard suggests that disciplined companies of Cro-Magnon hunters convened in the area, summer after summer, for organized ‘drives’ on wild horses...”4 Tbex and horses were not the only herd animals that were slaughtered en masse by ancient man at the close of the Ice Age. In North America, bison suffered a similar fate. Here the Clovis people were followed by Folsom man, named after Folsom, New Mexico, near which his distinctive weapons, different from those of the Clovis, were first discovered. While Fol- som spear points were somewhat smaller in size, the flutings in which the shaft was embedded extended almost the full length of the blade giving the haft a better grip when lashed to the point. Folsom man, however, was soon replaced by a group who used entirely unfluted spear points. These became known to archaeologists as the Plano hunters. By this time—in fact by Folsom time—the North American mammoth, as well as its near cousin, the mastodon, had already become extinct. Claiborne phrased it eloquently when he stated that the mammoth’s place as preferred game “had been taken by the American animal that from [then] on would be the mainstay of the Plains Indians —the bison.”5 Or, as Jared Diamond put it: “There may be a simple explanation for why Folsom hunters switched from mammoths to bisons: there weren’t any mammoths left.”6 One of the techniques developed by Folsom man in hunting was “the stampeding of bison to their death over a cliff or the lip of a gully.”? Whether this procedure was introduced from Europe, where it had been used much earlier by the Cro-Magnons to slaughter vast herds of horses, or whether Folsom hunters developed the technique independently is not known.
