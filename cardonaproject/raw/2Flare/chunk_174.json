As if all that was not enough, our ancient ancestors found themselves in a totally different electrical environment. And this, too, had its effect on the human psyche. As is now common knowledge, the magnetic fields we have treated of in the past pages of this work are intricately entwined with the processes of life itself. “At the moment it is difficult to assess human sensitivity to weak magnetic fields, such as that of Earth [wrote Frederic Jueneman], but it is well-known that biological organ- isms reorient themselves in response to magnetic effects. Lower lifeforms, as bacteria and protozoa, show reduced reproductive activity in the absence of magnetism, and smaller mammals and birds also show strange behavior and fundamental changes in motor response when shielded from magnetic fields for some length of time.”! The late Earl Milton had even more to say about the subject. “I am impressed by what I have read,” he wrote. “In almost every field I encounter I find the imprint of electricity.” “The books tell me that when there is a surplus of negative ions in the atmosphere we humans feel better [he went on]. Other books tell me that a strong magnetic environ- ment superimposed on the weakly magnetic field of the Earth improves plant growth.”3 But also: “The fatality rate increases by about a factor of 3 when the Earth is disturbed magneti- cally. I live in a region of the world where the Chinook winds blow...When they blow, the atmospheric pressure varies rapidly and the electric field above the Earth’s surface fluctuates; people get migraine headaches. After about 3 days of continuous winds people start to fight over trivial things, psychological disturbances increase, murders and suicides become more likely. There is a lot of evidence that comparable environ- mental stress occurs in other places where electric or magnetic disturbances are com- mon.”4 The validity of the above concise commentary is evidenced by a research program called Project Migraine conducted by the biologist Christopher Dodge in 1980 which indicated that a sufferer of migraine headaches was uniquely sensitive to alterations in electromagnetic</p>",

And if this applied to one particular individual, it must surely apply to others. Other studies have since then indicated that psychiatric malfunctions tend to rise signifi- cantly with high levels of solar radioflux and sudden magnetic disturbances in the iono- sphere.? Can it be imagined what humanity might have suffered through these additional effects during and after the proto-Saturnian system’s entry into the Solar System which brought it into direct contact with the new electrical potential of our present Sun? Can one imagine what the braking of Earth’s rotation, with its accompanying atmospheric disturbances, would have wrought on mankind? But even this, coupled with Earth’s tectonic pangs, was not the greatest influential cause in the change that occurred in the human psyche due to proto-Saturn’s glorious, and relatively destructive, flare-up. What changed the most, and what altered the minds of our ancestors more than anything, was the transformation that transpired in the sky. After untold ages of sameness, during which Paleolithic man took the immobile sun suspended in Earth’s north celestial sphere and its attendant column of tapering light for granted, a revolutionary transformation ushered in a series of cosmic events, catastrophic in their own right, which continued to unfold for generations to come. What had been an inanimate fixture, now seemed imbued with life. And because man was intelligent enough to understand that Earth’s cataclysmic upheaval had been caused by this newly active entity, he sought to appease it in an effort to keep it from repeating its destructive actions. From that time on, man sought to emulate it, both in its assumed evil and benign aspects. Men tried to imitate what it did, even to the point of exterminating some of their own kind, in order to condone its actions in the belief that it would thus recognize them as its own kith and kin. In time, there appeared other bodies suspended between Earth and proto-Saturn and they, too, involved themselves in the cosmic drama that continued to unfold down through the ages. To ancient man, these newly visible bodies were all imbued with life, a life that was not only mysterious in its assumed disposition, but also extremely potent. The power that these bodies were seen to wield was far beyond anything man had known before. And while this power could be imitated, it could never be duplicated. Thus it was that these cosmic bodies developed into what eventually became known as gods—celestial entities that had no counterparts on Earth and yet with an incredible power over it. And as our ancestors saw fit to imitate the proto-Saturnian deity, so did they continue to emulate the deeds of these newly developed gods that were soon to dominate the celestial realm. As man was to remember in times to come: “Thus the gods did; thus men do.”3 The well-being of the human race became dependent on what evolved into a sacrosanct decree. As later pundits were to admit: “We must do what the gods did in the beginning.” It was in this manner that ritual, and eventually religion, took an obsessive hold on the human mind.</p>",

        "content": "<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>END OF ACT TWO</center></b></p>\n<p>We are now in a position to revamp the set of theses we reconstructed in the previous volume devoted to the study which we have continued to develop in the present work.! We must now expand, reshuffle, and renumber our register in order to accommodate a more co- herent chronological scheme that will include proto-Saturn’s flare-up and all that it entailed. Our refined set of hypotheses will now read as follows: Hypothesis #1: That the present giant gas planet we know by the name of Saturn had previously been a sub-brown dwarf star free floating in space outside the demarcation of the present Solar System. Hypothesis #2: That Earth was at that time a satellite of this proto-Saturnian sub-star which, because of its proximity, loomed large in the sky as a distinct disk larger than the pre- sent apparent size of the full Moon. Hypothesis #3: That, during this period, a nebulous entity, which we have conjectured to have been a circumstellar disk, surrounded the proto-Saturnian primary in its equatorial plane. This nebulous cloud seems to have been what our ancient forefathers alluded to as Chaos. Hypothesis #4: During this same period, the proto-Saturnian orb was described as having floated over an apparition which looked like a sheet of celestial water, a cosmic ocean. Whether this “water” was the same conjectured circumstellar disk, which would have given the appearance of a celestial whirlpool, an auroral manifestation, or a combination of both phenomena, is not now easily determined. Hypothesis #5: That this proto-Saturnian assemblage was at first the only visible celestial entity in Earth’s primordial sky. Hypothesis #6: That, as seen from Earth, the proto-Saturnian primary did not rise or set, but remained visibly immobile at all times. Hypothesis #7: That proto-Saturn’s immobility was due to the fact that Earth was sta- tioned directly “beneath” proto-Saturn’s south pole and that, from Earth, proto-Saturn ap- peared to be permanently fixed in the north celestial sphere, the very place which is now oc- cupied by the Pole Star. What this also means is that Earth and proto-Saturn were linearly aligned with both of them sharing the same axis of rotation. Hypothesis #8: That what appeared to be a slow-twirling narrow beam of tapering light connected the proto-Saturnian orb to Earth’s north polar region. This ray from above is inter- preted as a sustained plasma discharge in the form of Birkeland current, a scaled-down ver- sion, or the slowly deteriorating remnant, of a so-called plasma “jet” as presently observed streaming from galactic and stellar objects, and as in fact has been detected emanating from brown dwarf stars. Hypothesis #9: That Earth was originally engulfed in what our ancestors persistently re- ferred to as darkness. This was an age which, despite its remoteness in time, ended up etching itself indelibly in human consciousness. It was a time during which the Sun, the Moon, and the stars were not yet visible in the sky. Proto-Saturn ruled alone. And yet this</p>",
