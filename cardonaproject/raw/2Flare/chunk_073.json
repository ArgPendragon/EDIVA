But this theory is contradicted by the absence, during the ‘ice age’ of ice sheets in Siberia, which was actually populated, up to its northernmost regions, well inside the Arctic Sea, by one of the most impres- sive zoological communities of all times. Millions (more than 40 millions, according to F. C. Hibben) of mammoths roamed Siberia and Alaska, large animals the size of which can be found today only in tropical regions, or in those areas where the supply of fodder is guaranteed all the year round. Together with the mammoths, there were reindeers, rhinos, hippopotamus, bears, lions, leopards and Prjevalsky horses. There were also giant beavers and sloths, big horn deer, camels, [saber-toothed] tigers, buf- faloes, [auroch] bulls and many more: strong evidence that the climate in Siberia was much milder than today...”! The presence of man in this same area at the same time is also accounted for. Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon sites have been discovered strewn all over the place south of the Pleisto- cene glacial demarcation. None have yet come to light from those areas which were covered with glacial ice. The glaciated region seems to have formed a girdle, roughly between lati- tudes 60° and 40°, a massive belt stretching midway around the northern hemisphere. Both the areas above this belt, that is the Arctic, and below it, remained free of ice except for the peaks of some of the highest mountains. Cro-Magnon remains, it is true, have also been found in Alaska, but this region of Beringia remains controversial, with some claiming and others disclaiming that it had been glaciated at the time of the crossing from Siberia. There is, however, additional evidence from south eastern Alaska which speaks against those who are still of the belief that this portion of Beringia was under ice during the time in question. This comes from remains in a cave which “indicate that plants and animals were still living there.”?</p>",

Even so, these lands have not been entirely reluctant to disclose their se- crets. As we have already seen, bone tools have been discovered in the lowlands close to Bluefish Caves, suggesting that hunters stalked the Yukon as early as 40,000 years ago at the very peak of the last Ice Age.! Primitive stone tools, as well as the remains of a prehistoric camp, dated as early as 2300 B.C., have shown up on Ellesmere Island.” More tools, including an incised mammoth tusk, dated at older than 30,000 years, have been discovered in Russia’s Arctic regions.&gt; Stone tools, similar to those retrieved in East Africa, obviously worked by man, have been unearthed at various sites beneath the permafrost in present Siberia.4 Traces of Stone Age settlements, containing “bone implements and arrowheads, as well as needles and axes skillfully fashioned from mammoth tusks,” have also been found in the New Siberian Islands.5 Prehistoric petroglyphs depicting the “well preserved incised outlines of whales and deer” are still to be seen on the cliffs of Spitzbergen.° Ancient rock paintings have been discovered at river sites all the way from Scandinavia to Siberia. “The drawings show changes of style and subject over the centuries that suggest a pattern of evolution in the preoccupations and way of life of early man,” A. P. Okladnikov reported in 1969. “Furthermore, they indicate that there was communication or commonalty of some kind among the nomadic northern tribes over the wide region from the Baltic to the Far East.”7 The earliest of these petroglyphs, depicting horses and bison, found near Shishkino on the Lena River, compare favorably in style with the Aurignacian cave drawings of France. But then: “As the ice age waned and the land changed, so did the animals depicted in the rock drawings.” At Shishkino, the Aurignacian style was replaced by that of the Mesolithic age, with drawings of reindeer superimposed on the figure of the earlier bison, with the elk be- coming the dominant figure in the even later Neolithic age.8 Also during the Neolithic period, with which we are not yet concerned, the male human figure took prominence over that of the female. Animals became secondary in eminence.? A change of focus had obviously taken place. There is no point in belaboring the issue. Enough has been said. Even so, Arctic regions temporarily aside, what was it really like during our postulated scheme beneath the polar</p>",

Better still, what did man himself had to tell us about these times? </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>THE MYTHO</center></b></p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>HISTORICAL CONNECTION</center></b></p>\n<p>Since man came into his being during the Ice Age, it would not have been possible for him to have remembered its onset. But what of his existence during its course of time? In writing about ice ages, Windsor Chorlton could not help but note a class of Scandinavian myths which describe Earth and the heavens as having been “made from the body of a great frost giant who materialized out of mists rising from melting ice—ice that had once impris- oned the entire universe.”! He then goes on to state that: “Perhaps such tales represent ancient memories of the Ice Age; if so, they are among the few folkloric allusions to the glacial past. Although fully modern humans wit- nessed the waning of the most recent ice age, even the oldest legends contain no im- ages of retreating glaciers or warming climates. People of many cultures tell each other of cataclysmic floods that once covered the world with water, but never speak of a time when towering ice sheets blanketed much of the earth.”? We should not blame Chorlton for this naive generalization since, after all, even he had just told us of the Scandinavian belief in ice that had once imprisoned the entire “universe.” It is not true, however, that the mytho-historical record has nothing to say about “retreating glaciers and warming climates.” In fact, such a sequence is contained in the very Scandina- vian tales he himself referred to. Although by the time the Voluspa was put into writing the events which concern us had long passed away, enough of early man’s memory was retained, even if in a somewhat ambiguous fashion. This very Voluspa speaks of an original land of ice, darkness, and mist situated in the north. From the south, rivers flowed toward the land of ice, where they became frost-bound and died in the icy vastness. But later, so these legends proclaim, there arose a south wind which brought warm air with it and the ice was melted.3 One may think that, coming from the geographical area of Scandinavia, snow and ice would feature prominently in their mythology, although, to be sure, they do not fea- ture that prominently in the sagas of other northern people. But what, then, of the Jewish nation? Did they not also preserve a memory of Earth’s primeval cold? In recounting the sequence of Creation as supposedly received from his god, Enoch spoke of “the treasure houses of the snow” and “the storage houses of the cold.”4 In a different tract, Yahweh is also made to ask Job: “Out of whose womb came the ice and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? The waters are hid as with a stone and the face of the deep is frozen.”&gt;</p>",
