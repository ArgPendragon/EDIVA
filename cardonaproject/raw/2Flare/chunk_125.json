Looking a little like candy, they have even been mistaken exactly for that and eaten by early prospectors working in Nevada who found them sweet, but “sickish’” enough to cause nausea.! “A pack-rat midden,” the paleoecologist Peter Wigand explains, “is a snapshot of the flora and fauna existing within about 50m of the midden at the time it was accumulating.”? By dat- ing the middens, scientists can tell what the climate was like at that particular time. Thus, for instance: “Using midden evidence of tree growth and distribution in the Mojave Desert, bota- nist W. Geoffrey Spaulding...determined that average desert temperatures during the height of the last Ice Age, about 18,000 years ago, were 6°C colder than they are today.” Of greater importance to our study, however, middens “can reveal changes in the heavens as well as on earth.”4 This was demonstrated by the hydrologist Fred Phillips by checking an ancient midden for evidence of cosmic ray bombardment. As Leon Jaroff explains, “highly energetic cosmic-ray particles create the radioisotope chlorine 36 when they strike argon atoms in the atmosphere” and the isotope then “finds its way into plants and the urine of mammals, including the pack-rat.”5 Calling on the aid of radio-chemist Pankaj Sharma, Phillips “compared the amount of chlorine 36 in the midden urine with contemporary values, and con- cluded that cosmic-ray bombardment was 41% more intense 21,000 years ago than it is now.”6 “This suggests that the earth’s magnetic field, which acts as a partial barrier to cosmic rays, was then considerably weaker.”” There is one problem here and it concerns the dating of the middens which is derived through the radiocarbon method in which, for reasons already supplied, we do not have much faith. So let us not take that “21,000 years ago” as an exact figure. The best that we can do is accept the date as having been earlier than our benchmark figure of 10,000 years ago. What this means is that, at that time, Earth’s magnetic field was less than 0.62 gauss. But if, as al- ready noted, it has also been discovered that Earth’s magnetic field was three times stronger than at present during the time of the dinosaurs, it would mean that it had decayed between then and that approximate 21,000 years ago. If that, however, is the case, the field would then have had to have been boosted some time later than 21,000 years ago in order for it to be able to decay once more to its present low value. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>PROPOSED CAUSES</center></b></p>\n<p>Returning now to polarity reversals we ask: What could have caused Earth’s magnetic field to reverse itself?

Worse still, as admitted by Mandelkehr: “There is no firm agreement as to the causal source of these reversals.” By 1972, some authorities, including Harold Urey, were of the opinion that geomagnetic reversals can be caused by Earth’s interaction with external bodies such as comets or meteoric swarms.? (The irony here is that Urey had once served as one of the most bitter critics of Velikovsky who had earlier proposed just such a cause.) This was later taken up by Victor Clube in his endeavor to ascribe just about all past catastrophes to Earth’s interaction with comets and cometary debris. As he wrote: “Lesser impacts which are more common are quite capable of reversing the Earth’s magnetic field...No other theory explains this particular phenomenon at the mo- ment...”</p>",

        "content": "<p>This was emphasized and elaborated upon by Clube and his co-author, Bill Napier, in their opus magnum of 1982. As they there explain: “Whatever mechanism operates, the geomagnetic dynamo [which is held to be re- sponsible for the generating of Earth’s electro-magnetic field] is apparently very un- stable and this is supposed to give rise to spontaneous field reversals...Suppose now that the Earth was struck by a comet or an asteroid, moving at some random angle...Because the crust and mantle are very rigid they will respond as a whole, and within the global travel time of earthquakes (say less than an hour) they will have ac- quired a new velocity and axis of rotation. The change in both will be min- ute... However the core, being liquid, will at first carry on rotating in the old sense. This modest impact is therefore enough to spin the overlying mantle, creating friction at the boundary of core and mantle so forcing a completely new velocity pattern on to the circulation currents at the top of the core...There is therefore, over this period, a major redistribution of velocities within the core, and since as we have seen the geomagnetic dynamo is very unstable, one expects that the magnetic field will be strongly perturbed and may rapidly flip over.”! The problem with this scenario, as Clube and Napier themselves state, is that the change in the velocity of Earth’s rotation and the direction of its axis resulting from such an impact “will be minute.” It is difficult to conceive how such a minute change could completely flip Earth’s magnetic field. Even if such a reversal would have been initiated under such conditions, it is doubtful that the reversal would have been completed. The best that one can expect from such a minute change is an aborted field reversal, that is an excursion, as described above—which would still leave complete and durable reversals unexplained. The notion that geomagnetic reversals can be caused by cometary and/or asteroidal im- pacts did not go away. Years after Clube and Napier proposed their theory, and without even a nod in their direction, Richard Muller and Donald Morris, who then hailed from California’s Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, claimed that “there is strong evidence” for exactly what Clube and Napier had proposed. What these two theorists suggested is that if such a body, “nearly two miles in diameter,” were to hit Earth “at a speed of 5,600 miles per hour,” the dust and smoke that it would raise would block sunlight long enough to cause “a drop in land temperatures.” “But since water retains heat longer than soil, the oceans remain relatively warm. The result is a sudden (within a few hundred years) drop in sea level, by 33 feet or more. This in turn changes the rotation rate of Earth’s crust and mantle relative to its liquid core. Result: a switch in the magnetic field.”?</p>",
