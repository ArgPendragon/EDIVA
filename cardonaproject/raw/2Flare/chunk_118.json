Correct dating requires a correct dating technique. But most methods can only date objects and/or the carbonized remains of objects. They are not very useful when it comes to dating the end of an epoch, an era, or a shorter age. At present, the radiocarbon method is the technique most favored by archaeologists. Although, like others, it cannot be used to supply us with an absolute date for the end of the Paleolithic age, it at least has been used to date various articles from that period.” If nothing else, this should give us an idea concerning the antiquity of the age in question. But is the radiocarbon method really all that accurate? Debates on this issue have ranged since the introduction of the method by Willard Libby. Right from its inception, certain anomalies came to light which raised the undesired voice of criticism. As time went by and more items were tested, the anomalies accumulated at an unrea- sonable rate. Archaeologists began to cast doubt on the validity of the method. Eventually a corrective measure was introduced into the radiocarbon method through reliance on dendro- chronology. Unfortunately, this technique, which is based on the counting and matching of tree rings, is just as faulty as the one it is meant to correct.3 And even then, the anomalies did not disappear; on the contrary they continued to accumulate. At bottom, of course, lies the fact that the radiocarbon method depends on the assumption that the atmospheric content of Carbon-14 has been constant throughout Earth’s history. But, as various authorities have demonstrated, nearby supernovae tend to increase the carbon-14 content in our atmosphere.* This, alone, is enough to throw the entire radiocarbon method of dating out of kilter. I could end my argument there, but consider also this: If “nearby” superno- vae, by which astrophysicists mean anything up to 500 pc,&gt; can upset the Carbon-14 content in our atmosphere, how much more would the much closer proto-Saturnian flare-up have dis- rupted Earth’s atmospheric Carbon-14 production? Added to all this is the fact that archaeologists do not always agree among themselves con- cerning the age of items, sites, strata, and periods. Nor have the attributed dates been known to be constant through the years. This latter is perhaps understandable since newer discoveries, to say nothing of newer methods, tend to refine older dates. But, given the yo-yoing of dates through the years, one remains hard-pressed to come to a definite conclusion about the abso- lute age of anything in the prehistoric past. Thus, for instance, in 1961, the retreat of the Ice Age was calculated to have transpired in 18,000 B.C.; the end of the Magdalenian period was</p>",

The end of the Ice Age was there believed to have transpired sometime between 9000 and 8000 B.C.,? with the end of the Magdalenian, the entire Paleolithic, and the advent of the Neolithic (including the Mesolithic) all occurring around 10,000 B.C.3 In continental Europe, where, to confuse matters further, an entirely different terminology has been adopted, what is termed the Wiirm Glaciation, which is the last period of the Pleistocene Ice Age, is dated at 125,000 years ago, which would have ended about 11,000 years ago at the beginning of the Holocene.* The Pa- leolithic art at Lascaux has been dated at 15,515 + 900 years, with deposits from the Middle Magdalenian period at 14,050 years.5 These last two items, however, have absolutely nothing to tell us about the end of the Paleolithic which, given the above dates, would have to be later than 14,000 B.C. With so many confusing dates flying around, I refuse to be pigeonholed. As Frederic Jue- neman stated some time back: “Too many difficulties in our present dating methods prevent even an attempt to establish the timing with anything approaching precision.”6 Fair enough, there have been finer refinements through the years since Jueneman wrote the above, but, even then, it all depends on which authority one wishes to rely. In any case, I am not about to start splitting hairs at this point, so let us stick to generalities. The best that can be extracted from the above, give or take a little, and in keeping with a round figure, is that the end of the Ice Age and the end of the Paleolithic age coincided some- where around 10,000 B.C. And, since the Neanderthals did not make it into the following Neolithic age, it can be safely stated that they succumbed at around the same time. Would it, therefore, be unreasonable to claim a single cause for all three terminations? </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>A BENCHMARK FIGURE</center></b></p>\n<p>As long as it is kept in mind that this 10,000 years is an approximate and rounded figure, we can use it as a benchmark to pin-point the “date” of proto-Saturn’s flare-up with some accuracy. The next question, therefore, is: Can this date be validated? Using various lines of reasoning in early scenarios which differ from ours, some catastro- phists have nevertheless zeroed in on the same date or one that is not that far off. One excep- tion was Alfred de Grazia who claimed that a “set of [cosmic] catastrophes” took place during the Holocene epoch which he dated at 14,000 years ago.” He then posits a fissioning flare by proto-Uranus, which he termed Super-Uranus, “around 11,500 years ago,” and another by what he termed Super-Saturn “around 6000 years ago.”§ De Grazia based this on the well known</p>",

Unfortunately there is nothing in the mytho-historical record that can be attributed to the planet Uranus. Not only that, but, although Uranus can indeed be discerned, given good acuity of vision, with the naked eye in an unpolluted sky, the fact remains that the planet went unrec- ognized, and thus undocumented, by all ancient observers. It even evaded the eyes of modern man up until 1781 when, as is well known, William Herschel discovered it. Velikovsky himself would not commit to an exact date, giving instead a somewhat wide range, but leaning heavily toward our benchmark. “I am not in a position to point to the cen- tury or even millennium when the Universal Deluge took place,” he wrote, “but it must have happened between five and ten thousand years ago, probably closer to the second figure.”! As already noted, to Velikovsky, although not to us, the “Universal Deluge” followed seven days after proto-Saturn’s flare-up, so that his date is also applicable to his Saturnian nova. Peter Warlow, keeping to his scheme which involves a series of partial and complete inver- sions of the terrestrial sphere, also dates one of these events at 10,000 years ago.” J. Bernard Delair places the “last major” invasion of the Solar System by his postulated cosmic visitor, “a fragment of an exploded star,” at 11,500 years ago.&gt; Together with Derek Scott Allan, Delair had previously bolstered this catastrophe through evidence derived from the geological record.+ Similar geological evidence, much of which applies to our own scenario, was also utilized by E. P. Izokh who blamed the catastrophe on Earth’s collision with a comet. He, too, placed this occurrence at about 10,000 years ago. Since none of the above scenarios are identical to ours, with some of them differing con- siderably, it may seem that their inclusion in this work amounts to nothing but a clutching at straws in an endeavor to keep our benchmark figure’s head above the water. But apart from the old adage that wherever there is smoke, there is bound to be a fire, it should be noted that the reasoning and hard terrestrial evidence supplied by the above catastrophists is near-identical to ours even if the actual cause proposed in each instance is not. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>THE ALUMINUM CLOUD</center></b></p>\n<p>While I cannot be definite about the following, the discovery of a cloud of Aluminum-26 just outside the Solar System and surrounding it might turn out to be vital to our hypothesis.

If that is the case, Earth would literally be within this supernova remnant.®</p>",
