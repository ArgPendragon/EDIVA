        "content": "<p>El-Shaddai remained the god of the Israelite Patriarchs until the advent of Moses who adopted the Midianite deity as his own and managed to foist him on the enslaved Israelites. “The theophany of Sinai [where Moses was said to have received Yahweh’s command- ments],” wrote Albright, “then represents the end of the domination of the Shaddai concept and the beginning of the rule of Yahweh.”! That Israel’s old god, known as El, Eloah, and/or Elohim, also known as II or Ilus, was a manifestation of Saturn we have amply documented in our previous volume. That the wor- ship of a sun, identified as Helios in later times, thus again equivalent to Saturn, was rampant from the time of the divided monarchy down into synagogue times, we have noted above. In between these two eras fits the age of Moses and Yahweh. Does this not, then, make one sus- pect that Yahweh, too, might have stood for Saturn? </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>FROM YA TO YAHWEH</center></b></p>\n<p>While Yahweh was the god of the Midianites, it must not be understood that he was only known to this particular tribe. Siegfried Horn tells us that the earliest reference to Yahweh “in any known inscription or text” appears on the Moabite Stone, known also as the Mesha Stele, in which the Moabite king Mesha “makes sport of Israel’s God.”? But this is only true in so far as the name Yahweh is spelled out in full. Theophoric names incorporating a short- ened form of Yahweh are known from other localities. The case for the occurrence of Yahweh in Eblaite texts remains controversial. Mitchell Dahood, for one, found evidence of it. The Ebla tablets, according to him “show that a thou- sand years before [the time of Moses]—and this has produced much excitement, and even consternation, among scholars—both II and Ya, forms equivalent to El and Yahweh, existed in Northwest Semitic personal names.”4 Giovanni Pettinato is of similar opinion. The incor- poration of the element Ya in Eblaite personal names, he has argued, “might be a short form of Yau, which could be the Ebla prototype of the God of the Hebrews.”&gt; Paolo Matthiae, on the other hand, disagrees. “In my opinion,” he is quoted as saying, “the claimed Biblical as- sociations [with the Ebla texts] are not based on real evidence; the divine name Yahweh does not appear at all in Ebla texts.”6 That may be so, but was the name of the god in question always rendered as “Yahweh”? That a form of the name Yahweh appears in Amorite names of Mesopotamia and Syria has been shown by Cyrus Gordon and Gary Rendsburg.? The same god was even known in</p>",

        "content": "<p>Egypt. As Gordon testified, “several Egyptian texts refer to ‘Yhw in the land of the no- mads...”! Apart from theophoric names, the god Yahweh was worshipped in Gebal as is indicated by the history of Sanchoniathon. As Stephen Langdon vouched: “Sanchounyathon [a different transliteration of the name] was undoubtedly a Phoeni- cian writer...as the statement of Porphyry, preserved in Eusebius, asserts. He based his history [according to some] upon Yerombalos, a priest of Yeuo, undoubtedly the god Yaw, who is thus proved to have been worshipped at Gebal as early as 1000 B.C. In a mound north-west of Beisan, modern Ta’annek, has been found a letter of the fifteenth century [B.C.] in cuneiform by Ahi- Yami, which proves that Yaw was [also] a deity of the Canaanites.”? There are, of course, those who have claimed that Sanchoniathon was himself a Phoeni- cian priest who copied the sacred inscriptions from the inscribed pillars in the temple of Mel- kart, others say of Ba’al Hamon, at Tyre, when these crashed to the ground in an earthquake. Even so, that Yaw was a form of Yahweh we know from the Jewish colony which existed in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. at Elephantine in Southern Egypt. Writing in Aramaic, these Jews pronounced the name of their deity as “Yaw.”3 In fact, as Langdon informs us, the god’s proper name seems always to have been Yaw but, for controversial reasons, it was eventually extended to Yahweh, sometimes rendered Jehovah. “A name Yahweh, [or] Jeho- vah [however], never existed.”4 In the northern kingdom of Israel, Yahweh was actually called Yo; in the southern kingdom of Judah, he was called Yahu.5 That Ya seems to have been the original form of the name has also been sustained by Godfrey Rolles Driver.6 Those who have argued for Ya being merely a shortened form of Yahweh, rather than the original full name, are therefore incorrect. As Driver pointed out: “It is a priori improbable that a name held so sacred as Yahweh would be commonly abbreviated” and that “no other Semitic race ever shortened the names of its gods.”” In the meantime there has been much speculation that theophoric names incorporating the element Ya or its equivalents appear in cuneiform texts dating from the last millennium B.C.8—despite Driver’s contention to the contrary?</p>",
