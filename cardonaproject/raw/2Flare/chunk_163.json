But few, by far, end up inheriting survival values that are higher than that of the original. In the natural world, mutants are usually eliminated quite rapidly by natural selection—and, despite the vociferous objections by other catastrophists, natural selection does hold sway in normal conditions. That mutated animals can breed and reproduce their mutated forms is exemplified by those magnificent beasts, the white tigers which have been made famous by the illusionists Siegfried and Roy in Las Vegas. The white tiger, a partial albino, developed as a mutant strain of the Bengal tiger. Up until 1951, only nine had been sighted in the jungles of India. At present, numerous white tigers continue to breed in international zoos as they continue to do in India.! As far as is known, Bengal tigers did not mutate into white tigers due to disastrous condi- tions. The same cannot be said for the voles of Chernobyl.

In most cases, however, mutational flaws are not passed on to offspring. This is well known through various birth defects which, while rare, occur in the animal kingdom. Animals born with two heads or more than four limbs might survive. Unfortunately, among the thousands of fossils so far unearthed, the remains of any such beasts would be difficult to recognize. Skeletons of animals with two heads, five limbs, or other deformities could easily be mistaken for the incomplete remains of two or more individuals. Moreover, these monstrosities would have given birth to normal individuals, which is why the fossil record remains silent on the issue. But, for a while following proto-Saturn’s flare-up, these malformations would have probably been numerous enough for man to have noticed their existence among the surviving herds of normal animals. More than that, ancient man would have known enough to realize that these misshapen creatures constituted novel forms which had not previously existed. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>CREATURES NEW AND STRANGE</center></b></p>\n<p>That ancient man seems to have retained a memory of prehistoric animals the forms of which succumbed once the age of darkness came to an end is recorded by Berossus in a frag- ment preserved by Polyhistor where it is told that: “In the beginning, all was darkness and water, and therein were generated monstrous animals of strange and peculiar forms.”? Among such animals might have been the woolly mammoth, the giant cave bear, the saber- toothed tiger, and the megatherium. Those who came later would have received reports of these wild beasts by word of mouth from those who had actually seen them. There was no other way in which late comers would have realized that such forms were no longer in exis- tence. As with the intensity of the darkness itself, the nature of these beasts were later exag- gerated, endowing some of them with multiple heads and/or bodies, including such mon- strosities among the breeds of man himself. This belief, complete with similar exaggerations, is also encountered on the other side of the world among the Zuni Indians.? One can actually imagine the old timers telling these tales around campfires and being asked how monstrous could these beasts have been. Hyperbole would have been utilized in order to impress, and these exaggerations would have multiplied with the telling of the tales. And yet, as we shall soon see, some of these embellishments might not really have been all that implausible. Another snippet preserved by Ovid is included by the Roman poet in his version of Deu- calion’s flood, a Greek legend that stretches back into dim antiquity. Unfortunately this legend has gone through various transformations, especially when it comes to the dating of the event. While this is not the place to debate this particular issue, I must here borrow credence in claiming that the passage I have in mind was added by Ovid as a postscript to the tale out of chronological order because that is where it seemed logical for him to place it. In other words, without any real evidence to back me up, I am here proposing that the datum in</p>",

        "content": "<p>question originated as a dim memory of the events following the melting of the Pleistocene glaciation and the incursion of the sea before it was grafted to the tale of Deucalion’s flood. Judging by the different flood legends in which the Greeks believed, the confusion of one with the other seems more than obvious.! “So when the earth, all muddied by the recent flood, grew warm again, under the kindly radiance of the sun in heaven [Ovid tells us in this snippet], she brought forth countless forms of life. In some cases she reproduced shapes which had been previ- ously known, others were new and strange.”? While our thesis is not reliant on the above, it should be kept in mind that no creatures “new and strange” are known to have made their appearance following the end of the Pleisto- cene Ice Age, whereas the temporary appearance of mutated animals following proto- Saturn’s flare-up is more than merely probable. Thus, in our own scenario, “the kindly radiance of the sun in heaven” that Ovid mentions would have been the radiance of the proto- Saturnian sun. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>HUMANITY IN CRISIS</center></b></p>\n<p>Man is the most intelligent animal on Earth. For that reason he would have proven better at seeking shelter from catastrophes than the lower animals. In the face of calamities, the beasts of the Earth are wont to panic. Man, too, tends to panic in such situations. But he is better at overcoming terror than the brutes of the land. Moreover, man is a fast learner. Expe- rience would have taught him to recognize the signs of impending disasters. His chances of survival thus bear an edge over that of beasts. It is not that he would not have succumbed, and in great number, to the sort of adversities we have been studying. The number of people killed in earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, and other ravages of nature in the present world is enough to demonstrate that much larger numbers would have fallen prey to the more tremendous and extensive devastations with which we are concerned. But it would be in keeping with man’s nature if we were to insist that, at least percentage-wise, fewer people would have fallen prone to these destructions than animals at large. Here it is worthwhile noting that, when compared to the colossally vast number of Pleistocene animals, human population was a mere drop in the proverbial bucket. More than that, while the members in most of these Pleistocene herds would have numbered in the thousands, the number of humans in a tribal clan would hardly have been counted in the hundreds. For that reason we should expect to find fewer remains of human victims among the fossils that can be dated to the end of the Pleistocene. But, worldwide, even these few should number in the thousands. Where do we find their graveyards? Remains consisting of several hundred human skeletons have been dug out of calcareous tufa from the banks of the Rio Santas in Brazil. These were mixed with sea shells which proves that the remains were deposited by marine action.?</p>",
