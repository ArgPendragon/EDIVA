It is therefore not surprising that, while the writing of this book was in progress, discover- ies continued to be made at an ever increasing rate, many of which added further evidence in support of the thesis presented in the foregoing chapters. While nothing that is strictly new has emerged in the interim, the inclusion of these discoveries should not be viewed as redundant because, in a thesis so heavily at variance with presently received opinion on many a subject, we have to buttress our position with as much evidence in its favor as we can lay our hands on. What might therefore be seen as repetitive in some of what follows below has been included to show that, regardless of what critics might come up with, there is nothing in these discoveries that contradicts our scheme. We have come a long way since the mid-1950s when Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin went on record in stressing that electromagnetic phenomena are of no importance in space.! Would that she, and those who blindly repeated her false assertions, had paid greater heed to the likes of Hannes Alfvén who had long been proclaiming what eventually was found. But then, bless their souls, when astrophysicists did eventually realize that the Universe is permeated with magnetic fields, they hamstrung themselves into believing that these fields are of “unforeseen power and unknown origin.”? “A galactic field must somehow be generated from scratch, amplified to the strength now observed, ejected into intergalactic space and further amplified there. Each stage poses problems.” “The only place where you have that much energy,” Stirling Colgate announced, “is a su- permassive black hole.”4 Earlier I would have said that until such black holes, supermassive or otherwise, are somehow detected, their existence must remain in the realm of speculation. But before this work went to press, news came in from mainstream physicists stressing what had been indicated five years earlier’ that black holes do not exist. “If new calculations are correct, the universe just got even stranger.

For whatever reason, astrophysicists have a tendency to ignore the fact that magnetic fields can only be generated by electric currents. As we have often stated, the Universe is now generally accepted to be 99% composed of plasma which conducts electricity and generates magnetic fields in all of space. Our reliance on these forces, and the phenomena they lead to, in the reconstruction of Earth’s past history as set forth in the past chapters of this volume cannot therefore be objected to. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>BROWN DWARF STARS</center></b></p>\n<p>Brown dwarf stars have now been numbered at 100 billion, rivaling the quantity of so- called “normal” stars in our galaxy.? The proposal that proto-Saturn commenced its career as such a star which had been floating alone in space might have raised scientific eyebrows in the past. Not so these days. Although some brown dwarfs do orbit sun-like stars, the majority of them float through the galaxy independently.3 The similarity between dwarf stars and our posited proto-Saturnian sun does not end there. That proto-Saturn could have acted as a dim sun is given credence by what is being discovered about brown dwarfs most of which are actually red.4 As Subhanjoy Mohanty and Ray Jayawardhana have assured their readers, the atmosphere of young brown dwarfs should closely resemble those of low-mass stars.&gt; In fact, as the same authorities, to say nothing of others, tell us, brown dwarfs occupy an intermediate slot between planets and stars.® The mytho-historical record upon which we initially based our proto-Saturnian scenario also led us to believe that proto-Saturn was surrounded by a placental cloud, otherwise known as a circumstellar disk. That such disks encircle brown dwarf stars is now universally ac- cepted.’ In fact, as the above authorities tell us, disks around brown dwarfs are ubiquitous.’ “Of those surveyed,” they report, “more than half evince infrared disk signatures, and the fraction may be as high as 80 percent” and that “brown dwarfs are girdled by disks just as often as stars</p>",

The planetary raw material that has been detected in these disks include small olivine crystals and large dust grains.? “This is exciting because we did not know whether these very light disks would evolve similarly to disks around stars,” Daniel Apai reported. “[But] we now understand that not only do they evolve similarly, but they process their dust rapidly.” So, likewise, when it comes to the column of light emanating from proto-Saturn’s south polar axis which the mytho-historical record also led us to. That jets are created by plasmoids has long been known. These jets are “shot” in opposite direction from both poles of the plas- moid.4 Such bi-polar jets have not only been detected emanating from stars but have actually been photographed. And similar bi-polar jets have also been detected emanating from brown dwarf stars.6 More than that, bi-polar jets seem to be closely associated with circumstellar disks,” To add to all this, we also find that individual outflows have a tendency to come together and twist into helical filaments.’ Sometimes described as “corkscrew-shaped,” these jets are Birkeland currents which also act as colossal planetary tornados, which is hinted at when de- scribed as “outflowing jets and winds.”!° When discovered, at only 24 Jupiter-masses, one jetting brown dwarf, tagged 2MASS1207- 3932, was hailed as being “by far the smallest object known to drive an outflow.”!! This process, too, has led astrophysicists to suggest that brown dwarfs form in the same manner that stars do.!2, Moreover, as Thomas Ray noted, if such jets can, as they do, form from the centre of galaxies, ordinary stars, and brown dwarfs, there is no reason jet-like emissions could not continue to form all the way “downwards to the planetary stage.”!3 This becomes especially so in the case of giant gas planets like Jupiter, which planet is now unremarkably described as being “similar to a star” in composition, sending out “into space more than one and-a-half times the heat it receives from the sun.”!4 Ray is also of the opinion that planets like Jupiter</p>",
