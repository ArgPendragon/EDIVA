        ],
        "content": "<p>One way out of this problem would be to suggest that the Moon- and Earth-mass objects had formed the cores of the two gas giants. In fact, it is now believed that the cores of Jupiter and Saturn are much smaller than previously believed.! But, even then, in order to hold on to their massive atmospheres, these cores could not be smaller than 3 to 10 Earth-masses.? So how could a Moon- or Earth-mass body hold on to such atmospheres? Besides, why would one planet explode to produce asteroids, while another exploded to produce comets? Also, did he not himself also tell us that gas giants “would be expected to leave no asteroids if they exploded.” But, worst of all, it is bad enough to burden one planet with an unknown explosive mechanism, but to burden six of them, and then have them explode in pairs in or near the same locality is stretching an untested model way too far. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>ONE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM</center></b></p>\n<p>Let us, however, leave the above problems alone and concentrate on those 3.2 million years ago. These 3.2 million years are still nowhere close to the few thousand required by our thesis. But, as I noted in 1986,4 let me not disregard Van Flandern’s 4 (or 3.2) million years—for I can also accommodate them. As I reported in 1983, “there is corroborating evi- dence which implies that [proto-]Saturn was disrupted more than once.” And if ancient man remembers more than one Saturnian catastrophe, “there is a possibility that further [proto]Saturnian disasters had occurred prior to the advent of humankind itself.”&gt; What, then, is there against one of these earlier catastrophes having occurred 4 or 3.2 mil- lion years ago? What is there against one of them having occurred 16 million years ago, as Ovenden originally claimed? And earlier still? Did I not also suggest that “therein might lie the answer to the great extinctions of life at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary and the annihi- lation of the dinosaurs”?6 As we have seen, Ovenden’s original postulate called for a ring of material rather than a planet. The change of his 90 Earth-mass object from a ring to a planet was forced upon him because he could not see how or why such a ring should suddenly disperse. The problem, however, is not even slightly minimized because, as Ovenden himself confessed, there is no known mechanism whereby a planet can explode. Even Van Flandern had to accede to this when he reported that “some scientists maintain that no known process can explain how plan- ets could get enough energy to explode.”? Among these scientists one can name Hannes Alfvén and Gustaf Arrhenius who were vehement in stating that: “It is not generally realized that there are no known processes by which such large bodies can be blown apart...”8 As</p>",

        "content": "<p>they add: “It is doubtful if a body larger than about a thousand kilometers in size can ever be blown apart by collision with another body in the solar system.”! To be fair, in 1999 Van Flandern did propose three possible mechanisms for such plane- tary disruptions. The first of these involved a phase change when planetary core temperatures and pressures reach a critical point, leading to a volume discontinuity. An Earth-sized planet in this condition would then either implode or explode “depending on whether the volume decreases or increases.”? The second possible mechanism he proposed was nuclear fission due to natural fission reactors such as those discovered right here on Earth, and which would have been more energetic in the past.3 And the third concerns the unaccountable blockage of heat flow from the continually regenerated gravitational field, which would disrupt the planet’s equilibrium. “The energy excess in the interior of such a planet,” he wrote, “would build indefinitely until either the insulating layer was breached or the planet blew itself apart.”4 However, as Van Flandern himself confesses, these are nothing but “theoretical conjectures.”5 When it comes to the asteroids, which both Ovenden and Van Flandern saw as the debris of their exploded planet, Alfvén and Arrhenius claim that this could not have been the case. As they indicate: “It is also clear from the spin distribution of asteroids that they cannot origi- nate by explosion of much bigger bodies.”6 So, likewise, when it comes to meteorites: “The accretion, fragmentation and irradiation record in meteorites clearly does not reflect processes taking place in the ‘regolith’ of a planet-size parent body, miraculously created and later exploded.”” Also, if Alfvén and Arrhenius are correct, rather than being the product of exploding planets, short period comets have accreted from meteoroids.® “Planetary encounters of long-period meteoroids perturb their orbits into short- period, predominantly prograde orbits with lower eccentricities. These meteoroids are focused into short-period meteor streams, and short-period comets then accrete within these streams.”? If this is correct, short-period comets cannot be anywhere as old as Van Flandern calcu- lates. “In striking contrast to the long lifetime of short-period meteoroids is the short lifetime of short-period comets, which according to observations is only 100-10,000 yr.”!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Conversely, Alan Stern is of exactly the opposite opinion in that comets, “though con- structed of ancient material, cannot themselves be ancient.” Instead, claims Stern, “they must be ‘recently’ created chips” off larger objects which “formed as a result of violent impacts.” When it comes to short-period comets, this seems to be even more applicable. “This is truly a paradigm shift,” says Stern. “Many of the short-period comets we see aren’t even ancient!”? It is not, however, said what is meant by “ancient.” Fair enough, with such contrasting views, all that can be said for certain is that not enough is yet known concerning the formation of comets, so that one may argue that Van Flandern may still be correct in this. Our own scenario, on the other hand, is not necessarily encumbered with the origin of comets so that, for the time being, we can leave this topic aside. But, despite Van Flandern’s own attempts, this would still leave the problem concerning the mechanism that would have caused Ovenden’s and Van Flandern’s planet(s) to explode. I am therefore being only partly mischievous when I ask: In view of Ovenden’s wavering between a ring and a planet, why not think of a ringed planet? How would this get rid of the problem? It is doubtful that a 90 Earth-mass planet, which is what Ovenden’s original postulate called for, would have been entirely solid. Nothing that massive exists in a totally rigid state in our Solar System. A Saturn-size planet, which is what a 90 Earth-mass planet amounts to, would probably have been akin to Saturn—in other words a gas giant as, indeed, Van Flandern himself proposed for some of his exploded planets. And since, despite some earlier disclaimers, Saturn is still more star-like than planet-like, a nova-like outburst is not only feasible, but so is a recurring one. Thus, in contradistinction to Van Flandern, only one body is required. The difference, as we have seen with novae and supernovae, is that gaseous bodies can flare up without annihilating themselves, where the emitted material would mainly be in gaseous form. I am not sure how a recurring proto-Saturnian flare-up would fit Ovenden’s Principle of Least Interaction Action or whether this would satisfy his conclusion that the Solar System is still in the process of recovering from some past catastrophic event. Although it would have been reduced in mass, unlike Ovenden’s planet Aztex, or Van Flandern’s multiple planets, proto-Saturn did not annihilate itself. But with a change of mass to start with and some read- justments of orbits, with the addition of tidal friction and electric forces, a new set of calcula- tions might yet justify the mytho-historic scenario. And while astronomers are not yet ready to admit it, in the end it is history that will carry the day.</p>",
