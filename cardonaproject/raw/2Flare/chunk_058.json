        "main_text": "Chapter 17 Magnetospheric Upheaval THE STAR OF EVIL hile the entry of the proto-Saturnian assemblage into the Solar System seems to have left whatever planets were already in the Sun’s domain unscathed, the cosmic disaster caused by proto-Saturn’s flare-up was not without its repercussions on Earth and its inhabitants. The flare itself was glorious and proto-Saturn continued to be remembered as a god of light. Man was never to forget the glory but he did not much wish to remember that the destruction which followed owed its cause to the manifestation of what had by now become his god. The Hebrews remembered Elohim but, in later times, they disassociated the planet from the god. The planet Saturn itself they named Kewan and on it, rather than on its god, they blamed the tribulations it brought to man. For that reason, they described the planet as “the star of evil which brings misfortune to Israel.”! Only to Israel?— one may ask. The very word “disaster,” from the Latin dis aster or dis astrum, means “evil star.” This came about because, among the Romans, Saturnus was considered “both a good and malevo- lent deity.”? The Latin poet, Marcus Annaeus Lucanus, popularly and simply known as Lu- can, described the same Saturnus as “a baleful star.”3 As Lewis Greenberg noted, “the words ‘saturnine,’ signifying gloomy, and ‘Saturnian,’ meaning Golden Age, offer a strange and almost inexplicable contrast.”4 In the end, this am- bivalence between good and evil resulted in the strange association of God with the Devil. Greenberg, however, was astute enough to recognize that “it would appear that the state of the world was once closely dependent upon, and drastically altered by, the planet Saturn which itself must have undergone a transformation of cosmic magnitude.”> That man tried to forget—although he did not succeed—was not because he willed it so, but because it was painful to remember; because if god, from whom there seems to have been no protection, was a god of destruction, life beneath his cruel sceptre was akin to abject slav- ery, an existence fraught with terror, a future pregnant with evil and impending annihilation. Primitive man found it difficult to live under these conditions and his mind, in a collective at- tempt to retain its sanity, reversed the aspect of reality. Out of a demonic entity—and even",

SHAITAN The ambivalence between good and evil continued to manifest itself among those who actually identified the Creator with Satan? In Hebrew, as used in the Old Testament, the term shaitan “refers not to the personification of evil, but to an adversary,” himself “an agent of the Lord who obstructs or opposes man.” In fact, as A. E. Garvie notes, before the Israelites came in contact with Persian beliefs, “evil, whether as misfortune or as sin” was originally “assigned to divine causality.”4 It was only after their exile, by which time they had been influenced by Persia, that there developed in the Israelite nation a tendency “to separate all evil from God by ascribing its origin to Satan.”> What was the origin of this entity? To be sure, there are some who have seen the name “Satan” as having been derived from “Saturn.” Etymologically, this cannot be accepted since, as already noted, the name Satan is merely the English transcription of the Semitic Shaitan. There are other indications, however, that the entity known as Satan owes its origin to the planetary god in question. The Gospel of Bartholomew names this “adversary of men” as Beliar? (the same as Be- lial), which is merely a different rendering of Bel, whose identity as Saturn has been recog- nized by ancient as well as modern authorities. The Gospel of Matthew, on the other hand, identifies him with Beelzebub (or Beelzebul),? which should be more correctly rendered Ba’al Zebub. Later still, the early Christian Fathers continued to regard Ba’al Zephon as Sa- tan.!0 And yet Ba’al Zephon translates as “Lord of the North,”!! which is a very appropriate title for the Saturnian planetary god situated in Earth’s north celestial pole.!? In the Old Testament—despite Cyrus Gordon and Gary Rendsburg’s more recent apologetics!3—the Israelite El, a common form of the Near Eastern Saturnian deity, is",

Even Yahweh, whom we have already seen identified as a Sat- urnian deity, was equated with Ba’al.2 The Prophet Hosea himself referred to Yahweh as the Ba’al of Israel.3 It therefore becomes evident that Satanic and divine power were am- biguously regarded as having been one and the same. This ambiguity continues to be evidenced by the Gypsy name for “God,” which is devel.4 This is traceable to early Indo-European no- menclature. Thus, as it ended up in Hinduism, the word deva stood for “God.” But according to Persian (or Iranian) tradition, deva stood for “fiend” or “devil.”> It should not therefore be considered strange, as it normally is in the Western world, that a Kurdish tribe known as the Yezidis worship Shaitan as a god. To them, Shaitan represents the real force of divine power.6 All this has been brought out here in order to stress the disparity of the planetary god Sat- urn who continued to be remembered both as the Lord of Light and the Star of Evil.
