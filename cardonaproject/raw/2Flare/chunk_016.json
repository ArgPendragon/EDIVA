Due to the discovery of tropical and sub-tropical remains of plants and animals in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions,? various authorities subscribed to similar ideas in that Earth’s rotational pole must have either shifted its location or tilted its direction in space. It was argued that either one of these changes could also account for the occurrence of ice ages. The pole shift theory received its major impetus in 1970 with the publication of Charles Hapgood’s opus magnum on the subject. The axial tilt theory was aired in 1978 by Jack Wolfe who was quoted as saying that “earth’s axis of rotation was once less inclined toward the sun.” In his view this “could help explain major changes in climate.”4 In March of the same year, in reporting the discovery of fossil amphibians and reptiles in a mountainous region of Antarctica, John Cosgriff, Jr. also came to the conclusion that: “Clearly, the south pole was then elsewhere than on the Antarctic continent.”5 In 1980, John White published a book on the subject which should have won as much ac- claim as Hapgood’s had previously done. A polar shift theory due to a close passage of an unknown planet, named simply Z, was presented at the University of Bergamo symposium in 2001 by W. Wolfli and W. Balten- sperger. Planet Z was there speculated to have been of Martian mass and to have entered the Solar System from the regions of the asteroid belt, the Kuiper Belt, or the Oort Cloud. It may also have originally orbited the giant planet Jupiter. Since it fragmented, with its debris fal- ling into the Sun, planet Z no longer exists.® The problems inherent in these theories of pole shifts and tilts, have already been dis- cussed in the prequel to this volume,’ to which the reader is therefore referred. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>MAGNETIC FIELD COLLAPSE</center></b></p>\n<p>Past reversals of Earth’s magnetic polarity, deduced from the fossil magnetism in rocks, have been acknowledged for some time. This led Frederic Jueneman to hypothesize what could, or would, occur had the terrestrial field actually collapsed. As he reasoned, the greatest effect “of even a partial collapse” of Earth’s magnetic field would “probably” result in an intense cooling. This is a phenomenon that has been observed, albeit on a much smaller scale, in laboratory experiments “where the collapse of a magnetic field induces a cooling effect by slowing or even stopping thermal molecular motion with no net gain or loss of en- ergy.”</p>",

        "content": "<p>“On a planetary-sized scale the cooling effect due to a rapid reduction or collapse of a magnetic field could freeze the atmosphere itself in the vicinity of the magnetic poles, causing the air itself to precipitate as snowflakes in a blizzard. The effects would be far-reaching...”! “Could such a phenomenon have occurred, or more to the point did such a thing indeed happen?” asked Jueneman. “And, if it did, what was the cause?”? To that end, Jueneman found himself toying with the idea that meteoric impacts—to which we shall come below— might “adversely” have affected Earth’s magnetic field “during the last 10 millennia.” But meteors have been known to impact Earth without coming anywhere close to collapsing Earth’s magnetic field. In order for Jueneman’s hypothesis to be seriously considered, one would have to postulate entire fields of sizeable meteors acting in concert, time and again, throughout Earth’s geologic past. Scars of impacts left by such meteoric trains have been identified by some as having excavated the hollows now recognizable as the chain of the Carolina Bays and similar depressions. But can it be shown that an incursion of a meteoric train could collapse Earth’s magnetic field? It seems more likely that such a collapse would require the interaction of an external electromagnetic, or at least an electrical, force. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>METEORIC AND ASTEROIDAL IMPACTS</center></b></p>\n<p>1988 saw a revival of the meteoric impact theory as a cause for ice ages. Frank Kyte, Lei Zhou, and John Wasson, all from the University of California, blamed the most recent series of ice ages on the fall of a 500 meter diameter meteor which landed in the east Pacific basin some 2.3 million years ago. By throwing up some 20 billion tonnes of water into the strato- sphere, an enveloping cloud would have possibly risen to Earth’s high altitudes, blocking sunlight over the poles, thus instigating an ice age. For evidence, Kyte and his colleagues pointed to a high concentration of meteoric particles found in sediment of this supposed age in a core retrieved from the region, plus high iridium concentrations in six cores drilled up south west of Cape Horn.4 Emilio Spedicato, from the University of Bergamo, Italy, was of similar opinion. Con- structing his argument on the hypothesis of Hoyle and Wickramasinghe, he reached the con- clusion that the last Ice Age was initiated by a meteoric impact on land, and terminated by one in the ocean.&gt; In Hoyle’s case, however, it was oceanic impacts which instigated ice ages—which shows that speculation can be made to account for an either-or cause. As Trevor Palmer, however, rightly concluded: “The impact of an asteroid of about 1 km diameter would undoubtedly have worldwide effects, but it seems unlikely that an event on this scale could, by itself, bring about the start or finish of an ice age, particularly since about</p>",

        "content": "<p>three such impacts would be expected every million years.”! Thus, for instance, when Kyte et al.’s meteor is compared to the comet which was also claimed to have impacted Earth at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, the one which has been blamed for the demise of the dino- saurs, it is legitimate to question Kyte’s conclusion. The amount of atmospheric disturbance that must have been created by the Cretaceous-Tertiary impact would have dwarfed the at- mospheric disturbance produced by Kyte’s postulated meteor. One is therefore inclined to ask why no ice age ensued at the cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. The twenty-first century saw no abatement of the impact theory. Gregory Jenkins, a me- teorologist hailing from the Pennsylvania State University, advanced the opinion that an as- teroid slammed into Earth four and a half billion years ago, knocking our world on its side. This touched off “a crazy climate that nurtured the first living things but later triggered giant ice sheets in the tropics.”? Although Earth was then much balmier than at present, the young Sun was then much fainter Jenkins explains this by postulating that Earth had been rotating sideways at the time. This would explain why Earth’s present polar circles were much warmer than at pre- sent, even much warmer than present lower latitudes. By the same token, the present equato- rial regions would have taken the place of the present polar circles. This, Jenkins opines, would explain the evidence of glaciers which have been discovered at Earth’s equatorial re- gions between 800 million and 540 million years ago. “When Jenkins modeled what the climate would have been like during that time if Earth’s axis were tilted at a steep, 70-degree angle, ice appeared at the equator.”* How did Earth regain its former, and now present, 23-degree tilt? Jenkins believes that 540 million years ago, at the start of the Cambrian Period, the buildup of continents near the south pole flipped our planet back.5 The possibility of such axial flips due to continental im- balance had, however, already been ruled out years before.® Besides, Jenkins’ theory could, at best, be made to account for but one particular ice age, the one which deposited glacial ice in the equator. It cannot be made to account for those ice ages which deposited glaciers in the northern and/or southern hemispheres. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>COMETS AND COMETARY TAILS</center></b></p>\n<p>In 1979, Fred Hoyle, writing with Elizabeth Butler, opted for the passage of Earth through cometary tails as a cause for ice ages. According to them, Earth’s upper atmosphere would suddenly have acquired a vast amount of dust from such a passage and that this would have increased the reflective power, or albedo, of the atmosphere which would have pre- vented solar radiation from reaching Earth’s surface.
