Radio flares were also detected being emitted from the same brown dwarf star. These ra- dio emissions “spiked up to 10,000 times stronger than what astronomers thought possible, indicating an intense flare of energy that may be similar to flares on the Sun.” “In regular stars [Arnold Benz reported], radio and X-ray emissions are related proc- esses. Radio waves are created by the interaction of electrons with a star’s magnetic force, which sends magnetic loops out through hot plasma above the surface. [T]hese electrons follow a star’s magnetic field lines down into the cooler surface, where they heat gases and generate X-rays.”3 And yet it is obvious that Benz was not quite happy with his own analogy since he also stated that it is possible that “brown dwarfs might emit radio waves via a completely different process than normal stars.” And that, at least in part, is because brown dwarfs are not supposed to burn hydrogen the way a “normal” star is supposed to do, although they do burn deuterium.&gt; But there is another aspect of LP 944-20 which throws doubt on Benz’s analogy, and that is the fact that it “emits radio waves much more intensely and energetically than would be expected, based on its known X-ray emissions.”6 Knowing so little about brown dwarfs, even as of this writing, it is doubtful that the above mechanisms are correct in all their details. It does however indicate that radio waves and X-ray emissions are intimately tied up with the dwarf stars’ electric, magnetic, and plasma environment. As noted, these sudden discharges have been said to be similar to solar flares rather than actual nova-like outbursts. But with radio flares 10,000 times stronger than X-ray emissions would otherwise indicate from an object the mass of which is only 6 percent that of the Sun,” one begins to wonder. X-rays themselves are believed to “super-heat convecting plasma sheets, and eventually dissipate high-energy radiation into space.” That similar radiation, or cosmic rays, are also born during supernova explosions is well known.? And that dwarf stars can explode as su- pernovae has also been theorized.!° In fact, by 2003, astronomers were talking about dwarf</p>",

Six of these, all said to be well-known, have been found to flare up “every few weeks or months.” As proposed by Liller in 1997, these outbursts are believed to occur when the dwarf spills gas into a white dwarf companion. And yet, as always the case with these new discoveries, all of these six dwarf novae staggered astronomers by being “more luminous than expected.”! Granted that these dwarf novae have been identified as those from red dwarf stars, it should be remembered that brown dwarfs, which can be just as red, are merely the slightly less massive siblings of red dwarfs. And if red dwarfs can flare up in nova-like brilliance, then so can brown dwarf stars. More than that, if these six red dwarfs flare up “every few weeks or months,” they should be classed as recurring dwarf novae, which is what they really are. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>PLASMA DISCHARGES</center></b></p>\n<p>To repeat what Donald Scott has already told us, plasmas at a distance do not “see” each other electrically. What this means is that the Sun’s heliosphere remained electrically unaware of the approaching proto-Saturnian system’s plasmasphere. This plasmaspheric in- visibility, however, is not merely electrical. As Hannes Alfvén noted, plasma sheaths or bubbles are quite often optically imperceptible. Although they were not immediately recognized as such, Solar System plasmaspheres—like the one around Saturn itself, to say nothing of Earth’s—are entirely invisible to the naked eye. What is worse is that even with instrumentation, it is almost impossible to detect them from a distance.* Although invisible, nearer ones, like those within our Solar System, have of course been detected and even mapped. Their revelation has been made possible through the use of instrument-laden spacecraft. But, as Alfvén also tells us: “A spacecraft usually sees [that is, detects] no indication of such a sheet until it actually passes through it.”3 “As it is unlikely that cosmic plasmas have such properties only in those regions which are accessible to spacecraft diagnostics, it is legitimate to conclude that space in general has a ‘cellular structure,’ although this is almost impossible to observe unless a spacecraft penetrates the ‘cell walls’ (current sheets). This means that in dis- tant regions, we cannot hope to detect the cell walls directly. Nor can we tell the size of the cells. It is unpleasant to base far-reaching conclusions on the existence of a structure which we cannot detect directly. But the alternative is to draw far-reaching conclusions from the assumption that in distant regions, the plasmas have properties which are drastically different from what they are in our own neighborhood. This is obviously far more unpleasant than our inability to detect distant ‘cell walls.’ Hence, a thorough revision of our concept of the properties of interstellar (and intergalactic) space is an inevitable consequence of recent magnetospheric discoveries.”+</p>",

        "content": "<p>Now it so happens that plasmas, too, can explode. Plasmas are sustained as long as they remain in electric equilibrium. This equilibrium can however be unbalanced if the plasma en- counters regions of different electrical potential. As Alfvén noted, “the behavior of the plasma depends on the outer circuit.” A stable plasma discharge can become unstable if its resistance is decreased. Such an instability can then lead to an extinction of the plasma’s cur- rent. Alfvén was right to stress that “every electric circuit is explosive” so that if the current is disrupted “‘a release of the whole inductive energy...at the point of disruption will occur.”! “Tf the current disruption is caused by an instability in the plasma, the inductive en- ergy...in the circuit will be released in the plasma. It then causes an explosion which may be violent if [the inductive energy] is large.” I hate to be more technical than I need to be, but I am sure the educated reader will be able to understand the following explanation as offered by Alfvén: “Consider a volume V of space limited by a surface S. The properties of the plasma inside of S depend on the boundary conditions. Thus by changing the current through S, we can change the behavior of the plasma.” In our own scenario, the volume V of space would translate into the volume of the proto- Saturnian plasmasphere. The surface S would be its limiting boundary. The change of current through S was achieved once the proto-Saturnian plasmasphere came in contact with the Sun’s heliosphere. This occurred because the proto-Saturnian system had penetrated into a different, that is higher, electrical environment. Additionally, plasmas can have double sheaths or layers,* and the disruption described above “is often caused by a double layer becoming unstable.” This is because, as in our own scenario, “the voltage drop suddenly increases by orders of magnitude.”® “There are good reasons to suppose that many of the explosive events observed in cosmic physics are produced by exploding double layers [Alfvén tells us]. Examples are magnetic substorms, solar flares, and similar phenomena in ‘flare stars’.”7 Moreover, the violent current surges produced by the explosion of double layers also lead to the acceleration of plasma particles, “sometimes as high as cosmic ray energies”’— which might be tied to the generation of X-rays from both novae, supernovae, and brown dwarf flares.</p>",
