Others, who reject this notion, suggest that a certain ‘old Chaldee tradition’ was ‘the basis of them both’.”! Even so, he was astute enough to also realize that: “If we drop the word ‘Chaldee’ from [the above] statement, it may be regarded as fairly expressing the truth. The Babylonian legend embodies a primeval tradition, common to all mankind...” This is so true that we encounter the same situation in the Creation myth of the Maya on the opposite side of the world. “In [the day known as] Six Cib,” the Chilam Balam naively recounts, “the first candle was made, and thus it was that light was created where there had been neither sun nor moon.”3 The Jews, however, seem never to have been bothered much with this conundrum. Louis Ginzberg informs us that they have always held the light of Genesis to have been entirely dif- ferent and distinct from the light shed by the common heavenly bodies. “The light created at the very beginning is not the same as the light emitted by the sun, the moon, and the stars, which appeared only on the fourth day [of Creation]. The light of the first day was of a sort that would have enabled man to see the world at a glance from one end to the other.”+ All of which perhaps explains why, in the Book of Psalms, Elohim is lauded as having “prepared the light and the sun” as if they were two distinct entities. Writing in 1956, Zsolt Aradi, who, like others before him, had fallen victim to this pit- fall, was still vainly attempting to clamber out of this incongruity. In an effort to reconcile the seeming absurdity of Genesis with the tenets of modern scientific thought, he wrote that: “Many theories of modern cosmology agree even with the minutest details of the Bib- lical account about the creation of the universe. The Bible and theologians have been ridiculed for standing firm on the Mosaic version, which asserts that on the first day God created light. How is it possible to create light on the first day when the sun, the moon, and the stars were created later, i.e., on the fourth day? Modern cosmology, however, offers the following confirmation.”® Perhaps because the Big Bang theory was still novel—although George Gamow’s best- selling book on the subject was already in print’— Aradi’s astrophysical description of the</p>",

        "content": "<p>supposed creation of the Universe was, even then, somewhat primitive. In brief, and according to him, space was originally filled by a cold rarefied gaseous mass which was immersed in total darkness. Through millions of years, this gaseous mass slowly condensed into “billions of small globes.” This condensation produced pressure and thus heat which resulted in “the first nuclear reactions, which increased the temperature even more.” This led to those “billions of small globes,” which he himself refers to as “stars,” becoming incandescent. “Thus,” he tells us, “there was light for the first time”—in other words, the fiat lux of Genesis. “This was not the light of the sun or of the moon,” he wrote, “it was light, material light, the same light as is produced by atomic fission.”! True, this would not have been the light of the Sun or of the Moon, but, even according to him, it would have been the light of billions of stars which, if we are to believe what Genesis states, were still created after the shedding of the light. Let not the educated reader think all this is rather silly because, as I shall soon indicate, this theological conundrum is not one that has succumbed to the vagaries of time. On the contrary, it is still a part of modern religious thought and remains, to this very day, a thorn in the side of many a Christian sect which continues to uphold a creed based on the rigid interpretation of the books of the Old Testament. And, to be sure, Aradi was neither the first nor the last to attempt a reconciliation of the Book of Genesis with astrophysics. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>THE BIRTH OF A THEORY</center></b></p>\n<p>For quite a number of years in his career, Zsolt Aradi held various posts in which he acted as a voice for the Vatican. It is therefore strange that he seems to have been unaware of the work inaugurated by the Belgian Jesuit priest, Georges Lemaitre, which, together with that of George Gamow, he could have utilized to better advantage in attempting to invoke a scientific explanation for the light of Genesis. Most books on the subject stress that Lemaitre, who was also a brilliant astrophysicist, based his theory on the principles of general relativity together with the belief that the galaxies were receding from each other at incredible speed. What this implied to him is that, at some point in the astronomical past, the galaxies of the entire Universe must have occupied the same space. Retrocalculating further back in time convinced him that, at some point in the unknowable past, the entire matter which constituted the galaxies and the stars contained within them had to have existed as an independent mass of condensed substance. Thus, in 1927, he “galvanized cosmologists...with his proposal that a hot, dense ‘primeval atom’ exploded to create the present universe.” Relativity and galaxies aside, Lemaitre obviously familiarized himself with the Creation myths of other nations, especially those which emphasized the formation of a cosmic egg out of which all of creation is said to have tumbled. The myth of the cosmic egg was believed in by a wide section of the ancient world including the Egyptians,? the Phoenicians,‘ the</p>",
