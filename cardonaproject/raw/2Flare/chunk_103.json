Well versed in theology, it is inconceivable that he would not have come across that great commentator on Biblical Scripture popularly known as the Ramban, an acronym for Rabbi Moshe ben Nach- man. As the Israeli nuclear physicist Gerald Schroeder noted in 1990, “the Ramban...had the remarkably modern insight that at the moment after creation, all the matter in the universe must have been concentrated in a tiny speck.”! This led the same Schroeder to argue in detail, very much like Aradi before him, that there is no contradiction to be found between the ac- count of Creation as described in Genesis and the current scientific dictum.? This “insight,” as developed by the Ramban, is identical to that reached by Lemaitre who, in accordance with Papal wishes for its clerical scientists to try their best to reconcile the Old Testament with modern science, pulled this ace out of his sleeve. Nor is this merely my contention. “Lemaitre was not only a very competent scientist with general relativity as his spe- cialty,” Hannes Alfvén noted, “but also a prominent member of the Catholic hierar- chy. To him personally his theory of ‘Il’ Atome primitif? was an ingeneous [sic] syn- thesis of general relativity and the Thomistic dogma of a creation ex nihilo (although he never expressed this explicitly in his papers).”3 Alfvén, however, knew what he was talking about. As it has now become well known: “To Alfvén, the Big Bang [theory, which is what Lemaitre’s conclusions led to] was a myth—a myth devised to explain creation. ‘I was there when Abbe Georges Lemaitre first proposed this theory,’ he recalled...‘He said in private that this theory was a way to reconcile science with St. Thomas Aquinas’ theological dictum of creatio ex nihilo or creation out of nothing’. George Gamow then refined and further expounded Lemaitre’s theory, ending up receiv- ing the main credit for what later became known as the Big Bang theory. (The tag of “Big Bang,” however, was coined somewhat later by Fred Hoyle, who was vehemently opposed to it. He meant it in derision, but the tag stuck.) The Roman Catholic Church was not tardy in responding. With the advent of the theory, Pope Pius XII himself was bold enough to announce that “scientists are beginning to find the finger of God in the creation of the universe.”&gt; As for Lemaitre, it is not surprising that he was later decorated by the Vatican for his scientific achievements.® In the end, the Big Bang theory was embraced by cosmologists and Biblical fundamental- ists alike. Even Isaac Asimov, known better for his science fiction than his science, was influenced to include a long tract on the subject in one of his major works. “There are two</p>",

The first of these, according to him, involves the creation of the Solar System from what he believed to have been the slow collapse of “the formless, chaotic mass of dust and gas” which would eventually have resulted in nuclear fusion, giving birth to the brilliant Sun.2 The second, still according to him, was Lemaitre’s cosmic egg, in other words the Big Bang theory. As he himself reasoned: “Tt is rather dramatic to imagine that ‘Let there be light’ marked the big bang and the initial period of energy-dominance. Light, after all, is a form of energy. “In fact, we might paraphrase the first three verses of Genesis as follows to make them fit the scientific view of the beginning of the Universe: ““To begin with, fifteen billion years ago, the Universe consisted of a structureless cosmic egg which exploded in a vast outpouring of energy’.”+ Popular publications dealing with the Bible were not hesitant in incorporating this new “insight” into their works, as notice Alma Guinness who, in 1988, included the following in one of Reader’s Digest best selling books: “Prevailing scientific theory proposes that the universe was created in a flash of light. This ‘big bang,’ or cosmic explosion, is believed to have occurred some 16 billion years ago. Some see parallels between this modern, scientific theory and the biblical account which opens with God’s command, ‘Let there be light’.”° The irony of it all is that, by 2002, astrophysicists had changed their tune. No light, it was by then assumed, had been emitted at the inception of the Big Bang. As Tim Folger an- nounced: “Fourteen billion years ago, give or take an aeon, the Big Bang created the universe— or did it? If by universe you mean an abysmally black void with no stars, galaxies, planets, or the slightest promise of life, then the Big Bang’s your baby. But if you mean the starry cosmos we see around us today, a universe that includes at least one planet with life, the Big Bang was a bust. For 100 [million?] years after time began, the universe was less interesting than a mud puddle. Only a handful of elements— mostly hydrogen and helium, along with faint traces of lithium and beryllium— ricocheted through fathomless, unending gloom. Had anyone been around at the time</p>",

        "content": "<p>to bet on the future, the smart money would have been on more of the same: darkness, emptiness, death. Yet improbably, miraculously, the universe—the ultimate dark horse—beat those odds. It was reborn. A 100-million-year-long night ended when clouds of hydrogen collapsed and ignited... That moment—when the universe first lit up—was nothing less than a second creation, the one that really counts.””! Of course, die-hard fundamentalists and creationists will not be shaken by this paradigm shift. Some will argue that this fits the Genesis account even better since, in both scenarios, we have the shedding of the light preceded by a lengthy era of darkness. Nor will it amount to anything among them that no one had been around to be able to record it. To them, divine revelation counts more than scientific facts. Neo-catastrophists had different ideas. But, among them, Roger Wescott was too cautious, where in other matters he threw caution to the wind, when he assigned the shedding of the Big Bang light to an unidentified body he referred to simply as Aster. He was, of course, referring to proto-Saturn without committing himself to it. “...although I accept the postulation of a primal Big Bang [he wrote], I relocate that explosive event in both space and time. Instead of regarding it as the occurrence which originated the entire universe at the beginning of time, I regard it as a local occurrence which took place in our solar system only some thousands of years ago...I have chosen to refer to the planet [which caused this ‘local’ bang] as Aster.”? Unlike Aradi and Gerald Schroeder, the Biblical scholar Nahum Sarna could find nothing that can be called scientific in the pages of Genesis. “It should be obvious,” he wrote, “that by the nature of things, none of these stories can possibly be the product of human memory, nor in any modern sense of the word scientific accounts of the origin and nature of the physical world.” “Biblical man, despite his undoubted intellectual and spiritual endowments [Sarna went on], did not base his views of the universe and its laws on the critical use of empirical data. He had not, as yet, discovered the principles and methods of disciplined inquiry, critical observation or analytical experimentation. Rather, his thinking was imaginative, and his expressions of thought were concrete, pictorial, emotional, and poetic. Hence, it is a naive and futile exercise to attempt to reconcile the biblical accounts of creation with the findings of modern science. Any correspondence which can be discovered or ingeniously established between the two must surely be nothing more than mere coincidence.”+</p>",
