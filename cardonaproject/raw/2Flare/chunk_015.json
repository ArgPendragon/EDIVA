        "content": "<p>“Some 300,000 years ago the climate had become so cold that one of Milankovitch’s cool-summer cycles could have extended the northern ice south to northeastern North America and Scandinavia—both regions of heavy snowfall. Back-radiation of solar energy was still further increased, and the first great wave of ice was under way.”! And yet, Emiliani himself was quite critical of the Milankovitch theory. As he explained: “The main difficulty with the Milankovitch theory is that it fails to explain why the Ice Ep- och developed only recently —within the last million years—after 200 million years during which the earth had no ice ages.”? Through what logic can he then bolster his theory by ap- pealing to “one of Milankovitch’s cool-summer cycles”? And then, how would the raising of land-areas, which remain above sea level to this day, have resulted in a colder climate when the same land-areas, now covered with snow and ice, do not do so at present? An analogous theory, the brainchild of William Ruddiman and Maureen Raymo, blamed the possible cause of ice ages on an uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. By thus altering wind di- rection, this would have accentuated climatic swings and altered rain patterns “in a way that caused carbon dioxide to wash out of the atmosphere faster than it once did.” This would have diminished Earth’s greenhouse effect which, in turn, would have led to global cooling.3 But, heavens! —Is the Tibetan Plateau, or the Himalayas of which it is composed, the only uplift of land known to have transpired through Earth’s geologic ages? Granted—it is the highest on Earth, and could thus have served as a greater cause for atmospheric changes. But then it could only be held responsible for one ice age. What about the series of other ice ages? One may argue that other uplifts might have been the cause of other ice ages in the past. But then, since the Tibetan Plateau, and other uplifts, remain uplifted to this day, why are we not still within the grips of an ice age? After all, the changes in wind pattern and rain- fall that these uplifts created are still with us to this day. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>THE VOLCANIC THEORY</center></b></p>\n<p>One theory that regained temporary prominence blamed ice ages outright on the action of volcanoes. While not exactly new, this theory received a boost from Harry Wexler in 1952. Basing his findings on the explosion of Krakatoa, in the East Indies, which occurred on August 27, 1883, Wexler argued that as much as twenty per cent of the sunlight received on Earth can be blocked by just such a series of volcanic eruptions occurring in a relatively short time. Krakatoa has been calculated to have thrown some 13 cubic miles of rock, dust, and ash into the air. Enormous clouds of ash rose up to 20 miles or more into the atmosphere, drifting across the oceans and continents, arriving over Europe three months after the explosion. The Sun’s radiation, as recorded at the Montpellier Observatory in the south of France, dropped “from 30 per cent above normal to 20 per cent below normal.” As Wexler proposed: “A long</p>",

Previous theorists, among them P. and F. Sarasin and W. J. Humphreys, could not find any evidence that such volcanic outpouring would have the predicted effect on weather. As Wexler himself admits: “The records of weather stations around the world failed to show any consistent or significant cooling of the globe after the Krakatoa explosion or other great vol- canic eruptions.” He then blames this failure on the fact that there were not enough weather stations at the time for enough data to be gathered. Even at the time of his writing, in 1952, the number of weather stations remained insignificant with large areas of Earth, especially the oceans, devoid of such depots.? Decades later, ocean cores from the North Pacific, said to contain evidence of glaciation, were also found to contain ash. This led to the revival of the volcanic theory, which blamed the succession of ice ages commencing some 2.6 million years ago on a series of volcanic eruptions. Earlier still, some 25 million years ago, another eruption, or series of eruptions, deposited a thick layer of pumice which was discovered in the sediment below the sea ice of Antarctica. And yet, Wexler himself throws a monkey in the wrench of his own supposition when he focuses on the major problem of the theory in that “the geological record shows no consistent connection between periods of volcanic activity and ice ages.” While geologists have some- times found that glacial deposits do lie on top of volcanic ash, in most cases the signatures of ice ages fail to reveal any apparent evidence of volcanic activity. There are also many sig- nificant deposits of volcanic ash that are not burdened by the signatures of ice ages. As Wexler was forced to admit: “It would be foolish to argue that volcanic explosions are the sole cause of long-range climatic variations,” even though he still believed them to have been the main cause.* One other problem that supporters of this theory seem to overlook concerns the cause be- hind such world-wide volcanic activity which, if made to account for ice ages, would have multiple volcanoes erupting much more frequently than at present for relatively short periods of time, and then lie dormant, when not extinct, for longer periods, only to re-activate them- selves, time and again, in a concerted cyclic pattern through the ages. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>POLE SHIFTS AND TILTS</center></b></p>\n<p>1964 also saw the publication of a book by René Gallant which not only severely criti- cized the Milankovitch theory, but which also proposed a theory of ice ages which has been expounded on by various authorities through the years.
