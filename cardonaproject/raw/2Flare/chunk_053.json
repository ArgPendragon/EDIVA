This is expressly indicated by the Greeks among whom this festival was known as the Kronia, named after the planetary god in question. Among the later Romans, it was referred to as the Saturn- alia,? since the Roman god in question was Saturnus, from which the deity’s and the planet’s English name is obviously derived. Moreover, Nawroz, the Persian New Year, dedicated to Ahura Mazda, was the day on which the dead were believed to be raised.+ There is much more that could have been added here on this particular subject, but in view of the fact that we have various related topics that we have yet to cover, I must not tax the reader’s patience. Even so, taken with what we have presented in our previous volume, to say nothing of what will be disclosed in the following pages, the evidence enumerated above should add cogency to our postulate concerning the north celestial polar place- ment of the Saturnian sun. And it is this very locality of Earth’s primordial primary that will enable us to solve the various conundrums concerning Earth’s past ice ages that we discussed in the first part of this work. Not only that, but our postulate will also help us solve a few other problems that presently burden more than just one discipline.</p>",

There was a time when such a linear formation was actually believed to be outside the possibilities of astronomical bodies. But as Halton Arp, an iconoclast among astronomers, has indicated, linear formations in space are now believed to be quite common.! “It is a curious and exciting property of the universe,” he reported in 1987, “that a great deal of extragalactic matter appears to be arranged in linear formations.”? These linear configurations include galaxies which stretch across space “in chains.” As Arp disclosed, “chains and filaments of galaxies are very common features of the distribution of galaxies on the sky.”? In some cases, as much as “4 or more galaxies [are so] aligned.” Galaxies themselves, moreover, have a tendency to eject “condensations” which also re- main linearly aligned.&gt; These “condensations” occur in violent jets of plasma that erupt from the core of the galaxies in poleward directions.6 Such jets have been known since 1918, hav- ing come to light in a photograph originally published by Heber Curtis which showed a dis- tinctive luminous spike originating from the nucleus of Messier 87 (also known simply as M87, </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>NGC</center></b></p>\n<p>4486, and/or Virgo A). “It was like a fountain of material emerging from the center of the galaxy,” Arp himself described it. And it, too, displayed a series of “compact knots of material coming out along the jet like peas in a pea shooter.’ At first ignored by most astronomers, the phenomenon was not allotted the status of reality until the object was confirmed by radio astronomy as “a jet of radio emitting material.” Similar, but less powerful, jets are also expelled by individual stars. As in the case of galaxies, “condensations,” sometimes referred to as “knots,” which are astronomical bodies</p>",

As claimed in the prequel to this volume, this is incontestable proof that axially aligned linear formations are not only possible, but actually exist in space. They line up along plasma jets ejected poleward, sharing the same axis of rotation as their parent star, exactly as posited for Earth and Saturn in this study. More than that, as has already been shown,’ and as we will further indicate in the pages that follow, the Saturnian sun also emanated just such a “jet,” in the form of a sustained Birkeland current, in which Earth was imbedded much like the “condensations” noted above. Needless to say, galactic jets are colossal emanations that have been calculated to stretch for light years. Astral ones are much less immense, but still beyond the magnitude of our posited Saturn-Earth system. But if these jets can form in such widely different proportions, what is there to keep them from forming in even more modest dimensions? Anthony Peratt spelled it out quite clearly when he stated that discharge phenomena, which is what these cosmic jets amount to, are scalable.3 “The differences in scale...are completely unimportant,” Donald Scott explained. “They all work the same way.”* This is exemplified by the nature of comets, the tails of which are also now known to be composed of plasma.&gt; Like the twisted filaments of Birkeland currents, concerning which see more below, cometary plasma tails are also sometimes “twisty.” And, very much like galactic and astral jets, cometary tails also exhibit “knots,” described as “small condensations of matter brighter than their surroundings.” Thus, if plasma jets—which might be a misnomer, in any case—can span the spectrum from galactic to cometary size, what is there to keep them from forming in a stage between these limits?’ </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>PLASMA STREAMS AND BIRKELAND CURRENTS</center></b></p>\n<p>Plasma is what happens to a gas when heated to the point at which the atoms which com- pose it break apart through ionization. In other words, the electrons separate from the atoms, leaving behind the positively charged ions. Plasmas are therefore streams of separate posi- tively charged ions, negatively charged electrons, and neutral molecules. As such, a plasma is an excellent conductor of electricity.</p>",
