In 1998, Alan Boss suggested that “density fluctuations in the disks could form dense clumps that rapidly collapse into giant planets.” In a computer model of his own creation, however, the “dense clumps” tended to disperse. Tom Quinn then came to the rescue by re- fining “the struggle between competing forces in the disc”—that is, the struggle between gravity and the orbital speed of the “dense clumps.” According to Quinn, in the end gravity wins and, in a few hundred years, no less, “half a dozen Jupiter-sized bodies” would be formed.? However, if I may give vent to my ignorance, if there were but sparse particles in the outer reaches of the disk, gravity would have had little to play with. Besides all that, circumstellar disks, or, as they are sometimes miscalled, planetary nebu- lae, do not last all that long. In 2001, Robert O’Dell reported that: “Radiation evaporates away the disks in a few hundred thousand years or less,” leaving little or no time for planets to coalesce.? By the end of 2002, O’Dell’s “or less” seems to have won out. By then the consensus of opinion was that the disks “exist for only a few hundred to perhaps one thousand years —an astronomical blink of an eye.”* Given the above, the birth of planets by ejection from stars, which is gaining wider ac- ceptance by astronomers, seems all the more plausible. Moreover, quite a few members of this new breed agree that these ejections take place in opposite and aligned directions, usually axially, before being scattered to settle in equatorial planes.&gt; Wallace Thornhill was even bold enough to suggest that “small stars like proto-Saturn undergo variable behavior like large, brighter stars.” This, according to him, “may be caused by external changes in the electrical environment or by an internal build-up and sudden redistribution of charge.” As far as Earth is concerned, Thornhill could find no objection to its ejection by proto-Saturn in what he believed to be “a normal process for such bodies.”® Out in space, needless to say, there would have been no force to disrupt the axial coupling of proto-Saturn with Earth, which would have conserved its momentum of ejection. Proto-Saturn’s gravitational attraction, whether electrically induced or not, would not have allowed Earth to escape from its primary. Due to gravitation, ejected objects do tend to slow down.’ Knots in cosmic “jets,” which is what these plasma currents have been misnamed, are not always seen to travel down their extents.

The speed of similar, but much smaller, knots in the plasma tail of comets is also very erratic, with their acceleration “turning on and off capriciously.” Some cometary knots were seen to have “very little speed or acceleration.”? It cannot therefore be a law of plasma physics that bodies embedded in cosmic “jets” must travel on forever. In a system as compact as the proto-Saturnian one we are discussing, it is evident that, in the end, gravity will win out. Besides the “jet” of plasma that connected Earth to proto-Saturn, the system as a whole was also encased in its own plasmasphere, a plasmaspheric bubble of as yet undetermined size and shape. Such plasmaspheres are now known to be everywhere. Everything in the Universe seems to be encased in a plasmasphere. This includes our own galaxy, the Milky Way. “Star tracking,” writes Bob Berman, “reveals that our galaxy is immersed in a gigantic, near-invisible shell of matter like a ship in a bottle.”3 Calculated to extend outward at least 150,000 light years, this shell is presently believed to consist of dark matter, that theorized chimerical substance that continues to elude those who have been searching for it. This unde- tected dark matter is claimed to constitute 30 percent of the Universe. Its just as undetected kin, dark energy, is claimed to constitute the other 70 percent. I won’t quibble about the fact that the total of these percentages end up leaving no room for anything else in the Universe (which would make for absolute invisibility in any case). I merely point to that other claim that 99.9 percent of the Universe consists of plasma.&gt; At least this leaves something other than itself to account for what we see. More than that, unlike dark matter and dark energy, plasma is detectable. Forget dark matter. It is quite obvious that what has been encountered as a “near-invisible shell” around the Milky Way is its plasma envelope. The Sun, too, is encased in a plasmasphere, which is called the heliosphere.® In fact, the Sun’s heliosphere encases the entire Solar System.’ Its edge is presently believed to lie any- where between 2 and 10 billion miles from the Sun. Within this heliosphere, the giant planets are also encased in their own plasmaspheres. Jupiter, for instance, is now known to be sur- rounded by a magnetospheric bubble that has been calculated to be twenty times larger than the Sun.’ The remains of proto-Saturn’s plasmasphere continues to discharge to the present day in the form of a plasma doughnut which is known to surround the planet.? Venus pos- sesses a plasmasphere in the form of a cometary tail that spreads close enough to “tickle the</p>",

        "content": "<p>Earth when the two planets are in line with the Sun.”! At present, even Earth is embedded in its own plasma sheath, which astronomers have for years referred to as its magnetosphere.” Calculated to extend at least 12,000 miles into space, it has even been “photographed.”3 During the time with which we are concerned, Earth’s heat was derived solely from the proto-Saturnian sun. This heat would have radiated directly from proto-Saturn’s close prox- imity about Earth’s northern hemisphere. The southern latitudes would also have received sufficient warmth, even if a feebler light, from the radiation that would have been reflected off the inner surface of proto-Saturn’s plasmasphere within which Earth was enveloped. In the northern hemisphere, this indirect radiation would have added to the direct heat and light received from above Earth’s northern pole. Thus, for long periods of time, Earth’s climatic environment would have been one without seasonal change, luxuriating in one single season of eternal spring,* even if latitudinal temperatures would have varied slightly from one another. Tropical and/or sub-tropical flora and fauna were therefore able to thrive in Earth’s northern region, even within the present Arctic circle, and the possibility exists that this flora and fauna originated in these regions before migrating to more southerly latitudes. To early man, proto-Saturn would have been the only visible celestial body in Earth’s pri- mordial sky. Due to its axial coupling with Earth, it would have appeared to be permanently immobile in Earth’s north celestial pole. Out in space, the Sun was yet too far away to have been seen. The Moon had not yet been captured.5 Because of their apparent dimness, the stars, which should have peppered the sky, were shielded from view by the opacity of proto-Saturn’s plasmaspheric shell. At present, all plasmaspheres within the Solar System, as also the Sun’s heliosphere, are entirely transparent. Plasmaspheres, however, can be opaque, as proto-Saturn’s seems to have been. According to the plasma physicist Anthony Peratt, a “plasma cloud...indeed can vary between transparent and opaque at different wavelengths.”© With a sun that shone but dimly red that neither rose nor set, that neither waxed nor waned, ancient man had no means of telling the passage of time.” This was an era which an- cient man remembered as a timeless age during which the world was bathed in the dim perpetual light of a pre-dawn sky. It was in this milieu that Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons co-existed.</p>",
