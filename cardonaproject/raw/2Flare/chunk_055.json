As the Navajo say: “[In the beginning there] were no sun, no moon, no stars...”! This is repeated by the Yuma who also claim that, “when it all began,” there was “only nothingness.” As they say, “there were no sun, no moon, no stars— just darkness.”? So, similarly, with the Tsimshian who are fond of relating that: “In the beginning...there was only the chief in the sky...But there was no light in the sky—only emptiness and darkness.”3 The Zuni, too, tell the same thing: “At this time the world was still dark; the sun and moon had not yet been put in the sky.”4 And likewise among the Cherokee.5 Farther south, the Maya also related that, in the beginning, there was no light. All was darkness upon the primordial sea. They believed in “‘the lightless time before First Father raised the sky,’ before the appearance of the present Sun.” As told in the Popul Vuh, in the beginning, nothing was yet formed. “Whatever there is that might be,” it is there written, “is simply not there; only murmurs, ripples, in the dark, in the night.”8 This belief was so entrenched in the mind of the Mesoamericans that the Aztecs contin- ued to stress it in defense of their religion against the accusations of the Spanish Catholic priesthood, and continues to the present among the Nahua speakers in north and central Mexico.? According to a recorded speech of the Aztec priests, their prime deity, whom they referred to by a term that has been translated as “the Omneity,” had existed since the very beginning in “the eldest Darkness.”!° In South America, too, it was believed that, in the most ancient times, Earth was covered in darkness. There was no Sun. As in tales from the rest of the world, the Sun, Moon and the stars were created later.!! As recounted in the second chant of the Guarani’s Ayvu Rapyta, their creator, Namandu, also known as the First One, had originally existed alone “in the heart of the eldest darkness.”!? According to the Polynesian islanders of Nauru, at the dawn of creation there was dark- ness,!3 In a myth of the Aranda of Central Australia we hear that: “In the very beginning every- thing was resting in perpetual darkness: night oppressed everything like an impenetrable</p>",

It was because of this environmental condition, more than anything else, that , among the Polynesians, night was believed to mark the beginning of the world.? </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>THE HABITABLE ZONE</center></b></p>\n<p>Life on Earth, it has been said, is only possible because of its location—its distance from the Sun—within the Solar System. Known as the habitable zone, this locality encompasses a narrow orbital belt, which lacks a sharp boundary,? somewhere between the planets Venus and Mars. “Very simply, the habitable zone is defined as that region around a star where wa- ter—regarded by many as essential for life —exists in liquid form on the surface of a planet long enough to nurture the evolution of life.”4 Were we closer to Venus, it had once been posited, Earth and all its life-forms would have roasted; closer to Mars, and we would have frozen to death The above, however, has never really sat well with certain thinkers, among them Frederic Jueneman whose opinion is that “this business about Earth being in a relatively narrow life zone, at an optimal distance from our particular type star, where climate is balanced between two extremes, is chauvinistic, provincial, and probably nonsense.”6 To which he added: “Tt may be nonsense because it is assumed a priori that this is the way things are in the here and now, and therefore this is the way it was and the way it has to be. This kind of thinking is gradually being eroded away by more recent concepts about the possibilities of life on the outer gas giant planets and their satellites.”” Besides, as Mark Garlick noted: “The zone’s definition varies from time to time and may not contain strictly all pos- sible life-bearing worlds. For example, the jovian moon Europa is well outside the sun’s habitable zone and yet is regarded by many scientists as one of the two most likely places in the solar system (the other being Mars) where extraterrestrial life might exist.”8 Earth’s near-circular orbit was also once believed to be indispensable for life, since an elliptical or oval orbit would swing it too close to the Sun at one end, and too far at the</p>",
