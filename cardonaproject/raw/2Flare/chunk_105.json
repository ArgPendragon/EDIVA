Derdekeas there tells Shem: “And the star of the Light...is my invincible garment which I wore in Hades [that is, in dark- ness].”? There is, however, nothing peculiar about the metaphorical portrayal of light as the garment of the object that is seen to radiate it. The most developed and widespread of Gnostic ideologies was that of the Manichaeans which was founded by, and named after, its founder Mani. Born in Babylonia in about A.D. 216, Mani was a teacher, and also something of an artist, in the Persian kingdom of Shapur I (A.D. 241-272). Having come in conflict with the Zoroastrian Magi under the following reign of Bahram I (A.D. 274-277), he was arrested and placed in chains. The accounts of his death are contradictory. Some documents reported that he died in prison, others that he was crucified, still others that he was flayed alive, and one more reports that he was decapitated with his head set high on the city gate. Mani taught that Zoroaster, Jesus, and Buddha were his forerunners and that he was sim- ply continuing, while perfecting, their doctrine. His own mission, he declared, was to lead humanity from its abject servitude to the “King of Light.” Having authored various book- length works,&gt; most of them were destroyed and, today, exist only as fragments and partial quotations by other writers. According to Mani, the leader of the realm of light, whom he referred to as the King of Light and the Father of Light, is located in the north,<em> the very locality from which the Sat- urnian sun had shed its radiance. Moreover, in the Iranian texts, this Father of Light is named Zurvan</em> who, as is well known, was the Iranian name for Saturn.® It can thus be additionally seen that the light of Genesis was of great eminence among those of the Judeo-Christian faith. This became so much so that, to use the words employed by C. H. Dodd, light became the “natural symbol for deity.” In time, as I intend to show in future volumes of this series, the shining of such light was associated by those of a religious mind with the birth of various heroes, kings, and prophets. Nor did the religious fixation with this primordial light remain an obsession of the past. Those Jews who remain faithful to the teachings of the Kabbalah not only believe that the light of Genesis can be physically repro- duced, but they “work” toward its eventual reappearance.</p>",

        "content": "<p>“Kabbalah is explicitly esoteric [Martin Bernal noted]. It rejects both the historicism of the common ‘superficial’ reading of the Bible and the rationality of orthodoxy in favor of an ‘inner’ reading of the text which is supposed to reveal a mystic cosmic struggle for the good Jews to reconstitute the primeval light shattered at the moment of creation.”! </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>THE TERRIFYING SPLENDOR</center></b></p>\n<p>Zurvan notwithstanding, the paucity of Saturnian associations in the Gnostic documents which, after all, are somewhat late as sources go, is more than compensated for by the earliest extant texts at our disposal. True enough, in one of the, if not the, earliest of these— the convoluted account of Creation contained in the Babylonian Enuma Elish—the shedding of the light is missing. This, however, is due to a break of some twenty lines in the cuneiform tablet that would have contained this event. On the other hand, newer fragments indicate that Apsu, the primordial celestial ocean, and Tiamat, its feminine counterpart,? bewailed the creation of the light. More than that, in a religio-philosophical allegory worthy of the later Hindus, Apsu and Tiamat are said to have planned the changing of the light back into darkness. “Let the light be darkened,” it is there written, “like night may it be.”3 That they failed need not be told. Leaving the Enuma Elish aside, we turn to the well known Mesopotamian deities identifiable as Saturn. Among these, the one known as Anu was described as having shone with a “terrifying splendor,”+ which is hardly descriptive of the present state of the planet Saturn. Nor is Anu the only Saturnian deity from Mesopotamia who was said to have radiated brilliantly. It was likewise with Ninurta, one of whose epithets had originally been translated to mean “King, Storm whose brilliance surpassed (all others)”&gt; or “King, Storm, whose splendor is Heroic.” Through the corrections introduced by Sjoberg and Bergmann,” however, the epithet actually translates as “King, Light whose brilliance surpassed (all others —i.e. all other gods).”8 Formerly rendered by earlier mythologists as Ninib, Ninurta was also lauded as “he who, like the sun, the light of the gods, irradiates the nations.”® Ninurta also bore the bona fide alias of Ningirsu!°—the Lord of Girsu (in Lagash).!!

        "content": "<p>Ningirsu is said to have come forth in overwhelming splendor.' “In the land,” it is there written, “it became day.”? As it was also said of him : “he changes darkness into light.”3 Another radiating Babylonian god was Bel. Like the Canaanite Ba’al, Bel was more of a title, meaning “Lord,” than an actual name. That the Babylonian Bel is to be identified as yet one more personification of Saturn was intuited by Stephen Langdon who recognized in him the Greek Cronos (the same as Kronos), whom he unfortunately misidentified as the setting or autumn Sun.* Nor need we rely on Langdon’s intuition for this identification since Servius confirmed that the god called Bel by the Assyrians represented both the Sun and the planet Saturn.&gt; The reason behind the confusion between Saturn and the Sun among modern, as well as ancient, writers on mythology should by now be more than evident. Thus, as Langdon him- self informs us, a marble altar from Palmyra, dedicated by Tiberius Claudius Felix to Malak Bel—King Bel or the Lord King—shows the god in question as Sol sanctissimus (or sanc- tissimo), that is the “most Sacred Sol.”6 That the name Sol was applied to the planet Saturn before it became the Latin designation for the present Sun need not be repeated here.” Some of the above was used in our previous volume as evidence for the former sun-like quality of what is now the planet Saturn.’ It must however be understood that it was precisely from this moment on—that is, from the moment proto-Saturn flared up—that it began to radi- ate as a virtual sun. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>THE BIRTH OF RA</center></b></p>\n<p>Among the ancient Egyptians, proto-Saturn’s flare-up was remembered as the birth of Ra.

According to the Pert em Hru, this watery abyss, this Nu, flooded Ra “with his rays of light.”!3 Normally it would seem rather strange for an expanse of water to radiate light. It does not, however, appear that strange when we remember that this watery abyss, this Nu, was the manner in which the</p>",
