But is it a coincidence that the oldest discovered Negro and Pygmy skeletal remains happen to be dated to our benchmark figure of 10,000 years ago? To be sure, evidence of a greater antiquity for the Ituri Forest Pygmies has been based “on the discovery of stone implements, the oldest of which are dated to about 20,000 years ago.”3 This, however, tells us nothing about the stature of the people who used these im- plements, even if they were the ancestors of the Ituri Pygmies. Am I claiming that the African Negroes and Pygmies originated as the result of sudden mutation incurred through proto-Saturn’s flare-up? Let me just say that the hypothesis is worthy of consideration. Actually, however, race is more a case of genetic recombination than outright genetic mutation. But, in our case, this will be found to make little difference. In the meantime let no one suppose that the Pygmies and Negroes of Africa, together with their North American descendants, are mentally, or otherwise, inferior to any other race. In the end, regardless of race, we are all descended from mutants. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>BURPING METHANE</center></b></p>\n<p>In the search for the most viable theory of past extinctions, Gregory Ryskin has recently come up with a new hypothesis. As summarized by Susan Kruglinski: “Ryskin proposes that huge deposits of methane and other gases, which are naturally produced in deep-sea waters, became trapped under the pressure of a then-stagnant global ocean. Any forceful disturbance—an earthquake or a volcanic eruption, for instance—could have disrupted the pressurized gas. Rising methane could have churned the ocean, suffocating aquatic organisms, and flooded into the atmosphere, triggering a worldwide hot spell. A single lightning stroke could even have set the whole planet aflame.”+ Ryskin meant this scenario to apply to the great extinction of the Permian which “wiped out virtually all marine species and most life on land.” Gregory Retallack, on the other hand, thought this explanation rather dubious because he couldn’t see how that much methane could be stored underwater. But, as Ryskin pointed out, “minor gas belches still create hazards in lakes and coastal areas.” Moreover, the same thing, if on a somewhat smaller scale than that envisaged by Ryskin, was later found to have transpired at the end of the Pleistocene. But where does oceanic methane came from? It has now been ascertained that “nearly a third of all the life on this planet consists of mi- crobes living under the seafloor in a dark world without oxygen.”5 What was originally thought to be mud hoisted from the bottom of the Black Sea in the summer of 2001 turned</p>",

About one ton of biological material was hauled up and it turned out to be “a cubic meter of bacteria.” Diving into the area a few days later in the German submarine Jago revealed curtains of rising bubbles through a flood-lit fog of floating particles. Nor were these bubbles being released through hot vents. They came, instead, from non-volcanic chimneys that were as soft as flesh. Knocking one over by one of the submarine’s hydraulic arms, it was discovered that the chimney had been constructed by single-celled microbes. “The microbes formed the outer layers; the hard core was a carbonate mineral they had secreted.”! It is these microbes which are now known to manufacture methane. “The evidence is now clear that far below the sea, and far below the floor of the sea, in sediments all over the world, microbes live to astonishing depths...and in aston- ishing numbers. The deepest of the microbes make methane, which the ones in shal- lower sediments consume. To all of them, oxygen is poison.” The total amount of methane produced by these organisms has been estimated to be “greater than the mass of all known reserves of coal, gas, and oil.” Moreover, methane is a potent greenhouse gas. It has even been theorized that the release of this microbial methane may have aided in pulling Earth out of recent ice ages by radically changing the climate. More than that, sudden blasts of this methane have been linked to undersea landslides that would have caused ocean-crossing tsunamis and even mass extinctions. The scar left behind by one these massive landslides occurs off the coast of Norway in the form of a 1,000-foot high cliff at the edge of the continental shelf. The floor of the ocean at this point has been dated to have dropped about 8,200 years ago. The landslide that caused it “was one of the greatest in Earth’s history.”4 The magnitude of this slide was reported by Kunzig on the authority of Jiirgen Mienert: “Blocks of mud perhaps 20 miles long, a couple of miles wide, and 150 feet high rushed down the slope. More than 1,000 cubic miles of sediment and rock shifted. The slide ran out 500 miles to the northwest, north of Iceland, where it met the Mid- Atlantic Ridge and was diverted south. Over an area of 35,000 square miles, the whole ocean was as muddy as the Mississippi after a storm, and the seafloor was wiped clean of whatever lived there.”’&gt; Moreover, as Mienert has deduced, the slide occurred “in a very short time...perhaps in a few weeks, perhaps a few days, perhaps a couple of hours.”6 “The disturbance propagated a tsunami that flooded coastal areas as far away as Scotland. Along the coasts of Scotland and Norway, the wave ranged between 20</p>",

As Kunzig cautions: “To say that the cataclysm was caused by deep-living microbes would be excessive —but their methane may have had a lot to do with it.” There are cracks in the seafloor about 3 miles wide and 50 feet deep just north of the slide. They are dotted with what Mienert calls pockmarks. And that is where the methane escaped. Mienert himself blames all of this on the melting of the Pleistocene ice when Atlantic water flowed in and warmed the bottom.? But, in our own scenario, it is just as probable that the slide—and vari- ous others around the world which have not yet been recognized —were caused by the tempo- rary slowing down of Earth’s rotation due to proto-Saturn’s flare-up. Such sea bottom cracks and pockmarks have also been discovered at the edge of the continental shelf near Cape Hat- teras. In fact, pockmarks “are turning out to be extremely common, especially in the Arctic” and Mienert “has seen fields of them in the Barents Sea.”? That these pockmarks could not be extremely old is evidenced by the fact that they have not yet been filled by sediment washing down to the sea from inland rivers. Thus, as Kunzig rightly surmises, these pockmarks “date from the last ice age.” The only problem with all this is that, as surmised by the marine geologist James Kennett, bursts of methane from the seafloor would have been largely responsible for “virtually all the warmings the planet has experienced over the last 800,000 years.”4 As always, once a cause is found to account for an event, it tends to end up being the event’s one and only explanation in the minds of those involved with that particular theory. Not only that, but, as always with any new theory, this one, too, found its detractors. Thus Gerald Dickens was of the opinion that the chances of deep-sea methane actually making it to the surface is zero. But blocks of hydrate floating on the surface as well as gas bubbles rising to the top have been witnessed off the coast of Oregon and the Gulf of Mexico. Even so, Dickens continued to claim that “no one has shown that quantities of methane large enough to change the climate would reach the atmosphere.”&gt; Our own stand, of course, is somewhere in between. No, we do not accept that the escape of oceanic bacterial methane would have been enough to change the climate or cause extinctions at the end of the Pleistocene. But, coupled with all that we have enumerated and described above, it would, if nothing else, have added to the sudden steep incline in temperature. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>HEAVEN ON EARTH</center></b></p>\n<p>We end this part of our work on the same subject with which we started, namely, the heat wave that followed on the heels of proto-Saturn’s flare-up.
