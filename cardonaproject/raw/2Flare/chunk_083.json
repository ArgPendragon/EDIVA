Is this not, in fact, borne out by the Linga Purana itself in which Shiva is also called Sarvadevamaya (name #893 and #949), which means “identical with all Devas,” and Sarvalakshana (name #866), “one who has all characteristics”? In reality, rather than being the same as Karttikeya/Mars, Shiva was actually his father.2 But then, again, how can we be sure that Shiva’s identity as Saturn does not stem from the same cause. Preference for a Saturnian identification of Shiva originates in those epithets which, with- out calling on Saturn itself or any other celestial body, compare favorably with the universal characteristics of the mythological Saturnian sun. Among the “thousand and eight” names of Shiva, these epithets proliferate. This indicates that Shiva’s identity as Saturn predominates In clarifying this very problem, Roger Ashton had recourse to a different, but just as valid, argument: “In the instances of Kala, Raivata, Sthira, and Yama [which are all epithets of Shiva], no planet other than Saturn is mentioned. It could [therefore] be assumed that the original linkage is shown by this one class of clues rather than by several others. Given this, Shiva’s real link is to Saturn, while others are misleading.”+ This is especially apparent in the feast of Shani-Pradosh, celebrated by the Hindus when the thirteenth day of a lunar fortnight falls on a Saturday. As is well know, Saturday is named in honor of the Saturnian deity, the name being derived from the Saxon Saterne’s Day (or Daeg), through the Latin Saturni Dies. The day of Saturday was held sacred to Saturn among the peoples of various other nations, including the Jews, Arabs, Maltese, the Latins, and Indo-Chinese.5 And so, also, among the Hindus, whose name for Saturday is Shanivar, derived from Shani, which is probably the most common Sanskrit name of the planet Saturn. Shanivar thus translates as “Saturn’s Day.”® Now on the night of Shani-Pradosh there occurs a worship of no other than Shiva. Pradosh means “night.” Shani-Pradosh thus translates as “Saturn’s Night.” It is not reasonable to assume that a deity honored in a festival called Saturn’s Night, occurring in the evening of Saturn’s Day, is not himself a personification of the same Saturn. Otherwise this would be akin to claiming that the Christian feast of Christmas is not held in honor of Christ. Besides which, Shani, the name of the planet Saturn, is yet one more epithet of Shiva.”</p>",

We have also already noted Shiva’s epithet of Sthanu, which has the meaning of “pillar” or “post.” Kilah, yet another name of Shiva, likewise means “pillar.”! But Shiva was also designated as Ekapada, which means “lame.”? As Aja Ekapad, however, he is the “one- footed” support of the sky.? That this lameness was attributable to the Saturnian planetary god is evidenced in a myth in which Shani, that is the planet Saturn, was lamed by Parvati for having killed her son. And yet, in a different version of the myth, it was Shiva who molested Parvati’s son.4 Besides his lameness, as an ascetic Shiva is also portrayed as standing on his right leg, with his left being held by a strap which he holds in his right arm.5 To this day, Shivaites and Sadhus still adopt this posture and hold it for long periods of time as a form of devotion to their god.° It is doubtful that they know it, but in adopting this stance they are actually imi- tating the one-legged posture of the primordial Saturnian sun. In order not to portray the deity in his deformity, Shiva is also sometimes depicted sitting with one leg tucked under or in front of him, with the other dangling straight below.” The leg, or foot, that is the cosmic pillar, is also commemorated in the Hindu ritual involving the raising of the sacred stake known as the Yupa. As this stake is raised, the priest intones the words: “With thy crest thou hast touched the sky; with thy middle thou hast filled the air; with thy foot thou has steadied the earth.”8 It is, however, the ancients’ rendition of this pillar of light as the god’s phallus that will retain our interest for the remainder of this chapter since, as we shall soon see, it will become of special importance in the unfolding of the events that brought the Ice Age to an end. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>THE MAHA LINGA</center></b></p>\n<p>As we have shown in our previous volume, “the downward flow of light from above,”? was visualized by some as a cosmic phallus.'° In Egypt, Osiris was considered the phallus of the same Ra.

Others, however, say that his name is Ra, and that the god who dwelleth in Amentet [that is, Osiris] is the phallus of Ra, wherewith he had union with him- self.”! At this point, the slight ambiguity in the above liturgy as to whether Osiris and Ra were one and the same deity, or whether one was considered merely a particular feature belonging to the other, should not surprise the reader. But besides being the phallus of Ra, Osiris was also believed to have boasted of his own. In fact, Osiris’ member seems to have been so popular with the Egyptian population that the Greek biographer, Plutarch, could assert that the god “was everywhere represented with the phallus exposed.” The deity known as Aai is presented as a phallus god,? but, at the same time, Aai is also one of the forms of Ra.* Similarly, Rehu is a god identified with the phallus of Osiris,&gt; but Rehu is also a form of Shu,° whom we had also earlier presented as the heaven-sustaining deity.7 In Indic lore, it is Shiva who is mainly connected with the phallus, known there as the linga or lingam. Shiva is not, however, the only deity associated with the heavenly phallus. One of the meanings of the name Prajapati, the Creator, translates as the male organ of gen- eration.’ That Prajapati is also to be equated with Saturn we have indicated in our previous volume.” Among most mythologists, the lingam is usually represented as a symbol of fertility, as is apparent in the writings of Veronica Ions. In speaking of the Dravidians, the non-Aryan peoples of southern India and Ceylon, Ions presented them as an agricultural people who “worshipped gods connected in one way or another with fertility.” Typical of this, according to her, was phallic worship at Harappa.!0 Elsewhere she speaks of the “fertility-giving aspect of Shiva,” whose “supreme creative power is celebrated in the worship of the lingam or phallus,”!! which personal attribute “characterise[s] Shiva as a god of fertility.”!? De Wilman-Grabowska also presents Shiva as a “God of fecundity” being worshipped “in the shape of the linga.”!3 Mircea Eliade, on the other hand, was somewhat more inclusive when he stated that: “It is very likely that among those who adore the lingam of Siva, a great many see it only as an archetype of the generative organ; but there are others who look to it as a</p>",
