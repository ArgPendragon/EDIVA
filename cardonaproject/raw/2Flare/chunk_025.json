        "content": "<p>Let us first return to Earth’s geomagnetic reversals which Warlow attributed to Earth’s inversion. As Trevor Palmer correctly proclaimed, “the sheer frequency of geomagnetic re- versals would seem to rule this out as a general mechanism.”! So, also, Peter James and Nick Thorpe who rightfully proclaimed that: “Geologists believe that there have been some 120 geomagnetic reversals since the age of the dinosaurs, 65 million years ago. If Warlow’s explanation of such events is correct, then the Earth would have to have been toppled over so many times by close encounters with Jupiter-size bodies. One such encounter seems improbable enough, so the idea that there were as many as 120 seems vanishingly small, even given the huge time scale involved.”? Besides, the Sun, too, is known to reverse its magnetic field during each eleven-year cycle} but it does so without inverting itself. Besides, the reversing of Earth’s geomagnetic field is not tied to the cycle of ice ages anymore than it is tied to mass extinctions,* another fallacious correlation favored by catas- trophists. This is indicated by the fact that various magnetic reversals fail to coincide with the dates of past ice ages, and by the additional fact that there are more recorded magnetic reversals than there are ice ages. That one particular reversal, known as the Gothenburg flip, happens to coincide roughly with the Pleistocene epoch, as noted by D. S. Allan and J. B. Delair,&gt; whom we shall meet again later, does not tie magnetic reversals to ice ages. On the other hand, even if Earth’s reversing field cannot be coupled to terrestrial inversions, of itself it does not invalidate the possibility of a tippe-top-like inversion. That planets can tip over due to external forces is actually admitted by mainstream as- tronomers. As Warlow himself and his supporters have pointed out, this is the manner in which the planet Uranus is believed to have been tilted. As proposed in 1966 by the Soviet scientist V. S. Safronov, Uranus was flipped on its side to its present 98 degree-tilt by the di- rect impact of a sizeable body during the planet’s coagulative period.® But this, again, had been a one-time event. Worse than that, with Earth of a much less massive size than Uranus, a direct hit by an impactor massive enough to cause a complete terrestrial inversion would have probably resulted in detrimental consequences much more severe than either Ve- likovsky or Warlow envisioned. Besides, as Warlow himself admits, a terrestrial inversion is not necessary for the relocation of Earth’s polar caps, where a mere twenty or thirty degree tilt would be sufficient. Posited terrestrial axial shifts have not remained outside the domain of science and, by the turn of the century, such theories were still being aired. Thus, in a study of underwater</p>",

        "content": "<p>volcanoes, scientists came upon evidence which drew them to conclude that “Earth may have wobbled like an out-of-balance ball...relocating the poles and shifting the planet’s surface.” As William Sager, then hailing from Texas A&amp;M University, reported: “What it appears that happened, was a rapid shift” followed by a “slow recovery to where things are today.”! This event, however, was dated to 84 million years ago.2 No mechanism for Earth’s wobbling was forwarded. And no such correlation was discovered to account for the Pleisto- cene glaciation. And then, even if such wobbling was to be theorized as having been trig- gered by the close encounter with a planet-sized body of multi-Jupiter mass, one still has to ponder the probability of this having occurred time and again to account for nineteen separate ice ages, or nineteen separate relocations of the terrestrial polar caps. It does boggle the imagination. This is why, together with other reasons which we need not go into here, I had formerly suggested that the cause of Earth’s inversion(s), whether in a tippe-top fashion or not, should be sought in other means that the close fly-bys of planets?—and that alone should have told Warlow that I do not subscribe to Velikovsky’s scenario. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>WATER VERSUS ICE</center></b></p>\n<p>When it comes to glacial signatures in general, Velikovsky was of the belief that most of these were caused by surging floods of water. Prominent among these signatures are the er- ratic boulders which are found littering immense areas of Earth’s northern regions. These are rocks which can vary in size from boulders to village-size slabs weighing several tons that have been torn from one locality and transported to be deposited miles away in another. Er- ratic boulders are recognizable through their mineral composition which is different from that of the formation upon which they are discovered. In almost all cases, their mineral composi- tion can inform the geologist from which locality they had been dislodged. Originally be- lieved to have been torn and transported by immense waves of translation, these erratics were eventually recognized as having been dislodged and transported by the ice age glaciers. Ve- likovsky, however, believed that the original assessment had been the correct one and con- tinued to believe that these boulders had indeed been transported by the recurrent floods trig- gered by his series of cosmic catastrophes.+ Moraines, also known as drift and/or till, consist of conglomerates of similar, but smaller boulders and other rock fragments mixed with sand and clay which glaciers are known to push to the sides and in front of them. When the glaciers melt, the moraines are left in place as evidence of a once-advancing ice sheet. The ones pushed to the front remain in the form of irregular arcs as termination marks, and are therefore known as terminal moraines. Following the 1845 disclosures of R. I. Murchison, Velikovsky was of the belief that this detritus, too, was left behind by the same, or similar, surging floods of water, probably from irrupting seas triggered by one of his brand of cosmic catastrophes.&gt;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Seeing as these and similar arguments have more recently been reiterated with stronger arguments by D. S. Allan and J. B. Delair, we shall concentrate on their efforts since any ob- jections to their work would apply just as equally to Velikovsky’s. We stress this here be- cause, unlike Velikovsky, Allan and Delair were working within the confines of their own disciplines since the former is a science historian specializing in paleogeography and the lat- ter a geologist. While, normally, we would not care from what source our data is collated, giving greater weight to the strength of evidence than to whomsoever stands behind it, others may find the objections voiced by scholars within their own disciplines of greater validity than those voiced by scholars, like Velikovsky, outside their own fields. Even so, it must not be assumed that the theory as propounded by Allan and Delair has been accepted by ortho- dox paleogeographers and/or geologists. In the main, they are as iconoclastic as Velikovsky himself— in fact, as we shall soon see, perhaps even more so. Right off the bat, in the “Introduction” to their work, Allan and Delair proclaim that: “On the whole, it is sensible to support or retain a theory only if it ‘works’, provided that, in drawing diverse fragments of knowledge into defensible patterns, it enables useful predictions to be made about the shape of further discoveries. Conventional glacial theory, however, fails to meet this criterion.”! They then ask: “Did ice in another guise cause the supposed glacial phenomena, distrib- ute the ‘drift’ and disperse the ‘erratics’?”? Their answer to this question is that “something other than ice, operating in a worldwide capacity, was responsible for the deposition of ‘drift’ and the creation of other supposedly Ice Age phenomena.” As they themselves proclaim, Allan and Delair no not disavow the occurrence of the Pleistocene Ice Age. Like the present writer, they point to the shaky ground upon which the glacial theory has been reconstructed. To which they add: “That is not to assert that the Ice Age did not exist, but does indicate that it occurred in a form and by a means not properly accommodated by conventional dogma.4 With this we wholeheartedly agree. But also, as in Velikovsky’s case, most of the signatures attributed to the Pleistocene gla- ciation are, by Allan and Delair, blamed on the surging waters of immense floods. Like Ve- likovsky, they claim that terrestrial upheavals—earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, etcetera—occurred simultaneously with these floods. And, like Velikovsky before them, they attribute all these events to a cosmic catastrophe. But here is where they part company with Velikovsky and, to be sure, also with Peter Warlow who followed him, since they offered an entirely different cosmic cause. Even so, although the actual scenario of this postulated cos- mic catastrophe does not concern us here, it does bear a superficial resemblance to that pro- posed by Velikovsky and even to that of Donald Patten. In short, according to Allan and De-</p>",
