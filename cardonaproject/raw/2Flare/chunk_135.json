Such floods would have taken place regardless of whichever Ice Age theory is correct. Even those who have favored catastrophic flooding to the exclusion of ice ages might have interpreted some of Earth’s tortured signs correctly. Boulders could have thus been moved from their places of origin by catastrophic floods to be deposited miles away. Rock- laden currents could have scoured the land over which they overflowed. What will not do is to attribute all such signs to raging floods. Water from the melting ice would at first have drained down slopes to gather in streams and rivulets along meandering valleys. This water would also have been augmented by the torrential rains that would have precipitated from above. In fact, torrential rains, it has been theorized, had been falling even during the glacial epoch. As Robert Silverberg concluded: “During the glacial epochs, such regions as Africa, South America, central Asia, and the southern United States experienced ‘pluvial’ periods...During these prolonged rainy spells, lakes and rivers grew, basins now dry filled with water.”! If such heavy rains fell during the Ice Age, even more torrential ones would have precipi- tated once Earth’s atmosphere heated due to proto-Saturn’s Sun-induced flare-up. And this, in fact, was told by Philo as having occurred right after the flare-up which he described as the air bursting into light: “And when the air burst into light, both the sea and the land became heated, and thence arose winds and clouds, and very great downpours and floods of the waters of heaven.”? This, then, would have increased the amount of water draining through the valleys which would have swelled to violent proportions. Where rivers already existed, the amplified tor- rents would have burst their bounds, rising above their banks, inundating higher ground. We all know what a day’s heavy rainfall, especially thunderstorms, can accomplish not only in river-bound communities, but even in lowland areas far from any rivers. Describing the amount of greater flooding that must have ensued with the melting of the glaciers 10,000 years-or-so ago will be difficult, but, inadequate as they must necessarily be, the few selec- tions enumerated below will supply some idea. Because the melting of the ice would have been anything but uniform, lakes were created where channels were still blocked by ice. These ice barriers, however, would not have lasted</p>",

One of these ice-blocked lakes is known to have emptied itself in the present state of Washington. “One of the largest floods known on Earth [Michael Carr describes] is one crossing the eastern half of the state of Washington 10,000 or 20,000 years ago. The flood is thought to have resulted from rapid emptying of a lake that covered much of western Montana. The lake was dammed by ice, and the flood followed when the ice col- lapsed. The released water swept over eastern Washington, eroding deep channels, scouring wide swaths of ground, and carving teardrop-shaped islands...Discharge of about one hundred times that of the Amazon River persisted for several days.”! The glacial dam in question consisted of the Cordilleran ice sheet which extended south- ward and blocked the outlet that is now the Clark Fork River near present-day Sandpoint, in Idaho. To the east of this barricade stood Glacial Lake Missoula with an estimated depth of 1,950 feet covering an area of some 30,000 square miles. The inundation, known as the Spo- kane Flood,? which was caused by the rapture of the ice dam at Sandpoint has been estimated to have run at something like 388 million cubic feet per second. Despite the uncertainty indi- cated by Carr’s “10,000 or 20,000” year span, the time of the inundation has been firmly dated to the late Pleistocene.3 To be sure, Warren Hunt has contested that an ice dam could have held back the water of this lake, the depth of which was given by him as 2,100 feet. This, however, would depend on the thickness of the ice, that is how far it stretched behind the lake. Nevertheless, Hunt claims that the flood of water that scoured this stretch of land would have to have come from a tidal wave that swept over North America from the ocean. This tide, still according to him, would have inundated the Athabasca Valley up to about 5,000 feet above sea level. Hunt, of course, ascribes this tidal wave to a passing celestial body, which is not that far removed from our own hypothesis.4 However, if he is right in that this flood owes its origin to a tidal wave, in our scheme that tidal wave would have been spawned by the slowing down of Earth. We will leave it to future scholars to resolve the difference of opinion concerning the actual nature of this flood since, to us, it matters little since both theories agree in attributing the catastrophic flood in question to the end of the Ice Age. Five hundred and thirty-five miles away from the scars of this major catastrophe lies the well-known Great Salt Lake, in Utah. Lying in what is known as the Great Salt Lake Basin, this lake consists of the remains of a much larger sheet of water which has been named Lake Bonneville which, at one time, covered an area of 19,000 square miles compared to the pre- sent 1,500 square mile area. Ancient shorelines indicate a previous depth of 1,000 feet,</p>",

A sudden breaching of the shoreline at Red Rock Canyon at the north-east end of the lake emptied it of its water in a catastrophic flood that dug a 330-foot deep canyon with a width of over a mile. The water that poured through the breach spilled out on the Snake River Plain, and savagely attacked the deep lava forma- tions that form that plain, indicating that the melting of the ice followed the intense volcanic eruptions of the area. New spillways and channels, some of which were up to 1,000 feet wide and 330 feet deep, were cut into the lava for up to 18 miles. And this event, too, has been dated to the end of the Pleistocene.' Back in 1923, Harlan Bretz had gone even further in ascribing the entire scablands of Eastern Washington and the elongated basins, known as coulees, of the entire area to the same glacial floods. “Fully 3,000 square miles of the Columbia plateau were swept by the glacial flood, and the loess and silt cover removed. More than 2,000 square miles of this area were left as bare, eroded, rock cut channel floors, now the scablands, and nearly 1,000 square miles carry gravel deposits derived from the eroded basalt.”? “Bretz’s hypothesis evoked from the geological establishment a flood of commentary, nearly all of it negative,” Stephen Gould reported. But, as he goes on to say: “The common theme running through all of this criticism was the rejection of his ideas in favor of gradualis- tic explanations, often on a priori grounds.” Similarly with Lake Agassiz, in western Canada. This lake has been considered to have been the largest glacial lake in all of North America. It once covered a region much vaster than that which is presently covered by the continent’s five Great Lakes. It, too, was drained when the ice damming it gave way. The flood released by the lake surged in at least three di- rections, north, west, and south, disrupting sea currents even in the Arctic Ocean.4 The shore- line of this extinct lake, as Warren Upham realized, is not horizontal,&gt; which, again, speaks for a catastrophic disturbance of the land. Similar floods in northern Canada created those geological features known as drumlins, shallow streamlined, tear-drop shaped, islands left behind as the flood waters cut through the surrounding drift at the end of the same Ice Age.® Others have attributed these drumlins to the sculpturing nature of the moving glaciers, but, as John Shaw demonstrated, the stratified nature of these formations, to say nothing of the lack of other ice-related forms in their</p>",
