Instead as on the land, the response of the North Atlantic Ocean atmosphere system increasingly looks like a series of abrupt flip-flops from one stage to another.”! </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>SUMMING UP</center></b></p>\n<p>Much more can be said, as it has been said, for and against the Milankovitch theory, but at its heart lie the following problems: (1) There seems to be solid evidence that ice ages ended abruptly “with temperatures rising to their warmest levels even more rapidly than the ice sheets melted.” During the glacial periods “the temperature has also fluctuated rapidly and dramatically.” The problem here is that the orbital cycles inherent in the Milankovitch theory do not pro- vide “for such bursts of climatic change.”? (2) It has never been understood how the cooling of the northern hemisphere could ac- count for the accompanying glaciation of the southern one. “Glaciers in the Andes and Antarctica have advanced at roughly the same times as those in the north, that is, at times when the orbital calculations [inherent in the Milankovitch theory] indicate that the Southern Hemisphere should have been getting a lot of summer sunlight.”3 (3) The extent to which the shape of Earth’s orbit fluctuates varies with a period of about 10,000 years. This seems to fit the cycle of recurring ice ages which have also been calculated to occur every 10,000 years. And it is this, more than anything else, which has made the Milankovitch theory so seductive. Unfortunately, as already noted, that variation in Earth’s orbit only changes the amount of sunlight that reaches the north- ern hemisphere “by less than half a percent.” “Tn contrast, the shorter tilt and wobble cycles change the amount of Northern Hemi- sphere summer sunlight by as much as 20 percent. The question researchers have asked ever since the Milankovitch theory came back into vogue is: Why should the weakest orbital cause have the strongest geologic effect?’”’&gt; (4) But even the variation of Earth’s tilt is problematic in this respect. As Hoyle noted, “slight changes in the tilt of the Earth’s axis of spin give only negligible solar varia- tions at equatorial latitudes; yet the last ice age produced the great glaciers on Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and Mount Elgon in Uganda. Obviously something drastic happened in the tropics for which the Milankovitch theory cannot account.”6</p>",

        "content": "<p>Despite his own criticisms of the Milankovitch theory, Rose did have a few good things to say about it back in 1984. “It is regrettable,” he wrote, “that more recent defenders of the Milankovitch theory have abandoned much of the tentativeness and caution that were exhib- ited by Milankovitch himself.”! Rose even warned catastrophists, of whom he is one himself, not to relinquish the theory altogether. “It is even more regrettable,” he thus continued, “that catastrophists have hitherto shunned the theory, apparently on the grounds that it is somehow tainted because it has been used in defense of uniformitarianism.”? As he continues: “Tn its most general sense, the Milankovitch theory is concerned with the patterns of insolation during various orbital circumstances, and the effects that that insolation would have on climate, especially in terms of glaciation. When viewed in this way, the Milankovitch theory does not have to be uniformitarian at all.” However, the Milankovitch theory, as formulated by Milankovitch, is uniformitarian, and this is a fact that Rose was not only aware of, but one he himself stressed. Milankovitch’s approach was “to assume that the present orbit has been in place for an indefinitely long time, and that minor cyclical and secular changes of various sorts can be retrocalculated into the past.” If we then remove these factors from the Milankovitch theory, it is no longer the Milankovitch theory, and all that Rose can claim is that the ice ages can be attributed to an astronomical cause. I agree. But no matter how much Rose may argue, that astronomical cause cannot be the one advocated by Milankovitch. As of this writing, and despite the many objections brought against it, the Milankovitch theory still has its adherents. More than that, the theory is even now made to account for ef- fects other than ice ages. Thus, Martin Claussen, together with his graduate student Claudia Kubatzki, have now used the Milankovitch model to account for hotter northern summers, stronger monsoons, and a greener Sahara Desert. But that is another story.</p>",

Far from it. There have been, as there still are, many alternative hypotheses vying for fame. But, as A. P. Coleman wrote in 1926: “During many years of study of glaciations I have hoped to find a solution of the difficulties in several theories at different times but have al- ways encountered some point where they failed.”! Or, as John Bradley, Jr., put it: “Although many explanations have been offered, no universally acceptable hypothesis for the causes of glaciation has yet been pronounced.” And, as W. B. Wright announced in 1937: “It must be admitted that among the theories which have been brought forward to account for the phe- nomena of the Ice Ages, there is not a single one which meets the facts of the case in such a manner as to inspire confidence.” Writing in 1958, Dolph Hooker commented: “The criticism may be made that the above opinions are old and out of date; yet the fact is that every theory in existence today had been previously expounded and was studied by the above critics before their conclusions were reached. Many recent in- vestigators have arrived at the same conclusions which have been cited.”4 In his own work, Hooker enumerates various of these theories, but, as others before him, he reached the same conclusion: “Every one has been analyzed and thoroughly studied by leading scientists throughout the world; and every single one has been rejected as unten- able.”5 But that was in 1958. Is the situation any better at present? </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>A SIMPLE MATTER OF SEVERE WINTERS</center></b></p>\n<p>In 1970, Hubert Lamb and Alastair Woodroffe, both British scientists, seemed to wonder what the ruckus about ice ages was all about. To them the answer seemed a simple matter. Becoming known as the Snowblitz Theory, their explanation was that “an ice age could be started by nothing more dramatic than a succession of harsh winters.” The high latitudes of Europe would have suffered several years of severe winters which would have been followed</p>",
