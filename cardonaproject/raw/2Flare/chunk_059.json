        "main_text": "Such, for instance, was the case of Earth’s electromagnetic field, which is presently dissipating, concerning which ancient man could not have known anything. It was the German mathematician Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss who, in 1832, published a paper on the absolute measurement of magnetic quantities. Then, in 1834, he set up a mag- netic observatory in Gottingen and organized a magnetic union in order to co-ordinate simul- taneous observations of magnetic phenomena throughout various parts of Europe. Since then, Earth’s magnetic field has continued to be monitored down to the present. Correct measure- ment of Earth’s field, Thomas Barnes informs us, “requires statistical reduction of large amounts of data from a worldwide network of magnetic observatories.”! The results from these observations, Barnes tells us, “show that there is no question but that the earth’s mag- netic moment [i.e., the vector quantity that specifies a magnet’s strength and direction] and its associated dipole field have been decreasing” since Gauss’ pioneering measurements,” This was supported earlier by the work of S. Chapman who showed that: “These results certainly suggest a decrease of a few percent in H, and the earth’s magnetic moment during the last century. When the great scale of the phenomenon is considered, this must seem a remarkably large and rapid secular change, not paral- leled for any other worldwide geophysical property.”3 True enough, in 1967, J. A. Jacobs seemed to have indicated otherwise when he wrote that: “Paleomagnetic measurements have shown that the earth’s main field has existed throughout geologic times and that its strength has never differed widely from its present value.”4 This, however, needs a clarification. As long as Jacobs is referring to “the earth’s main field,” he is entirely correct. This is so because, very much as he claimed, Earth’s magnetic field is not really vanishing, slowly or otherwise. It is only its dipole that is weakening. In other words, it is that part of the field which dictates its north and south polarity that is really decaying. The total energy of the magnetic field is not changing, at least not significantly>—and this has not always been understood by past writers on cosmic catastrophism. “Since the time of Gauss’ measurements the earth’s dipole moment has decreased, sensibly linearly, at approximately the rate of 5% per hundred years,” K. L. McDonald and R. H. Gunst continued to verify a year after Jacobs wrote the above words. “Assuming these rates to persist, our analysis discloses that the dipole moment will vanish in A.D. 3991.6",

        "main_text": "“All determinations show a general tendency of a continuous decrease in geomag- netic field intensity during the past 2000 years. However, it is not clear whether this decrease is part of a short-lived exponential decay, or whether it is part of a long- term cyclical variation in field intensity.” Thomas Barnes’ conclusion was that the field was decaying exponentially with a half-life of a mere 700 years,” But, as Severs also noted: “This conclusion is not widely accepted but does follow logically from Barnes’ arguments based on Maxwell’s electromagnetic field the- ory and a freely decaying electric current circulating in the conductive core of the Earth as the source of the Earth’s main magnetic field, a dipole field.”? Severs’ own inclination was toward a cyclical variation: “According to this view, the geomagnetic field intensity is nearly the same at present (8 x 10% gauss cm*) as that of about 2000 B.C. with a minimum between 4000 and 6000 years ago. These variations in the dipole moment of the geomagnetic field, de- termined from archeomagnetic intensity studies, are reported as 500 year averages.” But—of great importance to our thesis— Severs himself continues by stating that: “Japanese and Russian data also imply a cyclic change of the field intensity with a period of the order of 10,000 years. This is in phase with the abrupt climatic change that occurred at the end of the last Ice Age.”° It is also of some import that, besides the effects of relatively nearby supernovae, as al- ready noted, it has also been surmised “that past variations in Earth’s magnetic field effect the radiocarbon dating method.”6 EARTH’S REVERSING FIELD Keeping in mind that we are still talking about the terrestrial dipole, by 1980 it had been calculated that Earth’s magnetic field strength has weakened by 50 percent over the past 2500 years. “If this trend continues,” wrote John White, “the field will disappear altogether— perhaps as soon as early in the next century—and then presumably reappear with reversed polarity.”? And, to be sure, paleomagnetic evidence of Earth’s rocks indicate that Earth’s magnetic field has reversed polarity more than once in the past and will be doing so again in",

Even so, despite that, the tie-in between the decreasing field and its reversal is now a generally accepted tenet of science. As Corey Powell could state in the year 2000: “Every few hundred thousand years Earth’s magnetic field dwindles almost to noth- ing for perhaps a century, then gradually reappears with the north and south poles flipped. The last such reversal was 780,000 years ago...” Powell also claims that “our magnetic field has decreased about 5 percent in the past cen- tury.”3 Thus, with others, he gives the impression that the decrease is not really that exten- sive. Others have claimed that the field “has been diminishing precipitously for the past 150 years,”* again giving the false impression that the decay does not reach into the remote past. But new methods of measuring the strength of Earth’s past magnetic field have revealed that it was three times stronger during the age of the Dinosaurs than it is at present.5 Moreover, computer simulations have recently indicated that a polarity reversal can occur in a mere 1,200 years.° Others have vouched that each reversal may have taken only a few hundred years,’ and even less—fast enough that an observer would have actually seen a compass needle move.’ “780,000 years ago,” as per Powell, is a far cry from the 10,000 years ago of our posited event. Powell, however, is here suppressing earlier evidence since it had already been conceded that one of these magnetic reversals had occurred somewhere between 12,600 and 8,600 years ago,? and/or between 17,000 and 7,000 years ago.!° Known as the Laschamp event, or Laschamp flip, this has even been narrowed down by some to about 10,000 years ago.!! As Peter Warlow noted: “The 10,000-year ago event is the most recent that would be acknowledged by geologists, being the time of the end of the last glaciation and the time which some acknowledge as the most recent well-documented magnetic reversal...”!?",

To quote Frederic Jueneman, “back-calculating from the exponential decay rate [reveals] that Earth would have had an implausibly large magnetic field just a few thousand years ago, something on the order of 20 gauss at about 5,000 BC [when the present value is a mere 0.62 gauss] and approaching the magnitude of a sunspot just beyond 10,000 BC, with the makings of a pulsar by 50,000 BC.”! These values were those reached by Barnes through his computed exponential decay rate based on Gauss’ original value,? which led him to conclude that: “Tt is obvious that this magnetic decay phenomenon could not have been going on for more than a few thousand years, as the magnetic field would have been implausibly large for a relatively neutral body such as the earth. There has to be a relatively recent origin or some catastrophic change somewhere in the more recent half of that timetable.” This was echoed by Jueneman when he wrote that “if the Earth wasn’t something of a magnetic star some 10 millennia ago, an extraordinary and catastrophic change must have taken place in the experience and memory of mankind.”",

Even so, what can be said about this archaeologically-dated pottery? This concerns kiln-fired Etruscan and Attic vases. In such cases, the fired items tend to register the magnetic inclination, or dip, through the iron particles in the clay. A study of these vases by Giuseppe Folgheraiter in 1896 concluded that, in the eighth century B.C., Earth’s magnetic field must have been inverted in both Italy and Greece since the magnetic imprint of these receptacles indicated that the south magnetic pole was closer to the kilns than was the north magnetic one.” Meanwhile, similar studies were conducted by P. L. Mercanton on fired clay pots of the earlier Hallstat age in Bavaria, as also from the Bronze Age caves in the vicinity of Lake Neuchatel. These, however, indicated that during this earlier time, approximately the tenth century B.C., the direction of the geomagnetic field differed only slightly from its present value.3 From these items, Immanuel Velikovsky concluded that Earth’s magnetic field must have reversed its polarity sometime between the tenth and eighth century B.C., preferring the later date because of his own cosmic scenario.4 One objection that was raised against this by the editor of Science News and others is that Folgheraiter was wrong and that the pottery in question had simply been fired upside down.5 But, for one thing, Mercanton had already checked Folgheraiter’s method and results and found them to be beyond fault.6 And, for another, the vases in question could not have been fired upside down because, had they been, the glaze with which they had been coated, which responds to gravity, would have flowed toward their rims.” A more telling objection to these reversals stems from the fact that data derived from lake sediments dated to the same age fail to confirm the reversal,’ which could therefore not have been world-wide. There is additional evidence of a magnetic swing at around 1500 B.C. This came from examination of sediments at Loch Lomond in Scotland? and Lake Windermere in England.!° However, as Kenneth Hoffman indicated, paleomagnetic data obtained from sediments contain too many uncertainties, and have caused too much controversy, to be taken at face",

Aberrant magnetic swings are also indicated by the magnetic signatures detected at ar- chaeological sites in Crete. Here, signatures from sites on the eastern side of the island were found to be identical to one another, whereas they differed from those detected at more central sites on the same island. The events that caused these two sets of magnetic swings were then deduced to have been separated by something like thirty years. Moreover, the direction and intensity of these magnetic signals from central Crete were found to match those of the heavy ash fall deposits on the island of Santorini, ancient Thera, while those from the eastern sites matched the signals detected in the deposits that followed Thera’s paroxysmal eruption during which the volcano collapsed to form the present caldera.? However, the dating of the Theran eruption has been up in arms for decades and there are some who claim that the destruction which struck Crete could not have been caused by the Theran explosion.? And yet, while it is not in the interest of this work to go into all that, the matching of the Cretan magnetic signatures with those of the Theran eruption are too good to be ignored. In the end it was concluded that these swings, including those registered on Attic and Etruscan vases, do not really record a reversal of polarity, but only a geomagnetic excursion.4 These excursions are different from reversals in that the behavior of the field becomes erratic to the extent of changing its direction but not enough to reverse itself. There are even cases where the field seems to have looped upon itself. This behavior has been found to be similar to that attending the onset of reversals and, for that reason, Hoffman has concluded that such excursions are the result of unsuccessful or aborted reversals.° Such excursions and/or transient pulses have been detected in various places—Oregon, Czechoslovakia, China, Japan, and Australia—which, much like Velikovsky did with the Etruscan and Attic vases, Mandelkehr claims for his proposed global event at 2300 B.C.° Even earlier excursions, orthodoxly dated to millions of years, have been detected in basalt lavas from Iceland, Amsterdam Island, Hawaii, and Australia.” True, these excursions still require an explanation—and we shall have more to say about them in a future volume —but since they are not now accepted as the latest total and semi- permanent geomagnetic flip, they need not encumber our present work especially since they fall completely outside the span of time with which this particular work is concerned. We shall therefore continue to concentrate on the 10,000-year-ago event.",
