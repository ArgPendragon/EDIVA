Seeing that our hypothesis calls for a sky that was still bereft of a Moon during the time in question, it behooves us to find out what lies behind this claim? This brings us to Alexander Marshack who, as a science editor and writer, was trying to trace the origins of astronomy and the developments of calendars for a book he was writing in 1963. Perturbed by the dividing line between Paleolithic man with his stone tools and ex- quisite art on one side, and the later agricultural communities with their astronomical obser- vation and sophisticated calendars on the other, Marshack felt obliged to fill the gap. Astron- omy, with its calendars, he reasoned, could not have appeared full-fledged overnight. Some- where, he continued to reason, there must be some evidence of a slow astronomical devel- opment which archaeologists had until then overlooked. If anywhere, this evidence had to have been hidden somewhere in some of the objects reclaimed from the innumerable troves of Paleolithic man. Focusing on an 8,500 year-old bone engraving tool discovered at Ishango at the headwa- ters of the Nile, Marshack noticed that it was covered with scratches on its handle. These scratches appeared to be grouped in a pattern which he believed to be references to the phases of the Moon. Still not happy with the date allotted to this object, Marshack devoted the next nineteen years of his life poring over specimens, always searching for similar, but older, tell-tale marks. He eventually found what he was looking for in the 30,000 year-old tools of the European Cro-Magnons. The scientific papers he then wrote on the subject, to say nothing of his book—The Roots of Civilization—have since turned Marshack into one of the world’s leading authorities on Ice Age art.? One of Marshack’s prime examples of Cro-Magnon lunar notations is a plaque made from a reindeer antler that was discovered in the Dordogne region of France. This plaque bears a number of incisions in a meandering pattern, each of which incision, according to Marshack, must have been made one at a time, with different tools, over an extended period. “[Marshack] could distinguish several tool points and varying pressures. These varia- tions indicated the serpentine line of marks was not a random design struck off at one sitting but rather a purposeful sequence. The marks seemed some sort of tally, and Marshack found that they could be roughly matched to the phases of the moon...”</p>",

        "content": "<p>Tally marks these notations might well have been. But with so many items that the Cro- Magnons could tally, why necessarily the phases of the Moon? As Tom Prideaux, who penned the above quote, was honest enough to state, the marks in question only roughly match the phases of the Moon. Tallying nights—had there been nights as opposed to days to tally—should have been an easy matter. Why not then a more exact counting? Marshack himself believes that the sequence is suggested by the turns in the direction of the meandering line taken by the marks. These changes of direction, he suggests, point to the changes in the direction of the Moon’s motion across the sky following the fifteenth day of its cycle.! But, as depicted by Marshack himself, the tracks of each meander do not all con- tain fifteen marks, as they should. There are counts of fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen. One or two of the marks which seem to fall outside the curve, are not even counted. It can thus be seen that the entire scheme is merely force-fitted to fit the cycle of the Moon, and not all that correctly either. Another item, the artificially notched radius bone of a wolf, from the Magdalenian culture of Moravia, on the other hand, does seem to bear a double notch dividing what has been called the first thirty single notches from the rest.? This, then, is supposed to mark the thirty-day progress of the lunar phases. However, in actuality, there are only twenty-nine notches in the first sequence, while the rest of the notches, that is the second sequence, only number twenty four. And so, similarly, with other items that Marshack has presented as evidence of Paleo- lithic lunar notations. And yet, one may ask: Are clusters of fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen, not close enough to half a lunar cycle? But then, through picking and choosing, one can collect enough items the scratches and dots on which might come close to any set of numbers one might be looking for. What about the slew of other items the scratches or dots on which fall entirely outside any numbers that can be related to the lunar cycle? It is not as if such items do not exist.3 Take, for instance, one of the bone implements discovered at Saint-Marcel, in France.* This is not much different than the one from Moravia discussed above. It, too, has single and double notches of the same type. It falls into the same category. Yet the number of single notches between the two sets of double ones number forty seven. In fact, ar- chaeologists have not attempted to find anything significant in the number of notches on this particular item. They have simply described the piece as “a richly decorated object with simple geometric ornament.”° The point is that anyone can “prove” whatever one wishes through the method of selec- tivity, just as anyone can be swayed by the resulting selective statistics. As Prideaux noted, while some scholars have been convinced of Marshack’s conclusions, quite a few others continue to question his interpretations.®</p>",

This lack, however, has nothing to do with unrecognized evidence of such material. The lack is the result of there having been nothing in the sky or on Earth which would have enabled man to calculate the passage of time, as in fact he later had it recorded in both hemispheres of the world.! Immersed in the perpetual semi- darkness postulated in this work, there would have been no succession of day and night. Of seasonal changes there were also none.? One thing to keep in mind is that while the later Neolithic art, out of the Ice age, proliferated with unmistakable astronomical objects, there is nothing that is even faintly recognizable as anything cosmological in all of bona fide Cro-Magnon art that has so far come to light. There are no depictions of crescent moons or radiating suns—not even the Saturnian sun with which this work is concerned. And why should there have been? Of Sun and Moon there were none. The Saturnian sun, on the other hand, was paid absolutely no attention for the simple reason it had always just hung there, neither rising nor setting, immobile in the north of heaven, doing absolutely nothing. Being born, and living their entire life, beneath its immutability, the Cro- Magnons and Neanderthals would have taken it for granted just as they did the ground beneath their feet. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>INTERBREEDING</center></b></p>\n<p>: </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>PRO ET CON</center></b></p>\n<p>In 1982, while reviewing a controversial novel written by Bjérm Kurtén,? whom he describes as “unquestionably Europe’s finest evolutionary paleontologist,” the just as famous Stephen Jay Gould could still ask the following rhetorical questions: “Did Neanderthal evolve rapidly into Cro-Magnon on the spot?
