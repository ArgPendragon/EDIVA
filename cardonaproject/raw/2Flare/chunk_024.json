It could thus be reasoned that the Israelites, or their Yahwist priesthood, saw fit to identify Yahweh as the older Israelite god known as El, Eloah, and/or",

But that this could not have been the case, and that the direct association of Yahweh with El went further back than the time of Moses, is evidenced by a Mesopotamian text which mentions the god Yau\"-ilu—that is, Yah-E]—which is usually translated as “Jah (or Yah) is god.”! This translation, however, is derived from the fundamentalist argument that El merely meant “God,” whereas it is well known that El was simply the name of a god who was also worshipped by the Canaanites and Phoenicians. It is therefore not improbable, as Cross has surmised, that Yahweh could have been a cultic name for El, an idea that Lloyd Bailey found quite plausible.” It then becomes obvious that the god that Moses introduced to his people was the very same one they had been worshipping since the time of Abraham un- der a different name. Whether Moses knew this or not remains a moot question. That El was the anthropomorphic manifestation of the planet Saturn we know from those very ancients who venerated him. Moreover, in a text discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls, the god of Genesis is alluded to as “the Lord of the Universe.”? This appellation is near-identical to that attributed to Shamash/Saturn who was hailed as En-Me-Sar-ra, that is “Lord of the Law of the Universe.”* And, to be sure, that Saturn was the god of the Jews has been known since antiquity. Needless to say, this revelation does not sit well with modern Jews, even among those who tend to look favorably on the thesis presented in this very work. This was bad enough when, in the prequel to this work, I restricted my evidence to the Israelite god known as El, Eloah, and/or Elohim.6 But I now stand the chance of exacerbating matters by augmenting the argument to embrace Yahweh, because if Yahweh and El were one and the same, as the Jews themselves, to say nothing of Christians, maintain to this day, the identity of Yahweh as a personification of the planet Saturn simply cannot be ignored. In recent times, even Carl Jung had reached this conclusion when he stated that Saturn, whom he considered Earth’s “second sun,” was “the star of Israel and therefore to some ex- tent identical with Yahweh.” And, similarly, with other modern authors who could not es- cape the equation Yahweh = El = Saturn.’ The belief, however, is much older than that. “That Yahweh and Saturn were identical was a belief widely accepted in antiquity,”?

We should not, therefore, be surprised that when it comes to praises, hymns, and prayers to Yahweh, we find that even these were borrowed from those which had been uttered to other deities. Take, as a for-instance, the song that Moses and the Israelites are said to have sung once they had crossed the Sea of Passage. “Who is like unto thee, O Yahweh?” it is reported that they intoned.! Is this not similar to the Egyptian praises in the Text of Teta in which Osiris is lauded with the words “there is no god like unto thee”? And have we not already identified Osiris, like Yahweh, as an anthropomorphism of the same planet Saturn? The very same words given in the Israelite hymn—“Who is like unto thee?”—were also addressed to Marduk.‘ Not only that but, coincidentally or not, the hymn to Marduk, like that of the Israelites at the crossing of the Sea of Passage, is associated with the tempest and the sea: “Who shall escape from before thy power? Thy will is an eternal mystery! Thou makest it plain in heaven And in the earth. Command the sea And the sea obeyeth thee. Command the tempest And the tempest becometh a calm... Lord, thou art holy! Who is like unto thee?”> Fair enough, Marduk is not identifiable as Saturn. At first a Babylonian deity of little importance, Marduk rose to prominence through the political ascendancy of the city of Babylon.® With very little mythology of his own, Marduk’s adherents appropriated those of other deities. Prime among these was Ninurta,’ one of the Mesopotamian anthropomorphic representations of the planet Saturn.’ As if this was not enough, Marduk also appropriated some of the functions which were originally attributed to Ea,’ as well as Enki,!° his alter ego, both of whom are also identifiable as the Saturnian planetary deity.

That Yahweh was knowingly worshipped as Lord Saturn by the Israelites is evidenced by the very temple Solomon built for his worship. Lawrence Stager was astute enough to realize that Solomon’s Temple, together with the area surrounding it, was patterned after a celestial archetype.! He did not, however, go far enough. Hildegard Lewy went much further with her insightful revelation that Solomon’s Temple was dedicated to Saturn,? even though later Biblical scholars have tended to shy away from this revelation.? Not only were the services in Solomon’s Temple distinguishable as Saturnian rites, its holy of holies was built in the shape of a cube. The telling point here is that, for some now unknown reason, cubic temples were characteristic of Saturnian shrines.‘ It cannot therefore be said that the worship of Yahweh was tainted with Saturnian elements at a later time. In passing it should be mentioned that there were other temples dedicated to Yahweh be- sides the one that Solomon built in Jerusalem.5 Ephraim Stern stressed the fact that King Hezekiah of Judah “sought to centralize the worship of Yahweh in Jerusalem” demonstrates “that Yahweh worship was by no means confined to Jerusalem.”6 “The Bible itself mentions sanctuaries at sites such as Dan, Shechem, Shiloh, Bethel and Beersheba, and archaeology confirms that there were numerous other sanctuaries",

A cultic installation dedi- cated to Yahweh must have existed at Judahite Nebo in Moab during the ninth cen- tury B.C.E.: In his stela, Mesha claims to have taken from Nebo the vessels of Yah- weh that he later used in a sanctuary dedicated to the Moabite god Chemosh.”! Another temple to Yahweh must also have existed at Lachish, “the most important city in Judah after Jerusalem,” to say nothing of others which inscriptions confirm to have existed even outside Israel and Judah—such as at Kuntillet ‘Ajrud, in the Sinai.” The remains of such a sanctuary has even been unearthed at Arad, in the Negev. “De- spite scholarly disputes as to precisely when it was built and when it was destroyed, it is clear that the Arad sanctuary was in service simultaneously with the Jerusalem Temple and was probably in use during most of the monarchy.”4 Like Solomon’s Temple, the Arad sanctuary consisted of three parts: a courtyard, a heikhal (main hall), and a debir (holy of holies). With so many sanctuaries to Yahweh—and there may be others that have not yet been discovered—it becomes evident that the worship of this god was not restricted to Jerusalem or the monarchy that reigned from that centre. One, then, has a right to ask why the Hebrews fell victim to the influence of foreign gods? This raises yet another question: Should the wor- ship of gods other than Yahweh by the Hebrews be seen as apostate? As Werner Keller pointed out, the claim that Yahweh was “King above all gods”> can only have meaning “if people believe in other gods as well.” Psalm 86 states that: “Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Adonai.”? This, too, would be meaningless unless there were other gods with whom Adonai, that is Yahweh as Lord, could be compared. Or why would Yahweh have been said to be “feared above all gods”’® or “exalted far above all gods”? Even in the song of Moses mentioned above, the full verse appears as: “Who is like unto thee, O Yahweh, among the gods?” None of these Biblical declarations—and I could have supplied others—make sense un- less it was believed that Yahweh was not the only god. And why should he have been? There were, after all, other planets besides Yahweh/Saturn. This was so well known that the astral nature of the gods continued to be recognized and debated well into the eighteenth century of the modern era.!! All of this has been discussed in detail for more than one reason, not the least of which is the origin of religion. The god of the Old Testament is the very same god of those faiths",

After all, even Allah, the Muslim god, is merely a form of the Hebrew Eloah. Known also as Iah, or simply Il, Allah has long been recognized as corresponding to the Hebrew El and Elohim.! Like the holy of holies in Solo- mon’s Temple, Allah’s holiest shrine, the Ka’aba in Mecca, is also constructed in the shape of a cube, as its name in fact implies, one of the main characteristics of Saturnian temples. Of greater importance to this work, however, is that this does not merely concern Juda- ism, Christianity, and Islam; it concerns the deities of all other religions, ancient and modern. One should not therefore be confused when we meet the Saturnian deity under a multitude of names. As Frank Manuel shrewdly observed: “Nothing could cause the priests, who doted on rivalry, more concern than a demonstration that all the gods were merely variant names for heavenly bodies...”2 And while Saturn was not the only planet that was looked upon as a god, the Saturnian deity will be found at the very head of every pantheon the world has ever known. He was the first and for a time the only god of humankind. Manuel declared that “the idea of a god” was “the first human invention” and that “religion and civilization were born together.”? True, but only to an extent, since the Saturnian sun had always been there radi- ating on mankind and, therefore, did not need to be invented. Where mankind erred was in imbuing this Saturnian sun with life. For years I had claimed that the concept of deity owes its origin to a star. I will now go further by asserting that the concept of God owes its origin to the planet Saturn.

Under the name Savitri,? for example, Surya is described as a god of night.3 That Surya was originally a name for Saturn we have also documented.* Half a world away, the Mayan god designated GIII was called “Jaguar Night Sun.” As Ken Moss noted: “It is interesting to consider why a jaguar, a creature of the night, became one of the most significant sun gods among the Maya.”> GIII’s epithet of “Night Sun” is however enough to win him a place among the hierarchy of nocturnal suns we discussed in our previous work.

THE SOLITARY DEITY As our previous work also revealed, in the beginning, as far back as man can remember, the Saturnian sun was the only visible luminary in the sky.8 There are still societies today, like the Yakima Indians, who still remember that time when their god of beginnings “lived up in the sky all alone.” THE IMMOBILE GOD Ample evidence has also been provided which indicates that this Saturnian sun had hung immobile in the sky.!° In the Gnostic Acts of Thomas, God is alluded to simply as Rest.!!
