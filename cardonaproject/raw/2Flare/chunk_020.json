But, as usual in such cases, conjectures cannot stand in for evidence. </p>\n<p><b><center style='font-size: larger;'>SUPERNOVAE AND COSMIC RAYS</center></b></p>\n<p>Competing alternatives continued to pile in the late twentieth and well into the twenty- first century. One of these, aired in 1999, blamed the onset of ice ages on cosmic rays, those high velocity atomic particles which are believed to be created by the blasts from exploding stars. These cosmic rays bombard Earth’s atmosphere incessantly but without any perceiv- able harm. Henrik Svensmark, from the Danish Space Research Institute, has however re- thought the process, concluding that these rays not only tend to greatly influence Earth’s weather but may even trigger ice ages. According to Svensmark, these cosmic rays streaking through the atmosphere collide with carbon atoms, thus creating reactions that aid in the trig- gering of cloud formation. Increased cloud cover would then lower global temperatures by reflecting sunlight back into space. Because such collisions create radioactive carbon-14, Svensmark could test his theory by studying sediments containing this signature. He discov- ered that carbon-14 levels in sediments had increased “by almost a factor of two” during the so-called little ice age which occurred in the years between 1300 and 1850.? But, little ice age aside—which event can hardly be compared to bona fide ice ages— cosmic rays at present are not creating extensive glaciation so that, as with other theories, one would have to assume that the cosmic ray bombardment on Earth had to have been much more intense in the past. But this, then, would require a cause for the increase in bom- bardment and, to be sure, a cause was soon concocted by another theoretician. Reviving a theory originally proposed in 1995, Nir Shaviv, who wanted to blame all pre- vious ice ages on supernovae, started by commenting on the rarity of these events. He then circumvented this problem by relying on the Solar System’s periodic passage through the arms of our galaxy. Where Clube and Napier found these arms chock-full of comets, Shaviv found them teeming with supernovae. As Jeffrey Winters reported in 2003: “Overall, supernovas are rare, but as the solar system circles through the Milky way, it sometimes passes through one of our galaxy’s spiral arms, where large numbers of massive stars form and explode as supernovas. All those detonations fill the spiral arms with cosmic rays, fragments of atoms traveling close to the speed of light.” As we have just seen, Svensmark is of the opinion that these cosmic rays can create clouds when they hit and pass through Earth’s atmosphere. These clouds, Shaviv agrees, can then trigger global cooling and, thus, a series of ice ages.*</p>",

So, for instance, Flavio Barbiero. Writing in 1974, Barbiero selected two of these past theories and welded them into an abashed alloy of his own making. He first maintained that, because of the Moon’s gravita- tional attraction, Earth is unable to sustain its rotational axis at the same angle to the ecliptic. Earth’s tilt, according to him, varies from between 15 to 20 degrees over a period calculated at about 20,000 years. This causes the ice at the poles to increase and decrease accordingly.! But then, still according to Barbiero, 12,000 years ago, Earth was struck by an asteroid or a comet. The ensuing cataclysm shifted the poles, which event enshrouded Antarctica in a mile-thick mantle of ice. The same event succeeded in melting, and thus reducing, the great ice caps in the north*—never mind that both caps are known to have suffered glaciation at approximately the same time. Barbiero relied in part on the work of the Austrian geologist, Otto Muck, who had claimed that the impacting body, weighing 2 billion tons, impacted in Florida, breaking into two large fragments, on June 5, in the year 8496 B.C., at 20:00 hours (local time).? Such precision—or should one say omniscience?— leaves one aghast! Barbiero then burdened this scenario with the belief that Plato’s Atlantis had actually been located in Antarctica—which item was later picked up by various other dilettantes—the remains of the civilization of which now naturally lies beneath the ice.+ I would not normally have even included Barbiero’s hypothesis, but, as Peter Tompkins noted: “A preface to Barbiero’s book by the director of the Italian Polar Geographic Institute, Silvio Zavatti, attests to the seriousness with which the thesis was received.”&gt; Followers of Barbiero and those who subscribe to the Antarctic/Atlantis theory will hate me for saying this, but I would rather pass this up without further comment. Steven Robinson, who vouched for only one ice age, was another theoretician who blamed ice ages on a dual factor: the tilt of Earth’s axis and high volcanic activity.6 Trevor Palmer is of the opinion that there were more than just two causes working in concert behind the build-up of ice that caused ice ages.

        "content": "<p>“...it seems likely that a proper explanation for Ice Ages must involve the interplay of several factors including asteroid impacts, vulcanism, atmospheric dust, continental drift and Milankovitch cycles. They were clearly complex events.”! It can thus be stated that matters have not improved since Hooker’s day. At the time of this writing, no consensus has yet been reached concerning the cause of ice ages. As Gregg Easterbrook noted: “Few mysteries of natural science are as vexing.”? Just as vexing is the question of what terminates ice ages. “Tf scientists have been perplexed by the genesis of ice ages, figuring out why they stop—why the glaciers start to roll back—has been even more difficult. Some calcu- lations suggest that once ice sheets cover much of the Northern Hemisphere, runaway glaciation ought to lock the Earth forever in deep freeze. Why? Because so much of the land, turned white by ice, will reflect more solar warmth back into space. But thus far runaway ice ages have not occurred.” And: “How ice ages occur is still a mystery, despite theories of orbital changes and ocean currents [to say nothing of the other theorized causes discussed above]...How the very earliest ice ages came to an end is an even greater problem.”* As Francis Hitching reported: “Nobody knows what triggered off the melting of the ice—as Cesare Emiliani, the eminent oceanographer and geologist put it: ‘Question: did the ice melt by surging under its own weight (mechanical collapse), and therefore temperature rose, or did temperature rise and therefore ice melted? If the latter, what produced the extremely rapid temperature rise?’”’&gt; By 1980, John White was still following Charles Hapgood into believing that ice ages were caused by shifts in Earth’s axis and, therefore, had ended through the same mechanism, since every pole shift would have reallocated the centre of the ice caps, both north and south, to different localities.6 The problems inherent in Hapgood’s mechanism for such pole shifts has, however, already been discussed in the prequel to this volume,’ and there would be no point in reiterating it all here.
