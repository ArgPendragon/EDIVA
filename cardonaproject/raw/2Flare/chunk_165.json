This is evidenced through his own admission when he adds that: “Of all these were preserved delineations in the temple of Belus at Babylon.”! And yet one cannot help wondering whether these depictions in stone might not have been confused by Berossus with a somewhat similar description of mutated humanity in some long lost Babylonian tradition. In turn this brings to mind a modern report which appeared in the British newspaper, the Daily Telegraph, which claimed that quite a few infants born within a large radius of the pre- viously mentioned Chernobyl! disaster have been prone to birth defects including short wing- like arms and/or a lower extremity which has been compared to a fish tail.2 We note here two of the characteristics described by Berossus—men with two wings and others with “the tails of fishes.” Additionally, men or women with “one body but two heads” are now known as Siamese twins. The curse of the club foot is also known and these would have been easily compared to goats’ and horses’ feet. To be sure, I will not vouch for the reliability of the Daily Telegraph report since research has led me to believe that no such radioactive mutants have resulted from the fall-out of the Chernoby! disaster. But even if the report was mistaken, deformed arms that look like miniature wings and deformed legs that, together, take on the form of an enlarged fish’s tail are not unknown among human birth defects. Thus, remembering the time in which it was written, the description by Berossus is not really all that far-fetched. Much stranger creatures have exhibited themselves in side “freak” shows in circuses and fairs throughout the world in the recent past. Less dramatic was the Jewish historian Josephus who spoke of nature “which, at certain revolutions of time, produces such mutations in the bodies of men, in the earth, in plants, and in all things that grow out of the earth.”3 Similarly, in the New World we meet the Tupinambas of Brazil whose creator, known as Monan, is often confused with the somewhat lesser deity Maire-Monan. Unfortunately this confusion disallows us from telling which deity was responsible for what follows even though it is presently attributed to Maire-Monan. It is said of this deity that, close to the time of Creation, he had “the power of changing men and animals into other forms.”5 Together with the previous snippet from Ovid, the totality of these reports, garbled as they may be, tend to make us believe that they are based on ancient traditions concerning the appearance of mutations which, in a reduced humanity, would have stuck out like the proverbial sore thumb. Why were these mutations not passed on? We all know about Siamese twins, human gi-</p>",

Although in some cases, espe- cially among human giants, life spans might be shortened, these mutants, as well known, do mate and breed but they give birth to normal children. As in the animal kingdom, it therefore becomes obvious that most of the mutated human individuals who survived proto-Saturn’s flare-up failed to pass their mutated genes to their offspring so that, in a very short time, they would have disappeared completely. At the end of an article dealing with mutation and evolution, James Crow concludes that, “the effects produced by mutations are of all sorts, and are mostly harmful.”! As he goes on: “Some [mutations] cause embryonic death, some severe disease, some physical ab- normalities, and probably many more cause minor impairments of body function that bring an increased susceptibility to the various vicissitudes of life. Some have an im- mediate effect; others lie hidden to cause their harm many generations later. All in all, mutations must be responsible for a substantial fraction of human premature death, illness and misery in general.”? Bear in mind, however, that while Caucasian dwarfs and midgets tend to give birth to normal offspring, African Pygmies give birth to pygmy children. That mutations can be inherited is well known, where such mutations are passed on from mother to child. Thus, for instance, numerous members of a Rhodesian tribe have feet with only two toes that have been compared to the feet of an ostrich or the claws of a lobster. The defect is a hereditary condition, possibly via a single mutated gene. In this particular case, the deformity has been traced to a woman in the Zambesi valley. A relative of hers is known to have settled near Botswana and her two-toed descendants now number in the hundreds.? A better known case among African people is the development of steatopygia, a very conspicuous characteristic what occurs mainly among Bushmen and Hottentots. This consists of a fatty accumulation on the thighs and buttocks and is believed to serve as “food store for the body during periods of droughts.” But, as Josef Wolf notes, “ancient cave paintings show women with steatopygia at times when the Khoisan [Bushmen and Hottentots] were living in relatively fertile, well-watered territory, so this argument may not be altogether correct.” Wolf adds that: “The fact that the condition is much admired by the men indicates that sexual selection may also have played a part in preserving this interesting characteristic.”4 This might be so, but it does not explain how “this interesting characteristic” originated. More importantly, however, is the question concerning the origins of the Negroes and the Pygmies of the African continent. The derivation of man’s racial variety has been debated for many years. What is conceded by all parties is that “the remarkable diversity in our species today has its roots in the changing and sometimes harsh conditions of the last ice age.”&gt; This consensus has been reached because the fossil record of modern-like humans does not stretch</p>",

But, as James Strickling as- tutely asked, “where...did the dark-skinned people of Africa come from?! Quoting C. S. Coon, Strickling stresses that the “origin of the African Negroes, and of the Pygmies, is the greatest unsolved mystery of racial study.” “Wherever any of these people originated, the accepted time scale of their color dif- ferences fits comfortably within the framework of uniformitarianism. We are assured that the ‘differentiation of white, yellow and black races took place over a period of half a million years by mutation’ .”3 But here’s the rub: “Surprisingly enough, in Africa, the continent which is considered by some to be the cradle of human evolution and which has been populated (though on a very restricted scale) by members of the genus Homo for over three million years, the origins and distribution of peoples of modern type are very largely obscure.” In discussing the African Pygmies, Colin Turnbull had this to say: “The BaMbuti, as the Pygmies of the Ituri Forest are known to themselves and to their neighbors, may be the original inhabitants of the great stretch of rain forest that reaches from the Atlantic coast right across Central Africa to the open grassland country on the far side of the chain of great lakes that divides the Congo from East Africa.”5 Moreover: “Their origin, along with that of Negrito peoples [that is, Asiatic Pygmies] elsewhere in the world, is lost in the prehistoric past.”6 As Coon writes: “As far as we know, the Congoid line started on the same evolutionary level as the Eurasiatic ones in the Early Middle Pleistocene and then stood still for a half million years, after which Negroes and Pygmies appeared as if out of nowhere.” Furthermore, they did so in the Upper Pleisto- cene® or, in other words, at the end of the Ice Age. Later studies did not change the picture. “Tt is not until much later in the fossil record, about the beginning of the Neolithic period some 10,000 years ago,” writes Wolf, “that recognizably ‘modern’ Africans can be identified from the skeletal remains.”? And: “It is not until a time-level of about 10,000 years ago that skulls with a definite Negro appearance occur in the fossil record.”!° The absence of earlier Negro fossils has often been blamed on the humid environment of West Africa which is “traditionally viewed” as the Negro homeland, and “which is not</p>",
