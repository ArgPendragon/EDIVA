As we have seen, it was only through creation that\nJanus \u201cassumed the face and members of a god.\u201d Similarly, the Egyptian creator was \u201ca\nformless god [who] stood alone in the \u2018waters\u2019 of the sky...a sphere without external \u2018at-\ntributes\u2019 or \u2018limbs\u2019.\u201d*\u00b0\n\nReturning to Kon Tiki Viracocha, we learn that:\n\n\u201cIn all the accounts, whatever the regional variations, this hero always ap-\npeared as a god-creator who intervened in a world which was already cre-\nated...but unorganized...Viracocha\u2019s role was therefore to transform chaos\ninto cosmos...\u201d\u00b0\n\nMoreover, this myth of the Collao seems to imply that the \u201cearth\u201d which existed prior\nto the creation, or appearance, of light was also considered a creation of Kon Tiki. This belief\nis not to be wondered at for it seems doubtful that man remembers a god older than the Sat-\nurnian figure. But it does seem that he remembers a time when the Sun was not yet apparent\nin the sky. Thus, another myth from the same region explicitly states: \u201cIn the most ancient\ntimes the earth was covered in darkness and there was no sun.\u201d\u201d\u201d The Popul Vuh also relates\nthat before the \u201cearth\u201d was created, \u201cthere was only motionless sea\u201d and \u201cit was night; si-\nlence stood in the dark.\u201d** And again, from a Xingu myth we learn that:\n\n\u201cIn the beginning it was all dark. It was always night. There was no day.\u201d\u201d\u201d",

A moment\u2019s\nreflection, however, should tell one that, for anything to have been visible, there must\nat least have been a modest amount of illumination. Even though not yet glorious as a\n\nsun, Saturn must have still shed some light. And, to be sure, the mytho-historical record is not\n\nexactly silent on this.\n\nThe Book of the Secrets of Enoch describes the beginning of Creation in a somewhat\nfuller manner than does the Book of Genesis. It is from its pages that we learn of the uncoil-\ning of Adoil as the very genesis of this process. In the quote that follows, God is describing\nto Enoch the manner in which he created the cosmos:\n\n\u201cI commanded in the very lowest parts that visible things should come down\nfrom invisible, and Adoil came down very great, and I beheld him, and io! he\nhad a belly of great light.\n\n\u201cAnd I said to him: \u2018Become undone, Adoil, and let the visible come out of\nthee.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd he became undone...\u201d!\n\nThe name \u201cAdoil,\u201d also \u201cIdoil,\u201d probably derives from the Hebrew id El, that is\n\u201chand of God\u201d or, more appropriately, \u201chand of El,\u201d? that is Saturn. The coming undone of\nAdoil, meanwhile, presupposes that the planetary deity had originally been tightly coiled,\nwhich is not at odds with our hypothesized nebular cloud. Note, however, that Adoil is\nclaimed to have had \u201ca belly of great light\u201d even before he became undone to release that\nlight.\n\nThe Eskimo entity known as Raven, whom we have already identified through the\nrules of comparative mythology as a representation of the Saturnian creator, was also said to\nhave first existed in darkness. But there is something else of interest that is contained in this\nmyth as paraphrased by Marion Wood:\n\nSecrets of Enoch XXV:1-4,\n? R. H. Charles, The Apocrypha and Pseudopigrapha of the Old Testament, Vol. 11, p. 445.\n\n283",

He was still small and weak and his special powers had not fully\ndeveloped.\u201d?\n\nGranted that nothing is here said about Raven having contained, or emitted, any light,\nthe fact that he was described as having still been \u201csmall and weak\u201d hints at the apparent in-\neffectuality of the entity involved; as so, incidentally, does the disclosure that his \u201cspecial\npowers had not [yet] fully developed.\u201d What this tells us is that Raven/Saturn had not yet\nevolved into the glorious sun of night described by other races.\n\nA tale similar to that of Adoil comes to us from South America. A. Metraux relates it\nin the following words:\n\n\u201cHere is the tale of creation as told by the Chibcha Indians of Colombia.\nWhen it was dark, before anything in the world existed, light was enclosed in\n\nery\n\nsomething big, which the Muiscas called \u2018Chiminagua\u2019.\n\nThat this light of Chiminagua, like that of Adoil, was later released presupposes its\npre-existence. Something similar is unequivocally stated in the Linga Purana where we read:\n\n\u201cWhen the night of Brahma born of the unmanifest reached the stage of dawn,\nthis visible universe was one that had not been analyzed. It was still enveloped\nin the nocturnal darkness. ..[but]} the self-born lord, he who achieves all the af-\nfairs of the worlds, moved about like a glow-worm, with a desire to mani-\nfest.\u201d\n\nWhat we are here told, then, is that not only was the universe\u2014i.e. this\n\u201cAll\u201d \u2014 originally in darkness, but Brahma, whom we have already identified as Saturn, radi-\nated but only feebly, \u201clike a glow-worm.\u201d This is like saying that Saturn\u2019s glow was not\nenough to dissipate the darkness.\n\nAccording to the Mbaya:\n\n\u201c...the First Being [whom they called Namanduf and/or the Namandu Fa-\nther]...made darkness. He made the cradle of darkness...{but] he did not see\n[this] darkness, though the sun did not yet exist. He was lit by the reflection of\nhis own inner self.\u201d\u00b0\n\n3M.

Nor are microbes the only forms of life that\ncluster around these orifices. In the 1970s, scientists discovered that flues near the Gal\u00e9pagos\nIslands support a thriving community of bacteria, tube worms, and even clams \u201cwhose pri-\nmary source of energy is not light but sulfur compounds emitted by the vents.\u201d\u201d\u00ae\n\nTwo large communities thriving in similar sites were discovered in the eastern Pa-\ncific, a few hundred miles from Easter Island, in May 1981 by members of the Woods Hole\nOceanographic Institution and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Apart from bacteria,\nworms, and clams, these communities also contained mussels, starfish and actual fish which\nwere photographed at depths reaching 9,000 feet. Like the communities discovered earlier,\nthese organisms thrive on chemical energy \u201cindependent of the heat and light from the sun\nthat sustains most life on earth.\u201d\"'\n\n7, p. 6.\n\n5 See here, for instance, the speculative short essay by M.

It\u2019s obvious to us that there must be\nmany, many mere communities in between to make it possible for these ani-\nmals to migrate along the ridge.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it is now being theorized, but by no means universally accepted, that life it-\nself might very well have originated at such vents,\" while it is giving hope to others that life\nmight yet be discovered in the seemingly inhospitable environments known to exist on other\nbodies, both planets and satellites, of our Solar System.\u2019> As Barry Came noted, judging by\nthe evidence of Earth\u2019s ocean bottoms, sunlight does not appear to be a prerequisite.'\u00ae\n\nIn 1998, the submerged Axial Volcano rumbled into renewed life with an outpouring\nof lava that rose to fill an old scar a mile beneath the surface, while Axial\u2019s crater sank by an\nadded 10 feet. Scientists working at the New Millennium Observatory, which monitors the\nocean bottom some 290 miles off the Oregon coast, were offered the chance to study the\ndrifting of continents at first hand. Submersibles, robots, and remote-controlled cameras\njoined forces in collecting information. Apart from the geologic implications of the undersea\neruption, it also gave scientists a chance to study the ecological changes that ensued.\u2019\u201d As re-\nported by Jessica Gorman:\n\n\u201cEven as lava overran old life at the bottom, jets of water squeezed out by the\nvolcano disgorged bacteria that thrive at 220 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014hotter than\nhousehold boiling water\u2014from even more searing environments below.\nDespite the complete lack of sunlight, bacterial colonies bloomed around\nAxial, feeding on volcanic chemicals like hydrogen sulfide, and tube worms\narrived seemingly from nowhere. Such scenes of rebirth are probably com-\nmon along the 40 thousand miles of mid-ocean ridges, where the Earth\u2019s\ncrust is torn apart.\u201d'*\n\nDeep sea life in sunless waters, but away from deep sea vents, has actually been\nknown to exist from much earlier than the 1970s.

To quote Rachel Carson:\n\n\u201cFor the darkness of the lower depths has forced many creatures to make their\nown light. Perhaps half of the fishes that live in dimly lit or darkened water, as\nwell as many of the lower forms, are phosphorescent. Many fishes carry\ntorches that can be turned on or off at will, presumably to help them find or\npursue their prey. Others have rows of light over their bodies, in patterns that\nvary from species to species. This may be a sort of recognition mark or badge\nby which the fish can be known as friend or enemy.\u201d\u201d!\n\nMoreover:\n\n\u201cDown beyond the reach of even the longest and strongest of the sun\u2019s rays,\nthe eyes of fishes are different. They become enlarged, as though to make the\nmost of any chance light of whatever sort. Or they may be telescopic, large of\nlens, and protruding. Some fishes, on the other hand, have become blind, as\nhas happened to certain cave animals that tive m a world of darkness. To\nmake up for their lack of eyes, the blind animals of the sea have marvelous\nfeelers and Jong, slender fins. With these they grope their way like so many\nblind men with canes. They get their knowledge of enemies or food through\nthe sense of touch.\u201d\u201d\n\nSea plants do not grow at these depths so that these \u201chungry flesh-eaters prey fiercely\nupon each other, yet the whole community depends in the end upon the slow rain of food\nparticles descending from above.\u201d\u201d The fierceness of the death struggles that must go on in\nthis Stygian gloom \u201c\u2018is seen in the saber-toothed jaws of some of the small, dragonlike fishes\nof the deeper waters, in the immense mouths, and in the elastic bodies that make it possible\nfor a fish to swallow another several times its size [where] pressure and darkness are the\nconditions of life...\u201d\n\nSulfur-sustained life is found not only around deep sea vents, but also up on land, out\nof the sea, in caverns as dark as the oceans\u2019 abysmal depths.
