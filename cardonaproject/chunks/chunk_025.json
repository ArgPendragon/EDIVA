Having, however, seen that, according to the ancients themselves, the god of the\nOld Testament was really a personification of the planet Saturn, we will have to assume that,\nas astronomically impossible as it might at first seem, the primeval Saturn was believed to\nhave once been situated in the place now occupied by the Pole Star.\n\nOne discordant item the reader may have noted concerns the circumpolar stars them-\nselves\u2014for have we not, on a previous page, argued for the solitude of the very same planet-\nary deity, where no other heavenly body was visible. And, to be sure, we will posit here that,\nwhile Saturn shone as a sun, no stars, except perhaps those of first magnitude, could have\nbeen seen in the night sky. So how, then, could the circumpolar stars have been seen, let\nalone proclaimed as being the stars of El/Saturn? These stars, which we shall meet again be-\niow, could not have been considered the property of El during that time when Saturn ruted\nthe pole. It was only when Saturn resigned his lofty position that the stars came into view for\nthe first time. It was then seen that the circumpolar stars circled around that very area in the\ncenter of which the god of humanity had once resided. For that reason they became sacred to\nthe memory of the god who had, by then, moved elsewhere. But all this will have to be left\nfor a future work. What is of immediate concern here is whether this Saturnian northernism\nis upheld by the beliefs of ancient nations other than the Semites.",

                "content": "In their astronomical treatises, the Babylonians placed their Prime Meridian through the\nnorth pole. The Prime Meridian is the point from which star locations are measured. As\nNorman Schwarz noted: \u201cFor everyone, ever since the time of the Babylonians, the Zero of\nLongitude was an abstract; for the Babylonians, it was a matter of geography.\u201d\u00ae But then: \u201cIf\nthe Babylonians had been like the Greeks, Spanish, British, etc., they would have put their\nPrime Meridian through Babylon; but they did not!\u201d\u00ae Instead they chose the north pole, But\nhow does this relate to Babylonian geography? The geography of which Schwarz speaks was\nnot terrestrial, but, rather, celestial. As he himself informs us, the North Pole was \u201cthe loca-\ntion where the gods had resided,\u201d that is \u201cin the North.\u201d\n\nAs was the case with El, the northern stars were held sacred to Anu.\u00a9 Stephen Langdon\ntells us that An, or Anu, was associated with the \u201cnorthern polar stars.\u201d At Erech, sacrifices\nwere offered \u201cto the polar stars of Anu.\u201d The Pole Star itself was even called the \u201cstar of\nAnu.\u201d Thus, a prayer to the Pole Star began with the words \u201cO star of Anu, prince of the\nheavens.\u201d\u00a9\n\nWe thus find out that, in Mesopotamia, the gods were believed to reside in the north.\n was not only associated\n was a personifica-\ntion of the planet Saturn, we have seen on an earlier page. That the Pole Star was revered as\nthe star of Anu is thus understandable. As we explained in relation to the circumpolar stars\nthemselves, once the planet Saturn was removed from its north polar placement, the Pole Star\nwould have been seen to have taken its place.\n\n*!

These were located in tra-\nditional ancestral cemeteries at Abydos and Saqqara. It is of interest that, associated with\nthese tombs were vast rectangular niched enclosures the long sides of which ran north to\nsouth. Royal officials also built their tombs in ancestral cemeteries apart from those of the\nkings. They, too, were oriented north-south.\u201d\n\nAs Ann Macy Roth pointed out:\n\n\u201cBoth the orientation and the size of these early burial complexes provide clues to the\nancient Egyptians\u2019 beliefs about immortality. The tombs\u2019 sloped northern entrance\npointed to stars in the northern sky that never sank below the horizon [the circumpo-\nlar stars]~suggesting that immortality could be attained by joining these\n\u2018unwearying\u2019 stars.\u201d\u00ae\n\nBy the end of the Third, and the beginning of the Fourth, Dynasty, royal burials shifted to\nwithin true smooth-sided pyramids. Roth was of the opinion that the change came about be-\ncause \u201cthe diurnal death and rebirth of the sun supplanted the perpetual northern stars as the\nmost important symbol of the afterlife.\u201d\u00ae But, other than the recognition that Ra originated\nas a personification of the planet Saturn, rather than the Sun, Roth\u2019s conclusion is altogether\nerroneous because, even in the pyramids she herself mentions, the connection with the cir-\ncumpolar stars continued to be retained.\n\nIn the Pyramid Texts found inscribed on the walls of the Pyramid of Unas, the circumpo-\nlar stars are indirectly associated with Atum. The text deals with the final location in the sky\nthat Unas is meant to achieve after his death. There it is stated:\n\n\u201cThe Father of Unas, Atum, seizes the arm of Unas and he assigns Unas to...the Cir-\ncumpolar Stars.\u201d\u2122\n\n\u201cThou art to purify thyself with the cool water of the Circumpolar Stars.\u201d\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sun-folk shall call out to you, for the Circumpolar Stars have raised you aloft.\u201d\u201d\nFrom this it becomes obvious that, in order to reach his final resting place in the here-af-\n\nter, and be together with Atum for evermore, King Unas needed to travel to the region of the\n\ncircumpolar stars. That Atum is to be identified as the planet Saturn need not be repeated.",

The accompanying text on the Kom Abu Yasin sarcophagus\nlid, however, equates Osiris with this heavenly bull.\u201d That the planet Saturn was known as\nHeru-ka-Pet\u2014that is, Horus Bull of Heaven--is well known.\u201d What is of interest to us here\nis that the inscription on the lid of the sarcophagus in question can be said to place Osiris, as\nthe Bull of Heaven, that is the planet Saturn, in the north polar sphere.\n\nWe do not, however, have to rely on this inscription, since it is well known that Osiris\nwas considered the god of the north,\u201d even though, unfortunately, Wallis Budge understood\nthis in a terrestrial way.\u201d But that the northern locality of Osiris was celestial is evidenced by\nthe fact that his abode was believed to have been \u201cpermanent in Sekhet-hetepet, among the\nimperishable stars,\u201d to which the deceased hoped to ascend.\u201d The \u201cimperishable stars\u201d are\nnone other than the \u201ccircumpolar stars\u201d which, because they circle around the celestial pole,\nare never seen to dip below the horizon and, therefore, viewed as imperishable by the ancient\nEgyptians. The same text also speaks of the deceased as moving and traveling, but this\nshould be understood in relation to the journey of the deceased from Earth to the abode of\nOsiris. This is so true that when the deceased, in this case Pepi I, finally reaches his destina-\ntion, he \u201cstands up at the north of heaven with him,\u201d\u00ae that is with Osiris.\n\nSo, likewise, with Ra, as we learn from the same inscriptions inscribed on the walls of the\nPyramid of Pepi I. In his afterlife, the king was believed to achieve his spiritual destiny only\nwhen he was finally united with Ra in the north of heaven. As it is written: \u201cWhen Pepi\nstandeth upon the north of heaven with Ra, he becometh the lord of the universe, like unto\nthe king of the gods.\u201d*\n\nThat this is so is also evidenced by the fact that Amon-Ra was said to have resided in the\nDivine Land. \u201cBeautiful of Face,\u201d he was lauded, \u201cwho comest from the Divine Land.\u201d\u00ae In\nEgyptian, the Divine Land is rendered as Neter-ta.\u2122 Brugsch, however, defined \u201cNeter-ta\u201d\nor, more correctly, \u201cNeter-ta-Mehti,\u201d as \u201cthe northern land of the gods\u201d and this, as Gerald\nMassey pointed out, is not to be confused with \u201can elevated part of our earth,\u201d but is to be\nunderstood as \u201cthe polar paradise in heaven.\u201d\u2122 For that reason, the deceased was lauded with\nthe words: \u201cMay your face be in the north of the sky, may Re summon you from the zenith\n[\u201ctop\u201d or \u201ccrown,\u201d really] of the sky.\u201d\u00ae\n\nIt can therefore be seen that the Egyptians believed that, once dead, they would be resur-\nrected and made to join their god\u2014Atum, Re, Osiris, all of whom are identifiable as personi-\nfications of the planet Saturn \u2014in the north polar sky.",

But, in view of what has been disclosed above, this should not surprise us.\n\nNow, as it happens, in the Bhagavata Purana, the celestial north pole is described as the\n\u201chighest region of Vishnu.\u201d Again, in the same work, it is stated that \u201cabove Ursa Major\nlies what they call the highest abode of Vishnu\u201d around whom the stars respectfully go\nround.\u00ae The question, here, becomes this: Is Vishnu, like Brahma, to be identified with Sat-\num or with the Pole Star? The question seems to be answered for us in the Kurma Purana\nwhere it is stated that the Lord Vishnu abides ia the place of Dhrava, which is the Pole Star.\u201d\nIn other words, Vishnu was not identified with the Pole Star; it is merely stated that he abides\nin its place. But is there any evidence that Vishnu personified the planet Saturn?\n\nLittle seems to have been known of Vishnu in the Vedic age, and not much is said about\nhim in the oldest Sanskrit work known to us, the Rig Veda. In later Hinduism, however,\nVishnu comes to the forefront as one of the most important deities together with Shiva and\nIndra. In this later mythology, Vishnu is presented as an oft-reincarnated deity who, to use\nthe very words put into his mouth, comes down to Earth \u201cwhenever order, justice and morals\nare in danger.\u201d* These reincarnations of Vishnu, called avatars\u2014(literally \u201cde-\nscents\u201d\u2122)\u2014will not here concern us. We will, instead, focus on the primal godhead himself\nwho, among various other epithets, is known as Svayambhu, he \u201cwho exists of himself.\u201d\u201d Of\nmore importance to us, however, is that we have it on the authority of both the Vishnu Pu-\nrana and the Linga Purana that Vishnu is to be equated with Brahma.*\n\nAnother epithet of Vishnu is Prajapati,\u201d whom we have already seen identified as Saturn.\nAccording to the Brahma Purana, one of his manifestations is that of Surya.\" To this day, a\nsculptured depiction of Vishnu as Surya exists in the thirteenth century A.D. Temple of\nSurya at Konarak, Orissa.\u2019\n\nYet one more epithet of the god is Yamakilah, derived from Yama.'\u201d As we pointed out\nin our first chapter, the Linga Purana tells us that \u201cthe great planet Shaniscara, the slow-\nmoving Saturn, is Yama, the lord of the worlds.\u201d And, to be sure, that Yama was a person-\nification of the planet Saturn is well known.'\u2122\n\nIn the same Linga Purana, Vishnu is made to claim: \u201cI am Kala.\u201d Not to be confused\nwith Kali, Kala is also a name of Yama\u2019\u00ae who was Saturn. Actually, the name Kala itself\nwas that of the planet Saturn. Additionally, a name of Vishnu is Kalakunchah,'\u201d derived\nfrom Kala.\n\n\u00ae Bhagavata Purana 1V:12:25-26.\n\n% Ibid.

                "title": "More than that, another of Vishnu\u2019s various epithets is Mahakala,'\"\u2122 which translates as",
                "content": "\u201cGreat Saturn.\u201d\n\nYet one more epithet of Vishnu is Darunah, a name derived from daruna, meaning\n\u201cterrible.\u201d\" In the Garuda Purana, however, Daruna is given as a name for Saturn.\"\n\nFinally, the name Shaurih is shared by both Vishnu and the planet Saturn.\u201d\n\nThere is therefore litte doubt that, regardless of what Vishnu\u2019s avatars turn out to be, the\nprimal god himself was remembered as a personification of the planet Saturn, which connec-\ntion, as we have just seen, was tendered through various interconnecting equations.\n\nNow the Linga Purana contains a myth, in the form of a parable, which tells how Dhruva\n\nbecame the Pole Star.'\u201d According to this parable, Dhrava was placed at his station by\nVishnu. Moreover, Vishnu impressed on Dhruva that the abode in which he placed him had\nformerly been his. \u201cThis abode,\u201d Vishnu is made to state, \u201cis mine, the greatest, the steady\nsplendid abode.\u201d\n\nThe same parable, in slightly different guise, is also contained in the Bhagavata Purana,\nwhere Dhruva is described ascending to the highest pole \u201cto the exalted seat of Vishnu, round\nwhich the starry spheres forever wander...\u201d '* We can thus see that it was the belief of the\nHindus that the polar station had been Vishnu\u2019s, that is Saturn\u2019s, before it became Dhruva\u2019s,\nthat is the Pole Star\u2019s.\n\nEven more intriguing is the fact that, elsewhere, we learn that Dhruva had previously\nbeen one of the names of the Saturnian sun god himself. Thus, the word dhruva means\n\u201cfixed, firm, stable, permanent, constant, unchangeable\u201d\"\u00ae\u2014which is an apt name for the\nPole Star. Another Sanskrit word with similar meanings of \u201cfixed, firm, unalterable, imper-\nishable, indestructible, undecaying\u201d is akshara.\" It is therefore noteworthy that one of\nVishnu\u2019s epithets is an amalgam of these two words\u2014 Dhruva-akshara. \"\u201d\n\nWe have seen that, according to the Linga Purana, \u201cShaniscara, the slow-moving Saturn,\nis [called] Yama\u201d \u2014a name that was also borne as an epithet by Vishnu. It is interesting, then,\nthat, as Warren tells us, Yama, too, once occupied the north celestial polar station. In his\ntreatment concerning the north polar placement of various deities, he wrote:\n\n\u201cThat the East Aryans had the same idea is also evident from the Laws of Manu.\nAmong this people Yama\u2014the same as the Iranian Yima\u2014was the first man. His first\nabode. ,.was at the North Pole...\u201d\"*\n\nAnd, like their Iranian counterparts, and others from other parts of the ancient world, the\nHindus also faced north for divining purposes. \"?\n\n8 Tbid., p. 749.\n\n\u2018\u00b0 Ibid. p. 497.\n\n\"\u00b0 Garuda Purana 1:62:14.\nU1V_S.

                "content": "So, also, in China. As Warren tells us:\n\n\u201cThe oldest traceable worship among the Chinese is that of Shang-te {or Shang-ti],\nthe highest of all gods...Shang-te is usually...described as the god of heaven. But his\nproper place of abode, his palace, is called Tsze-wei. And if we inquire as to the\nmeaning and location of Tsze-wei, the native commentators upon the sacred books\n\ninform us that it is \u2018a celestial space about the North Pole\u2019.\u201d\"\u201d\n\nThus we find it stated that \u201cShang-te\u2019s throne is in Tsze-wei, i.e., the Polar Star.\u201d And:\n\u201cImmediately over the central peak of Kwen-lun appears the Polar Star, which is Shang-te\u2019s\nheavenly abode.\u201d Shang-ti\u2019s title was The Holy and Propitious Prince of the North Pole.'\u201d\nOne of his symbols, upon which he is sometimes depicted as standing, was the tortoise. The\ntortoise is also sometimes accompanied by a snake. It is therefore noteworthy that the sym-\nbolism of the tortoise and serpent goes at least as far back as the Han dynasty and was used\nas an emblem for the northern region of the world.\u201d\n\nMore than that, as Lord of the Centre, Shang-ti was also revered as Huang- ti,\u201d who is\nperhaps better known as the Yellow Lord\u2019 or Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Emperor has\nlong been acknowledged to be the representative of Saturn.\n\nWhen it comes to ancient Chinese lore, however, we need not merely rely on the mytho-\nhistorical record. Their astronomy echoed the same message. Thus, for instance, the Chinese\nreferred to the Pole Star as T\u2019ien-Fchou which, appropriately enough, means \u201cPivot of the\nSky.\u201d Stars which are close to the Pole Star were also referred to as \u201cpivots.\u201d The same\nname was additionally applied to two stars in the constellation Draco\u201d and, since Draco had\nbeen the polar constellation around 2300 B.C., some authorities have concluded that this\nproves that Chinese observational astronomy dates to at least that remote time.\n\nBe that as it may, the term \u201cpivot\u201d for these Draconian stars fits in with their former\npolar, or near-polar, location. What has baffled commentators on ancient Chinese astronomy,\nhowever, is the fact that the planet Saturn is given the name Tchou-niou-tchi-chin, which\ntranslates as \u201cGenie [or spirit] of the Pivot,\u201d\u2122 since this is tantamount to calling Saturn \u201cthe\nSoul of the Pole Star.\u201d\n\nThat, to the Chinese, the planet Saturn once occupied the north polar center is actually\nwell known. As Jan Sammer indicated:\n\n\u201cAccording to the Han historian Ssuma Ts\u2019ien, the planet Saturn \u2018corresponds to the\ncenter ... Saturn was placed at the pole, and the entire stellar sphere was said to\n\n W.F.
