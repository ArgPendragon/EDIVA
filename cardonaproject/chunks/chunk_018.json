According to Roy Gallant, it\nwould even have glowed:\n\n\u201cJupiter, two and a half times as massive as all the other planets combined, began as\nan enormous gas ball that contracted and heated up...But, unlike the Sun, Jupiter had\nfar too little mass to send its core temperature high enough to start fusion reactions.\nInstead of reaching the millions of degrees needed, the core heated up only a few\nthousands of degrees. So Jupiter became only hot enough to glow cherry-red, like a\nred dwarf star, and for a while it bathed its inner moons in light and heat that faded as\nJupiter slowly cooled.\u201d",

As Sam Flamsteed reported:\n\n\u201cOne possible explanation would be that these are not planets at all but brown dwarf\nstars. A brown dwarf is about as close as a star can get to being a planet without ac-\ntually being one. For one thing, it is small enough to be mistaken for a very large\nplanet, at least from a distance. And since, being small, its core is not put under\nenough pressure for nuclear reactions to take hold, it emits only a dim glow at first\nand then gradually goes dark.\u201d43\n\n\u201cTheorists have always assumed that brown dwarfs must be at least ten times more\nmassive than Jupiter and probably more. But perhaps they\u2019ve overestimated. Maybe a\nbrown dwarf can be six times as massive as Jupiter or even less.\u201d4\n\nBut, as Flamsteed was shrewd enough to notice:\n\n\u201cTo assume that the theorists are baffled, is to underestimate them badly. A good as-\ntronomical theorist never lets the complete absence of information stand in the way of\na nice theory and, conversely, never gets thrown when an actual observation arrives\nto spoil it. Lack of data can actually be an advantage. Unhindered by facts, some\ntheorist is bound to have come up with a model that explains even the strangest\ndiscovery.\u201d45\n\nIn their attempt to explain the anomalous behaviour of the extra-solar planets that every-\none started discovering all over the place, it was even conjectured that there was enough\nmaterial in these systems \u201cto make planets ten times bigger than Earth.\u201d Objects of such size,\nit has been theorized, would be in possession of such gravitational fields powerful enough \u201cto\nact like a gigantic vacuum cleaner.\u201d Such objects tend to suck in \u201cwhatever nearby gas is left\nover.\u201d And the result? \u201cIn a mere 10,000 years or so you have Jupiter\u2014a rocky core ten\ntimes the size of earth surrounded by an immense atmosphere 35,000 miles thick.\u201d4\u201d\n\nApart from Jupiter-sized planets, this hypothesis was later applied to both Jupiter and\nSaturn themselves.\u2018 All of which might make one ask: If a Jupiter-sized planet can form in\nan extra-solar system in 10,000 years or so, how can anyone be positively certain that Jupiter\nitself, or for that matter Saturn, did not take a similarly short time to form? And if that is al-\nlowed as a possibility, then how can one be positively certain that Jupiter and Saturn are bil-\nlions of years old?\n\nEven more was yet to come. After having been so sure they knew just about everything\nthey needed to know about Jupiter, astronomers were in for yet more surprises when Comet\nShoemaker-Levy 9 impacted the planet in July of 1994. In analyzing the aftermath of the\nimpact, they discovered that the planet has far less water than had been expected; the three\npredicted layers of the atmosphere were not detected; strong winds were found to be present\nat all levels of the atmosphere; and the amount of helium turned out to be only half of what\nhad been theorized.\n\n4 S.

So first Jet me state that, as the references themselves indicate, the information in ques-\ntion comes untampered from purely scientific sources. Nor am I here advocating that either\nJupiter or Saturn could sustain nuclear reactions in their cores. Not even Firsoff dared go that\nfar. But such reactions as Firsoff claimed possible were never specified as having to be, or\nhaving been, sustained. The very nature of the mytho-historical evidence I presented in the\npreceding chapters itself negates this possibility. Obviously, so does the present state of these\ntwo planets. Had such reactions been sustained, Jupiter and Saturn would still be flooding the\nnight with their radiated light. To an extent, even Ellenberger is correct. Jupiter and Saturn do\nfail as stars, but only in their present condition.\n\nAlthough it is my belief, and that of a few others, that Saturn was a true sun\u2014which\nmeans that it radiated its own light rather than having reflected that of the Sun as it does\nnow\u2014it must not be understood that it shone with a continuous blinding light. Ancient\nsources impel us to believe that, although brighter than the Moon at night, Saturn was not as\nbright as the Sun. In fact, as will be indicated in a future work, additional evidence indicates\nthat, during the day, Saturn paled in comparison to the Sun.\n\nIt should also be kept in mind that I am not here attempting to make a case for Saturn\nhaving been highly tuminous in historical times, despite the fact that I have cited historical\nsources as evidence. It must be stressed that these sources allude to past events\u2014that is, even\nthough themselves ancient, their allusion is to an even older system. In actual fact, my con-\ntention is that Saturn shone as a nocturnal sun in prehistoric times\u2014that is before the age of\nwriting.\n\nThe stretch from prehistoric to historic times is measurable in only a few thousand years\nso that a critic would be absolutely correct in arguing that this does not change the fact that,\nfor both planets in question, their luminous phase is believed to have terminated billions of\nyears ago. While this is the generally accepted view, it can actually be safely stated that\nJupiter is still slightly luminous. At Jupiter\u2019s size\u2014and mass\u2014has it not occurred to any-\none that something might be wrong with this implied rate of decreasing luminosity had\ndegeneration really commenced billions of years ago? And, by the same token, could not the\nsame be said for its implied rate of cooling?\n\nWhere the presently accepted scientific tenets and the hypothesis presented in this work\ndiffer is precisely in this time factor. And here, as long as one accepts current theory, the hy-\npothesis must falter.\n\nBut is currently accepted theory necessarily correct?

I do realize that this is the\nway science is meant to progress\u2014by replacing old \u201ctruths\u201d with new and, where possible,\ntheory with fact.\n\nLet not what I am about to state next be misconstrued into a fundamentalist stance. Noth-\ning could be further from the truth. But, in the past, geologists and astronomers have steadily\nincreased the age of Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe surrounding them. Is it ac-\ncepted that not a single new discovery can ever make them reverse the process?\n\nPersonally, I have no recourse but to admit that the entire hypothesis presented in this\nwork hinges on historical and mytho-historical sources. But before anyone raises the objec-\ntion that historical sources have no validity where astronomy is concerned, allow me to re-\nmind them that the history of astronomical discoveries, as already indicated in a previous\nchapter, rightly commences with such sources.\n\nThe hypothesis that Saturn was once a sun that shone at night did not originate with me.\nOthers have preceded me\u2014and they stretch all the way back to Sumerian times. Lewis\nGreenberg and Warner Sizemore were the first to bring the matter to my attention.\u00a9? As we\nhave already seen, Morris Jastrow and R. C. Thompson preceded them. But way back of us\nall there stretches a long line of writers who have left a record of this astronomical belief\nregistered on vellum, papyrus, bark, and clay.\n\nMoreover, the combined evidence that led me and my immediate predecessors to this re-\ndiscovery was not culled from mythic sources; it was not based on mythic interpretation.\nGranted that volumes could literally be filled with such complimentary evidence, the fact\nmust be stressed that the original impetus behind this assumption came from what can best be\ndescribed as ancient astronomical assertions.\n\nIn his 1910 paper on the subject, Jastrow attempted to rationalize what to him appeared as\nan impossibility. He could not see what there was in that small pin-point of light we call Sat-\nura that could impel the ancients to allude to it as a sun. As indicated in a previous chapter,\nhis rationalization was a lame one. To repeat what | have already stated\u2014-because it does\nbear repetition\u2014anyone could look up and see that Saturn was anything but a sun. Most\npeople, then as now, would not even have been capable of locating Saturn in the night sky.\nBesides, anyone could see that, Saturn or not, there was no such thing as a night sun. That is\nunless it either was so or once had been.\n\nEven so, it would be amiss for me not to point out that ancient astronomical knowledge\ncan be, as will be, complimented by mythology as long as mythic interpretation retains the\nancients\u2019 own original belief. This is something that has not always been adhered to by mod-\nera mythologists.\n\nModern mythologists, on the other hand, should not be faulted for their misconceptions\nfor they, too, looked up and the only sun they saw was the one that shines upon us now. Nor\nis this a uniquely modern misconception. The ancient Greeks, who appeared relatively late\non the historical scene, among others, suffered the same confusion. To them, Saturn was the\nsame pin-point of light we see in our own night sky. They could not therefore understand\nwhy some of their ancestors called this planet Helios since, to them, Helios was the Sun. As\nwe have seen, the belief that Saturn had once been a sun was so ingrained in the minds of our\n\n51 See here, just as an example, the chapter tilled \u201cThe Re-Designed Solar System,\u201d in W.

True, as stated earlier,\nthere is no way in which Saturn could have shone as bright as the Sun but, for the time being,\nwe will allow the Fiote that much. Even so, the question must be asked: How bright could\nSaturn have been?\n\nHad Saturn, through whatever means, really radiated as a sun, at its present distance it\nwould have been brighter than the full Moon but, in size, it would not have appeared much\nbigger than it presently does. As a star brighter than the full Moon, we can understand why\nthe Assyro-Babylonians could allude to it as the most prominent among the planets. But why\nwould the Saturnian deity, under whatever name, be ailotted a place at the head of every an-\ncient pantheon above the much brighter, and definitely more prominent, Sun? Why would\nSaturn have been considered a greater deity than the Sun itself? Because, let us face it, once\nwe appropriate the roles of deities such as Shamash, Atum, Ra, Surya, Helios, Sol, and oth-\ners, as applicable to Saturn, there is no deity of any significance left to fit the Sun. Call it a\ngut feeling for now, but something impels one to believe there was something more to this\nSaturnian sun besides its brightness that compelled the ancients to revere it, infer alia, as the\nLord of the Law of the Universe.\n\nr | The Fiote of the African Loango Coast believe that the Star Way\u2014which is usually, but",

But, despite Arthur Cook, who\nidentified so many ancient deities as personifications of the sky, it is quite obvious that by\n\u201csky\u201d something different is indicated.
