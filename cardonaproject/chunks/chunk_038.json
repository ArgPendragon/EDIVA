                "content": "Photoperiodism, not to be confused with photosynthesis, is the response of organisms to\nthe duration of light and darkness generated by the succession of day and night. It should\nhowever be noted right from the start that temperature, nutrition, and environmental factors\ncan greatly modify this response. Also, closely related varieties of species can, and do, re-\nspond differently to identical photoperiodic conditions due to inherited differences in their\nmake-up.\n\nWhen it comes to fauna, the most conspicuous activities correlated to photoperiodism\nconsist of changes in pelage and/or plumage, the migratory instincts of birds, and the repro-\nductive process, each of which occurs with marked regularity at a particular time each year.\nWhen animals held in captivity are subjected to artificial lighting conditions which mimic a\nday-night succession that is different from the natural one, reproduction, bird migration, and\nother activities can be induced out of season. This seems to prove that such activities are\nregulated by the changing daily periods of light and darkness\u2014in other words by the succes-\nsion of the seasons.\n\nIn artificial situations, as little as nine hours of light per day was sufficient for stimulating\nthe physiological changes responsible for these activities. The response, it has been found,\nbecomes rapid under long days, and sluggish under short ones. Thus, changes in\nphysiological responses, such as change in breeding season, occurs in certain birds and\nmammals when transported from a southern to a northern latitude and/or vice versa. And yet,\nin equatorial regions, where day lengths are constant, mammals and birds continue to breed,\nchange their plumage, and migrate as if the day lengths actually varied. Do they then keep\ncount of the days? Can they keep time? Or is it that they have adapted so well to their envi-\nronment that their physiology changes without response to photoperiodism? To be sure,\nstudies of certain species of birds failed to show any influence of light on their reproductive\ncycle.\u201d\u201d Would animals not breed had there been no succession of day and night? Would they\nstop breeding in an environment of perpetual dawn and an everlasting spring? Or would they\nadapt?\n\nThe flowering of plants, the formation of roots, runners, tubers, and bulbs are also\ncontrolled by photoperiodism. The photoperiodic reaction of plants takes place in the leaves,\nbut the response occurs elsewhere. Not all plants, however, react the same way. Short-day\nplants, for instance, fail to flower when days exceed a certain duration; long-day plants fail to\nflower unless days exceed a certain duration. The critical day lengths for these plants,\nmoreover, differ widely not only from species to species but also among varieties of the same\n\n\u00b06 Thid.\n\u201d 4.

As we have seen, the duskiness which ancient man relatively described\nas darkness was never one of totality. Saturn would have shed enough light, feeble as it might\nhave been, to dispel the gloom and would have done so continuously. It would also have\nsupplied the required heat.\n\n* D. H.

But one has to keep in mind that if Saturn acted as the sun during mankind\u2019s\nprimitive past, it must also have been Earth\u2019s sun during ages long before. Moreover, since\nSaturn\u2019s present illumination and heat are nowhere close to what we have postulated them to\nhave been during man\u2019s early career on this planet, it stands to reason that its radiant energy\ndissipated relatively fast. This would also make us assume that, in ages prior to the advent of\nmankind, Saturn\u2019s radiant energy, and in fact even its mass, must have been greater still. It is\neven possible that its illumination, at close quarters to Earth, would have been bright enough\nto bathe the world in perpetual daylight rather than the constant dusk that primitive man later\nexperienced. As we have seen, scientific consensus favors a dimmer sun during Earth\u2019s past\ngeologic ages. Could not this dimmer sun have been the Saturnian sun which later greeted\nman\u2019s appearance on Earth?\n\n(What should also be kept in mind is that if our hypothesis is anywhere close to being\ncorrect, the dating of Earth\u2019s past geologic ages would be based on fallacious evidence.)",

Oswald\nHeer described 2,632 Arctic plant species, 1,627 of which were actually discovered by him.\nIn his seven-volume epic on the subject, published between the years 1868 and 1883, Heer\nstressed the luxuriant plant life that thrived during the Tertiary in northern polar regions.\nAmong those that grew in Greenland, he noted magnolias and fig trees.\u00ae Similarly in Spits-\nbergen where he noted the Tertiary thriving of such trees as pines, firs, spruces, cypresses,\nelms, hazels, and even water lilies.\u201d Forests which once flourished in Spitsbergen have left\nseams of coal from twenty-five to thirty feet thick. Fossil specimens of fig palms and the gi-\n, which now grow in California, have been retrieved from an\narea stretching from the Bering Strait to north of Labrador, As D. H. Campbell admitted: \u201cIt\nis difficult to imagine any possible conditions of climate in which these plants could grow so\nnear the pole, deprived of sunlight for many months of the year.\u201d\u00ae Fossil corals, which can\nonly grow in tropical waters, were also discovered there in large formations. Corals, in fact,\ngrew all over polar North America\u2014in Alaska, Canada, and even in Greenland.\u201d\n\nThe same situation is evident at the opposite end of the world in the freezing regions of\nAntarctica. The biggest problem here is that, in past ages, Antarctica was warmer than the\ntropics and equatorial regions themselves by about 90\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\u201d Early in the twentieth\n\n58 O.
