                "content": "Together with the existence of planets in extra-Solar systems, the discoveries enumerated\nabove have added further havoc to the current theory of planet formation. As Zapatero-\nOsorio has stated: \u201cThe formation of young, free-floating, planetary-mass objects like these\nis difficult to explain by our current models of how planets form.\u201d6 And: \u201cThe most\nintriguing question now is how can we explain the formation and evolution of planetary-mass\nobjects outside the solar system?\u201d And, in a press release: \u201cThese free floaters may pose a\nconsiderable challenge to current theories about how planets form.\u201d7\n\nThere was a time when the formation of the Solar System planets was believed to have\nbeen due to material being drawn out of the Sun by a close passing star. This theory was\nhowever discarded in favor of the one now accepted in which the planets are theorized to\nhave formed from the same gas cloud that collapsed through its own gravity to form the Sun\nitself. The material remaining after the Sun had formed is said to have continued to circle the\nSun in its equatorial plane. Known as an accretion disk, this gaseous cloud continued to col-\nlapse into smaller clumps of matter, which clumps eventually aggregated into the planets and\nat least some of their accompanying satellites. There have been various other theories, but the\naccretion disk model became the one most widely accepted.\n\nWhen it comes to extra-solar systems, however, it has recently been discovered that the\naccretion process encounters difficulties. Thus, for instance, 90% of the young stars known to\nexist in the Orion nebula are surrounded by so-called accretion disks \u201cthat could potentially\nclump into new worlds.\u201d But, as Kathy Svitil noted, \u201cmaking a planet, it turns out, isn\u2019t all\nthat easy to do.\u201d7\"\n\n\u201c{Robert] O\u2019Dell christened these disks \u2018proplyds,\u2019 for protoplanetary disks. The\nname may actually be a misnomer, because these disks will evaporate within a mil-\nlion years, probably before planets can form.\u201d\n\n\u201cTntense radiation streaming from the nebula\u2019s brightest infant stars can stop the\nprocess in its tracks, says astronomer C. Robert O\u2019Dell of Vanderbilt University in\nNashville, Tennessee. \u2018Radiation evaporates away the disks in a few hundred thou-\nsand years or less,\u2019 he says, leaving little or no time for planets to coalesce.\u201d\u201d4\n\n&\u00a7_ J.

What makes this system doubly interesting is that, un-\nlike others previously discovered, it resembles mostly our own Solar System. One of these\nplanets has been calculated to have a mass equivalent to 2.6 that of Jupiter, with the other\ncontaining a mere 0.76 of Jupiter\u2019s mass. The two planets therefore \u201chave about the same\nmass ratio as Jupiter and Saturn.\u201d Moreover, unlike other previously discovered extra-solar\nsystems, the planets around 47 Ursae Majoris travel in circular, rather than elliptical, orbits.\nAs Debra Fischer noted: \u201cNow, for the first time, we have a system that looks like it had a\ngentle dynamical history, similar to our own solar system.\u201d What is germane to our present\ntopic, however, came to light when Greg Laughlin conducted a computer simulation of the\nsystem only to discover that \u201cthe gravity of the larger inner planet would jostle planetesimals\nin the star\u2019s habitable zone, preventing them from aggregating into a terrestrial planet.\u201d7\u201d\n\nGranted that the above may be considered unique examples, what about our own Solar\nSystem? Despite everything that had been claimed previously, back in 1960, W. H. McCrea\u2019s\ncalculations indicated that planets could not have originated by aggregation between the orbit\nof Jupiter and the Sun.\u201d8 That same year, R. A. Lyttleton confirmed this assumption through\nhis own calculations, again showing that the terrestrial planets, that is those within the orbit\nof Jupiter, could not have formed from the so-called accretion disk, but must have originated,\nby disruption, from the giant gaseous planets themselves.\u201d? Not everyone agreed, however,\nand, in 1979, Robert Jastrow was still claiming general ignorance when it came to the forma-\ntion of our Solar System\u2019s inner planets. As he wrote:\n\n\u201cWe can understand the birth of the giant planets of the solar system\u2014Jupiter, Saturn,\nUranus, and Neptune...But the smalier planets\u2014the earth, Mars, Venus and Mer-\ncury\u2014their origin is a mystery. Somehow they collected out of tiny grains of matter\nand developed into full-sized planets. We may never know exactly how the earth and\nits sister planets were born.\u201d8\u00b0\n\nBy 1997, there were other astrophysicists who began questioning the theory of planet\nformation through the core accretion mechanism,\u00ae! so that it eventually had to be admitted\nthat the accretion disk model falls flat on its face. By then, Uranus and Neptune were made to\njoin the terrestrial planets as being impossible to have been formed through the accretion\nprocess. As Joshua Roth stated: \u201cPity Uranus and Neptune...no one can even explain why\nthey exist.\u201d8? Agreeing with what has now become the general consensus, Roth declares that\n\n75 \u00a7, Kwok, \u201cMining for Cosmic Coal,\u201d, p. 49.\n\n76 T, P, Ray, op. cit., p. 46.",

News of such a brown dwarf did not take long in coming.\n\nActually, there already had existed indirect evidence for several brown dwarfs orbiting\naround stars. But direct evidence did eventually filter through. This concerned a brown dwarf\nthat Michael Liu and his colleagues discovered through the infrared adaptive-optics systems\nof the Gemini North and Keck telescopes. What these optic systems disclosed was a brown\ndwarf \u201cglowing faintly\u201d around the \u201cSun-like star\u201d known as 15 Sagittae.\u00ae\u2019 If nothing else,\nthis takes care of the objection that the sub-brown dwarf that was proto-Satum had no busi-\nness residing, or settling, within the Solar System. Moreover, in comparison to our Solar\nSystem, the proximity of the brown dwarf in question to 15 Sagittae, \u201cas little as 14 astro-\nnomical units,\u201d would have positioned it \u201cbetween Saturn and Uranus,\u201d\u00ae not far from the\nvery locality in which proto-Saturn itself finally settled.\n\n\u2018What is also interesting is that, according to Liu, this brown dwarf \u201cis too massive to\nhave formed within a circumstellar disk like a planet.\u201d While expressing his belief that\n\u201cthere are a diversity of physical processes that act to populate the outer regions of exoplanet\nsystems,\u201d Liu did not venture to say by what possible procedure such a dwarf could have\nbeen formed. Bo Reipurth, on the other hand, has proposed that \u201cbrown dwarfs begin their\nlives as protostellar \u2018embryos\u2019 just like ordinary stars\u2014but are gravitationally ejected from\ntheir parent gas clouds before they have time to grow.\u201d9!\n\nBut what of the planets in our own Solar System? Planetary ejection had been proposed\nby orthodox astronomers long before the discovery of extra-solar planets. But this was an\nentirely different mode of ejection in which small planets were theorized to have been ejected\nby larger ones. In 1989, V. N. Zharkov and A. V. Kozenko revived this theory by again pro-\nposing that Jupiter must have ejected an \u201cembryo\u201d which then initiated the formation of Sat-\nurn, with further ejected \u201cembryos\u201d forming the planets Uranus and Neptune.\u201d In 1993,\nwhile questioning the very process of what he termed \u201cthe often-invoked idea that planets all\ncondensed from a collapsed cloud of material in orbit around the Sun,\u201d Thomas Van\nFlandern proposed that cosmic bodies are emitted by a fast rotating parent.

How are galaxies formed?\nThe theory that new galaxies are formed by ejection from older galaxies harks back to 1957\nas adduced by Viktor Ambarzumian,\u00ae who has long been regarded as a hero of science in his\nnative Armenia. This theory has also been one of the mainstays of Halton Arp\u2019s career.\nMeanwhile, Hannes Alfv\u00e9n had for long suggested that plasma filaments, which have since\nbeen detected in space in quantum sufficit, are responsible for the formation of galaxies. An-\nthony Peratt, a former student of Alfv\u00e9n who later acted as his secretariat, and who has since\nbecome a renowned piasma physicist presently working at Los Alamos National Laboratory,\ndecided to test Aifv\u00e9n\u2019s hypothesis. What Peratt discovered in the laboratory is that \u201cplasma\nfilaments tend to twist up into what look like tiny spiral galaxies.\u201d Through computer simu-\nlation, he then scaled the action up to galactic size. Starting with two parallel filaments that\nare drawn together by their magnetic fields, and followed by what Eric Lerner called \u201ca pro-\nlonged mating dance,\u201d the filaments merged into a single structure that correctly mimicked a\nbona fide spiral galaxy.

What\u2019s more, indirect measurements suggest that the strength of the mag-\nnetic field in the filaments is far greater than what most astrophysicists thought\npossible on such a scale \u2014but just about what Peratt\u2019s simulations predicted.\u201d\u00b08\n\nThis then raises the question as to where the original filaments that form galaxies come\nfrom. Arp talks of \u201cnewly created matter\u201d as a matter of fact\u00ae as so, also, do most astro-\nphysicists. He, however, clarifies this by stating that \u201cit would not strictly be new creation\nbut merely materialization of mass-energy from a different, perhaps diffuse location.\u201d #%\n\n\u201cOf course if the universe is operationally defined as everything that is detectable or\npotentially detectable there can be no such thing as \u2018new\u2019 matter. So when we speak\nof creation of matter we do not mean matter coming into our universe from some-\n or from nothing. We must mean the transformation\nof previously existing mass-energy. Probably this means materialization from a pre-\nviously diffused state...\u201d 101\n\nGranted, Arp does not speak of plasma, but his \u201cpreviously diffused state\u201d can be under-\nstood as just that. In fact, if we are to believe Alfv\u00e9n, plasma simply exists and, as we have\nseen, the entire Universe is actually composed of 99% of it. As Lerner paraphrased Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s\nargument:\n\n\u201cIn any plasma...tiny vortex filaments form spontaneously, and over time they grow\nlarger and larger. Given enough time...there\u2019s no reason why cosmic filaments\ncouldn\u2019t have grown to a length of billions of light-years. Gathering matter around\nthem, the filaments could have organized the universe into a complex web of mag-\nnetic fields, electric currents, and plasma\u2014a kind of cosmic power grid.\u201d !2\n\nOnce these filaments organize themselves into super-cluster complexes, they will have\nacquired so much mass that they will continue to be shaped by gravity as well as electric and\nmagnetic fields. Gravity itself would break the filaments into \u201ccluster-size clouds of plasma,\nlike beads on a string.\u201d Eventually, while being further compressed by new filaments, the\nplasma will again be broken up and, still according to Alfv\u00e9n, would then form galaxies.\nMore than that, the sequence would continue to be repeated in steps, down to stars, planets,\nand their satellites.13 [t is for this reason that plasma is now considered to be the Funda-\nmental State of Matter. !4 Or, as the renowned physicist David Bohm has been known to\nclaim: \u201cPlasmas are the origin of everything.\u201d!\u00b0\n\nThroughout the years, Arp has supplied a large body of observational evidence verifying\nthe concept.!% Like some of the astral jets emanating from their centres, some galaxies also\n\na Ibid., p. 75.\n\nH.

                "content": "galaxies eject other, perhaps smaller, galaxies laterally along their plane of rotation.' Other\nevidence, however, indicated that galaxies can also be ejected from galaxies along their cos-\nmic jets, that is along their axis of rotation, vertically from either pole. !\n\nStars, of course, are formed in galaxies. Arp believes that stars are also ejected from gal-\naxies through their spiral arms. Actually, he believes the spiral arms themselves to be ejec-\ntions which then become \u201cthe loci of new star formation.\u201d!!\u00b0 But then, in discussing pole-\nward ejections, he stresses that: \u201cThe tyranny of the observations is to insist on opposite\nejection of extragalactic material as a ubiquitous process that operates on all scales.\u201d!!! If\nthat is so, it would indicate that stars, too, could also be ejected poleward in opposite direc-\ntions along galactic plasma jets. And, in fact, Arp gives \u201ca vivid demonstration that the phe-\nnomenon of ejection of discretized bodies not only characterizes the birth of quasars and gal-\naxies...it also extends down into the realm of young star formation.\u201d !!2 He does this by refer-\nring the reader to the photographs of HH 34, which we have already encountered in a previ-\nous chapter as a Herbig-Haro object displaying distinct knots in its jet. He then goes on to say\nthat \u201cthere is an uncanny resemblance between the formation of young galaxies and the for-\nmation of young stars.\u201d!!3 And, to be sure, the belief that Herbig-Haro objects actually give\nbirth to stars is now being preached as a matter of fact.!14\n\nIf galaxies eject galaxies, and galaxies eject stars, all along their plasma jets in opposite\ndirections in direct line with their axis of rotation, can stars eject dwarf stars through the\nsame process? As we have seen, mainstream astrophysicists are now convinced that brown\ndwarfs can be ejected from star forming regions if not from stars themselves. As Reipurth\nphrased it, \u201cthe smallest [stellar] embryos will often be completely ejected from the star-\nforming region, destined to spend eternity alone as brown dwarfs.\u201d But also \u201csome brown\ndwarfs may be kicked out of the star-forming cores.\u201d1!5\nSpeaking of the \u201cknots\u201d seen in the jet emitted by HH 34, Thornhill offered the follow-\ning:\n\n\u201cIn my humble opinion, HH 34 is spitting out objects which might become individual\nbrown dwarfs...\u201d 16\n\nBut if Arp is correct in that the ejection of cosmic bodies takes place at all scales, why\nshould the next step down not be the ejection of planets from brown dwarfs?\n\nThornhill, however, included gas giant planets with these brown dwarfs\u2014and more. As\nhe explained, \u201cbrown dwarfs in the plasma environment of a brighter star become gas giants,\nspitting out rocky planets and moons from their interiors in an attempt to alleviate electrical\nstresses.\u201d When it comes to the direction in which these bodies are ejected, Thornhill then\noffered the following: \u201cWhether the spitting occurs in the polar or equatorial direction de-\n\n107 Ibid. pp. 88, 93.\n\n108 fhid., pp. 88-90, 110-111.\n\n109 Ibid, pp. 87, 88, 110, 118.\n\n110 Iid., p. 105.\n\n411 Jbid., p. 191.\n\n12 Jbid., p, 223.\n\n113 Tbid.\n\n114 See here, for instance, ).

As we have seen, however, ob-\nservations have led him to believe that poleward ejection is a process that operates on all\nscales. So why not brown dwarf stars?\n\nTrue, no jets from brown dwarfs have so far been detected. Because of their low mass\nand feeble optical radiation, however, brown dwarf stars themselves are very difficult objects\nto detect. The detection of any existing jets emanating from them would be all that more dif-\nficult. Even so, there are other emissions from brown dwarfs to be considered. Thus, even as\nthe writing of this book is nearing the end, astronomical discoveries continue to accumulate\nin favor of its thesis. To begin with, on December 15, 1999, Bob Rutledge and his colleagues\nnoted an X-ray flare emanating from the brown dwarf star designated LP 944-20, located in\nthe constellation Fornax, estimated at 16 light-years from Earth. \u201cIt seemed fantastically\nbright and hard to believe,\u201d said Gibor Basri who then hailed from the University of Califor-\nnia at Berkeley. The flare appeared \u201cbriefly as an intense flash before fading out over the\nfollowing two hours.\u201d !24\n\nLess than a year later, a group of graduate students on a National Science Foundation\nsummer program, working at the Very Large Array near Socorro, New Mexico, detected\nstrong radio waves emanating from the same brown dwarf star. These emissions \u201cspiked up\nto 10,000 times stronger than what astronomers thought possible, indicating an intense flare\nof energy that may be similar to flares on the Sun,\u201d researchers said. The dwarf was found to\nemit these radio waves constantly \u201cwith intermittent flares that last for hours.\u201d As Shri Kul-\nkarni stated: \u201cMany astronomers are surprised at this discovery, because they didn\u2019t expect\nsuch strong radio emissions from this object.\u201d!25 Or, as Eduardo Martin, from the University\nof Hawaii, phrased it:\n\n\u201cTt is not surprising that LP 944-20 has flares, but it is surprising that they are so\nbright in the radio [wavelengths]. The result is significant in telling us that brown\ndwarfs break the rules of stellar astronomy.\u201d !26\n\nCall me naive when it comes to plasma physics, but do not these two items tend to throw\na certain amount of doubt re Thornhill\u2019s claim that brown dwarf stars are too electrically low\nstressed to enable them to emit jets. Besides, as Arp discovered in a certain galaxy that he has\nstudied, the radio jet, the X-ray jet, and the optical jet \u201care all coincident and define a precise\nejection axis.\u201d !27 Radio and X-ray emissions thus seem to go hand in hand with optical jets.\nSo if brown dwarfs emit both radio and X-ray emissions, the likelihood of their emitting op-\ntical jets does not seem that far fetched.\n\nAdditionally, and more importantly, there are the so-called accretion, or circumstellar,\ndisks to consider. As we have seen, the birth-place of planets these disks could not be. Most,\nif not all, of the stars emanating plasma jets, however, are also encircled by these disks.

More than that, circumstellar disks are be-\nlieved to be crucial in the formation of jets.32 As one theory proclaims, it is \u201ca mixture of\nions, atoms, molecules and dust\u201d raining onto circumstellar disks along magnetic field lines\nthat accounts for the generation of jets. These magnetic field lines are then said to be \u201cpulled\nin\u201d from the perpendicular, or pinched. Centrifugal force then \u201cflings material outward along\nthe lines.\u201d Finally, the \u201cinertia of the swirling material twists the field lines into a helix,\nwhich helps to channel the outward-flowing material in a vertical direction\u201d !33\u2014 which is so\ndescriptive of a Birkeland current.\n\nif the above turns out to be correct, the newly discovered disks surrounding free-floating\ndwarfs should act in like manner, and one can perhaps see the day when astral jets may yet\nbe detected emanating from brown dwarf stars. And yet we have previously seen that Alfv\u00e9n\nbelieved the jets to have been generated by the induction of electric currents in the interstellar\nplasma toward the centre of galaxies \u201cwhere they turn and flow upwards along the spin axis.\u201d\nTo use Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s own terminology, this current then \u201cshort-circuits\u201d and, dumping vast\namounts of energy into the galaxy\u2019s core, ends up \u201cblowing a fuse.\u201d It is the blast from this\n\u201cfuse-blowing\u201d that propels the jets of plasmas up the spin axes of galaxies. Although Alfv\u00e9n\nwas referring to galaxies, rather than individual stars or less massive bodies, is this method of\ngeneration really that much different from the one proposed above?\n\nThornhill himself seems to accept both methods as being compatible. Thus, concerning\nAlfv\u00e9n\u2019s theory, he has stated that:\n\n\u201cOur Sun, Jupiter and Saturn, etc., all have equatorial plasmoids. It seems to be the\nnormal state for spherical magnetized anodes in a galactic discharge. Only when the\nenergy stored in those plasmoids becomes excessive will it switch to a polar jet (ac-\ncording to Alfv\u00e9n).\u201d 34\n\nBut then, in discussing the proposed circumstellar or placental cloud around proto-Saturn,\nhe also had this to say:\n\n\u201cDwardu [Cardona] mentions proto-Saturn\u2019s accretion disk. Regardless of whether\nthere was such a disk, in my opinion [it] would have nothing to do with accretion and\na whole lot to do with expulsion. Whatever its origin, it would intercept electrical en-\nergy and radiate in the infra-red. In fact it is the infra-red glow from a brown dwarf\nthat is used to infer an \u2018accretion disk\u2019 rather than direct observation.\u201d 35\n\n128K, Wright, op. cit., p. 29.\n\n129 1D.
