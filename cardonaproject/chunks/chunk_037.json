Even if the oceans\u2019 surface were to freeze on the dark side, rea-\nsoned Heath, there might still be liquid layers deep underneath which would be kept from\nfreezing by the planet\u2019s own geothermal heat. \u201cThis would allow liquid water to flow back to\nthe day side.\u201d40\n\nIn the proto-Saturnian model, such a transference of liquid water from one hemisphere to\nthe other would not even be required. As we have seen, according to more than one re-\nsearcher, Earth would have been located within proto-Saturn\u2019s plasma sheath. To repeat, as\nboth Ashton and Thornhill claimed, the heat and light of proto-Saturn would have been \u201cra-\ndiated both outwards and inwards from the photosphere\u201d; that \u201cEarth, situated inside the\nspherical envelope of such a star...would find the energy flux almost equal over the entire\nplanet\u201d; and that \u201call objects orbiting in that region would receive the same energy per unit\narea of their surface.\u201d4!\n\nNo freezing of oceanic surfaces would then enter the picture.",

These plan-\nets, however, are \u201cmore akin to Jupiter\u201d than they are to Earth. Two Jupiter-sized planets, for\ninstance, have been detected circling the red dwarf known as Gliese 876 which is said to lie a\nmere 15 light years from us. \u201cThese particular planets are unlikely to harbour life...since Ju-\npiter-sized planets\u2014at least in our Solar System\u2014consist mostly of hydrogen and helium.\u201d 4%\n\nLaurance Doyle, on the other hand, believes that his team may have detected an Earth-\nsized world around CM Draconis, a binary red dwarf system. Because of the difficulty of\ndetecting such small bodies, Doyle could only supply a \u201c50-50\u201d chance of this being correct.\nIn the meantime, however, he and his team have other candidates which, as of this writing,\nthey were still investigating.47\n\nThere are other details brought out by Croswell in relation to dwarf star planets, but these,\ntoo, must be reserved for a future volume. There is, however, one other element of such a\nsystem that I wish to touch upon because it serves to introduce the subject of the next chapter\nwhich, in turn, will aliow us to investigate further whether an axial alignment of Earth with\nits proto-Saturnian sun was ever the case. As Croswell informed his readers, a red dwarf\nplanet would be bereft of seasons since \u201cthe tidal pull of the star would prevent its spin axis\nfrom tilting.\u201d In the model he espouses, needless to say, only one side would be basked in\nperpetual light, with the other hemisphere being in perpetual darkness. In this model, the\nhottest place on the planet would be one spot on the equator, with temperatures falling in a\nradiating path, \u201cfalling toward freezing near the dividing line between the day and night\nsides.\u201d Moreover, an ice cap would form in the very centre of the night side.\u201c8 As Heath\nphrased it:\n\n\u201cThe daylight hemisphere is going to be where the action is. For one thing, it\u2019s gomg\nto be pretty cold on the dark side. We know that there are organisms that can sit in\nwater pockets in the ice and carry out photosynthesis, but they can\u2019t do that if there\u2019s\nno light getting there.\u201d49\n\nThere is no need here to repeat that this is not the condition expected in an axial aligned\nsystem encased in a plasma sheath. And, as we have also noted, life can, and does, maintain\nand propagate itself in total darkness right here on Earth. So why do I even bring this up? 1\ndo so because a world with no seasons, or with but one season, is precisely what ancient man\nproclaimed to have been the case \u201cin the beginning.\u201d More than hat, it is precisely what we\nfind encoded in Earth\u2019s palaeontological remains.\n\n45 Ibid.\n4 Ibid.\n47 Ibid.\n48 Ibid.\n49 Ibid.\n\n350",

In\nbetween, during the equinoxes, both hemispheres receive the same amount of solar radiation\nbecause Earth\u2019s axis points neither toward nor away from the Sun. This also means that, in\nthe southem hemisphere, the seasons are reversed, with summer coming in winter, autumn\ncoming in spring, winter in summer, and spring in autumn. But, while all this is\nastronomically true, it is not necessarily always apparent down here on Earth. Thus, the\nfourfold seasonal division of the year can seldom be recognized in the annual cycle itself.\n\nIn the Western World, the seasons have been calculated in accordance with the yearly\ncycle of cultivated plants: Winter as the season of dormancy, spring as that of sowing, sum-\nmer as that of growth, and fall, or autumn, as that of harvest. However, as we all know,\nspring and fall are merely transitional periods. Winter and summer are the only two seasons\nthat have a distinctly extreme difference. Beyond that, seasonal temperatures pay no attention\nto the inclination of Earth\u2019s axis. Parts of spring can be as cold or as warm as winter or sum-\nmer, as so, also, can parts of autumn. Climate depends on shifting winds, themselves reliant\non the evaporation of water, and also on the particular topography of the land. Thus, for in-\nstance, because Egyptian harvest was totally reliant on the inundation of the Nile, the ancient\nEgyptian year was divided into only three seasons~-,\n. The Hindus, on the other hand, reckon a six-fold division\u2014rtus: vasan-\n, hima (early win-\nter),' all of which, it is stressed, \u201coverlap one another.\u201d\u201d\n\nSeasons do not mean the same thing to everyone.

Thus,\nin describing Satum\u2019s Golden Age, Ovid spoke of mankind as having been \u201ccontent with\nfoods that grew without cultivation\u201d in \u201ca season of everlasting spring.\u201d'\u201d It was only after\nSaturn\u2019s reign had come to an end that the springtime \u201cwhich had prevailed of old\u201d was\nshortened while \u201ca cycle of four seasons in the year, winter, summer, changeable autumn,\nand a brief spring\u201d was instituted.\u201d And was it not because of this that Janus, whom we have\nalready seen identified by the ancients themselves as Saturnus, was deified inter alia as the\ngod of the seasons?\u00ae\n\nIt was no different in the New World where we have already met the Peruvian Kon Tiki\nViracocha. Having previously identified him as a Saturnian deity, it is not surprising to\ndiscover that he was believed to have been the \u201cguiding power in regulating the seasons\u201d\nwhich seasons were actually ordained by him.\u201d\n\nFurther north in Arizona, the Indians of Oraibi venerated a god called Machito who, like\nthe Saturnian deity of other races, existed in darkness at a time when \u201cthere was no sun, no\nmoon, and no stars.\u201d\u201d! It is said that the people complained \u201cbecause of the darkness and the\ncold.\u201d\u201d While the cold mentioned here might seem to contradict our thesis, it should be\nunderstood that the record in question involves a protracted series of events covering a pe-\ntiod which goes beyond what is encompassed in this work. This cold, of which the mytho-\nhistorical record has much to say, descended upon the world at the end of Saturn\u2019s Golden\nAge\u201d but before the appearance of the seasons. In fact, it was after Machito had produced\nthe Sun, which dissolved the cold, together with the Moon and the stars, that he \u201cappointed\ntimes and seasons,\u201d\u2122\n\nMuch more can be said but, at this point, I must stop because we are now encroaching on\nthe era of Saturn\u2019s Golden Age which actually came later and which topic must be reserved\nfor its proper chronological place in the planned sequel to this volume. Even so, it behooves\nus to remember the words of Frederick Hall who considered the era with which we are\npresently concerned as having been \u201cthe primitive phase of Saturn\u2019s Golden Age.\u201d As he\nwrote:\n\n% thid., p. 105.\n\n\" Ovid, Metamorphoses, 1: 103-107.\n\n8 Ibid., 1: 113-118.\n\n19 Idem, Fasti, 1:125.\n\n\u00b0, pp. 97-98.\n\n1 As quoted by I.
