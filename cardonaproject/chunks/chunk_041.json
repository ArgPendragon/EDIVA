From the 1940s to the mid-1950s, for instance, Ting Ying Ma\nwas involved in the study of corals which led him to declare that the position of the equator\n(and, therefore, also of the poles) had shifted from one geologic age to another.! What did\nthese studies involve?\n\nVery much like trees, corals grow rings which are believed to indicate a cycle of seasonal\ngrowth; in winter, coral cells grow small and dense, whereas in summer they grow larger and\nmore porous. Ma noticed that the rates of total annual growth in corals in identical, or simi-\nlar, species increased with proximity to the equator, while seasonal variation in growth rates\nincreased with distances from the equator. This enabled him to correlate coral growth with\nlatitude, which furnished him with a technique for investigating Earth\u2019s ancient climates. It\nalso led Ma to two related conclusions: That seasonal change was clearly indicated in the\n that the latitudinal temperatures of the past had been about\nthe same as at present. If this is correct, a world without seasons, as proffered in the preced-\ning chapter, could not have existed.\n\nWhat all of this conveyed to Ma was that, in the past, the position of the equator had\nchanged from one geologic period to another and that none of these coincided with the pre-\nsent equatorial position of land. One of these earlier equators was even found to have bi-\nsected the Arctic Ocean.\n\nThe mechanism for this displacement was then attributed to a sliding of the lithospheric\nshell over Earth\u2019s liquid core, like the loose skin of an orange sliding around its fruit. Ma,\nhowever, could not match earlier equators in one hemisphere with corresponding ones for the\nsame period on the opposite hemisphere in order to derive a complete circle. He therefore\nhad to assume that continental drift was also involved and that it was this independent shift-\ning of the continents which had thrown the ancient equators out of line.\n\nThese combined displacements, of which Ma could deduce four separate events, were,\naccording to him, sudden in execution and all in the same direction. He calculated them to\nhave taken place during the last million years with the last readjustment having been com-\npleted 65,000 to 2,800 years ago.\n\nMa was as courageous in advocating continental drift as much as he was in proposing a\nwholesale shift of the lithosphere. Beginning as early as 1861, the theory of continental drift\n\nr | Nedious as it may be to some, this chapter is included in order to forestall the objections\n\n! Most of Ting Ying Ma\u2019s works were published by him in Fukien, China, and are very difficult to obtain\nalthough they are available from the Schermerhom Library at Columbia University. The information\nconceming Ma\u2019s work in the present chapter has been gleaned from C, H. Hapgood, The Path of the Pole (N.\nY., 1970), pp. 26, 79-87, 161, as also from Ma\u2019s paper \u201cAlteration of Sedimentary Facies on the Ocean Bottom\nand Shortness of the Period of Diastrophism After a Sudden Total Displacement of the Solid Earth Shell,\u201d\nOceanographica Sinica \\I:1, in toto.\n\n391",

The theory has now become dogma, proving\nsound Ma\u2019s utilization of it at a time when it was still anathema to do so. On the other hand,\nthe second half of Ma\u2019s theory, concerning the wholesale shifting of earth\u2019s lithosphere\nwhich, in any case, was the brainchild of Hugh Auchincloss Brown,? remained in dispute.\nMa\u2019s theory is thus left reliant on his coral evidence. How valid is this?\n\nFirst of all, as Thomas Stephenson warned in 1959, long after Ma had conducted his\nstudies of corals, older accounts concerning the process of coral formation \u201cshould be read\nwith reserve, since the ideas in vogue on this subject have until recently been largely specu-\nlative\u201d and \u201ctoo much based on the study of the skeleton.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that the skeleton is merely an imperfect if permanent record of the ac-\ntivities of the polyps, and study of the latter reveals the fact that in some cases at least\nconclusions as to the manner of growth, drawn from the skeleton, may be entirely er-\nroneous.\u201d4\n\nGranted that Stephenson was mainly concerned with the growth of coral reefs, the same\ncan be said of older accounts pertaining to the growth of the polyps themselves, as indeed\nStephenson makes clear when he refers to more recent studies by Matthai in relation to the\nformation of coral polyps.>\n\nNow it has long been known that corals are restricted to tropical and sub-tropical zones\ndespite the fact that, in \u201ccertain past epochs,\u201d coral reefs \u201chad a far wider distribution than is\nnow the case, their remains being plentiful in latitudes at which they cannot now maintain\nthemselves.\u201d\u00ae Thus, while Ma\u2019s shifting latitudes could explain coral remains out of present\ntropical and sub-tropical climes, it has nothing to offer regarding their overall much wider\ndistribution.\n\nThe growth of corals requires an average annual water temperature of no less than 70\u00b0 F.\nThe polyps themselves, however, are insensitive to light. But \u201ctheir endodermal tissues con-\ntain myriads of microscopic one-celled algae\u201d which thrive \u201conly in the presence of strong\nlight.\u201d This makes for a highly successful symbiotic relationship since \u201cthe corals rely on the\nalgae to absorb their waste products.\u201d? Thus, both warmth and strong light are necessary for\nthe successful growth of corals and coral reefs.\n\nThe biggest problem with Ma\u2019s evidence, however, concerns the period of time repre-\nsented by a single coral reef which, at most, can be said to bridge a few thousand years,\nhardiy enough to embrace a single geological period. Thus, for instance, as reported by\nCharles Hapgood:\n\n\u201cAt Pago Pago harbor borings were made down to the basalt underlying the reef, and\n was es-\ntimated at 5,000 years. When these spans are compared with those of entire geologi-\ncal periods of the order of 20,000,000 or 30,000,000 years, it is clear how fragile must\n\n2; idem,\n.\n3T. A.

                "content": "In the late 1950s, Hapgood picked up the topic of polar wandering due to Earth\u2019s sliding\ncrust and made a reputation for himself as the theory\u2019s foremost advocate.? Hapgood was\nable to trace the pole\u2019s shift from the Yukon to the Greenland Sea around 80,000-75,000 BP;\nfrom the Greenland Sea to Hudson Bay around 55,000-50,000 BP; and from Hudson Bay to\nits present location around 17,000-12,000 BP.!\u00b0 (Three concurrent paths and positions were\nalso given for the south pole.)!!\n\nNeedless to say, these polar shifts cannot account for the sub-tropical flora and fauna that\nthrived within the Arctic Circle during the Tertiary and preceding eras which have been dated\nto millions, rather than Hapgood\u2019s few thousand, years. Besides, the shifts proposed above\nwould not have brought sub-tropical regions into the Arctic Circle; they would merely have\nshifted latitudes by about 30\u00b0 which, today, would be like moving Winnipeg and Vancouver\nto the latitude of Ellesmere Island.\n\nHapgood was of course aware of this but, as he had to admit, it would be \u201cfutile to try to\ndetermine the location of the poles in the more remote cases\u201d since with \u201cevery step back-\nward in time the evidence naturally becomes thinner.\u201d !2 Even so, despite the scarcity of evi-\ndence, what the totality of Hapgood\u2019s theory proposed is that the region which is now within\nthe Arctic Circle would have earlier been closer to the equator, which would account for its\nsub-tropical flora and fauna, before it shifted to its present location. A neat package, as Al-\nbert Finstein himself had to admit. 3\n\nOriginally, Hapgood had contended that the cause for this crustal slippage would have\ncome about because the accumulation of polar ice is not symmetrically distributed about the\npoles. This maladjusted dispersion was thus believed capable of producing a centrifugal mo-\nmentum which was then transmitted to the rigid crust. As this centrifugal force increased,\nEarth\u2019s crust tended to slide over the viscous layers underneath. (This theory, the brainchild\nof Hugh Auchincloss Brown,'+ has also been maintained by others including Edward\nWeyer.!5) But, although Einstein himself was at first receptive to this idea,!6 he later ex-\npressed strong doubts about it, as so did Kirtley Mather.!7 The biggest problem here is that\nmasses situated at, or very close to, the poles produce minimal centrifugal effect.

In turn, this would also mean that\nEarth \u201cmust be capable of a certain amount of plastic deformation.\u201d >?\n\nIf, then, a large mass was to develop at some intermediate latitude between the pole and\n, Earth\u2019s natu-\nral balance would change, its axts would shift, and the world would have \u201cto adjust its shape\naccordingly\u201d until the extra mass finds its way to the equator.33\n\nFor one thing, however, masses cannot develop out of nothing. And, even if they could,\nas Gold himself admitted, the very plasticity that would allow Earth to topple \u201cwould actu-\nally let the extra mass sink in, and the unbalance would therefore disappear.\u201d3+ How, then,\ndid Gold get out of this situation?\n\nHe did so by proposing that existing land masses like mountain chains, even though par-\ntially sunken, or floating, at different depths in the plastic material below, could change their\nheight, and so also their center of gravity, through erosion or diastrophism. This, too, ac-\ncording to him, would produce an imbalance which would have to be corrected by an ad-\njustment of earth\u2019s shape. Earth would then topple over gradually until it achieves a new\nstable rotational axis.35\n\nGold also believed that it is possible for Earth to have experienced polar shifts without\nhaving undergone continental drift; but continental drift could not have occurred without po-\nlar wandering.\n\nBasing his assumptions on Walter Munk\u2019s calculations, Gold came to the conclusion that\na period between 10 and 100 million years would be required for Earth to turn over by about\n90\u00b036 The time involved would be well within the span of Earth\u2019s geologic past.\n\nGold also considered the wholesale shifting of Earth\u2019s crust, in lieu of axial toppling, as it\nhad been considered by others before him. But while Gold believed this to be dynamically\npossible, he argued that such mechanism would still require \u201ca degree of interior plasticity\nthat would itself allow a yet more rapid turning over of the entire earth\u201d since an \u201cinterior so\n\n3 Ibid.\n29 Ibid.\n30 Ibid.\n31 Ibid.\n32 Ibid.\n33 Ibid.\n34 Tid.\n35 pid.\n36 Ibid.\n\n396",

While received\nopinion held that Earth\u2019s crust was homogeneously undifferentiated, Anderson claimed that\nEarth is really \u201ccompositionally stratified, with the crust, mantle, and core being the most\nobviously chemically distinct shells.\u201d3%\n\n\u201cA chemically layered, gravitationally stable mantle would be the natural end state of\nthe earth\u2019s evolution. The presence of a crust and a core...indicate that differentiation\nor separation is the dominant large-scale process, whereas convection can be expected\nto homogenize the layers between chemical discontinuities.\u201d2?\n\nThis led him to conclude that the convection of Earth\u2019s mantle, rather than being steady\nas believed in by orthodoxy, is episodic and driven by \u201clateral temperature gradients caused\nby continental insulation.\u201d Thus, in his opinion: \u201cActive subduction and stagnant continents\ngenerate geoid highs [that is an area of higher density causing imbalance], which reorient the\nmantle relative to the spin axis.\u201d4! As he pointed out: \u201cIf the earth is deformable, the whole\nmantle should wander relative to the axis of rotation, but the implications of this are seldom\ndiscussed.\u201d4? And: \u201cCuriously, earth scientists have been more reluctant to accept the inevi-\ntability of true polar wandering than to accept continental drift, even though the physics of the\nformer is better understood.\u201d8\n\n\u201cContinents move away from thermal highs [or hot-spots] and come to rest over cold\nparts of the mantle; sea-floor spreading and subduction slow down or cease until the\nsubcontinental mantle warms up. The whole mantle shifts relative to the axis of rota-\ntion to accommodate the changing geode.\u201d*\n\nNeedless to say, in such a scenario, Earth\u2019s outer shell would be stressed by its migration\n.\n\n\u201cThe outer layers of the mantle, including the brittle lithosphere, do not fit properly\non a reoriented earth.

To use Anderson\u2019s own words: \u201cGlobal reorientation\nmay be responsible for initiating rifting [of continents] and subduction and periods of rapid\napparent polar wandering.\u201d4?\n\n\u201cThe rotation axis [i.e. the pole] has apparently wandered about 8\u00b0 in the past 60 mil-\nlion years and 20\u00b0 in the past 200 million years. During these periods there have been\nmajor changes in the configurations of continents and subduction zones. These appar-\nently had minor effects on the principal moments of inertia, suggesting a relatively\nstable and slowly evolving geoid. Even a slowly changing geoid, however, can cause\na rapid shift in the whole mantle relative to the spin axis if the moment of inertia\nalong this axis becomes less than some other axis of inertia. This may have happened\nsometime between 450 and 200 million years ago...\u201d48\n\nAccording to Anderson, large-scale 90\u00b0 shifts can however also occur. As he continues to\ntell us, at present, the rate of polar wandering \u201cis much greater than the average rate of rela-\ntive [continental] plate motion,\u201d and it would have been \u201cfaster still\u201d in ages past.\u201d What is\nmore important to our study: \u201cWhenever there was a major continental assemblage in the\npolar region surrounded by subduction as was the case during the Devonian through the Car-\nboniferous, the stage was set for a major episode of true polar wandering.\u201d\u00ae The southem\ncontinents, according to him, \u201call underwent a large northward displacement beginning\n and continuing to the Tri-\n.\u201d5!\n\nIf this was so, areas which were once south of Earth\u2019s polar regions, together with their\nfauna and flora, would have moved toward the polar regions. But, limiting ourselves to the\nlast 60, a shift of 8\u00b0, as expressed by\nAnderson, would not have been enough to shift sub-tropical areas into the polar circles, and\nthe sub-tropical faunal and floral remains of the high Arctic would remain unsolved.",
