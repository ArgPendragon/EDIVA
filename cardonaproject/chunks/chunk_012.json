In effect, the axis pre-\ncesses around the vertical so that it traces out a cone in space. This additional axial rotation\nthus causes an apparent shift of the stars, as viewed from Earth, which is different from the\napparent daily revolution of the stars around the pole. Whereas the daily rotation causes the\nstars to seem to revolve around the Pole Star, precession causes the Pole Star itse/f to revolve\nin a circle of 231/2\u00b0 radius. Thus, throughout the years, the Pole Star is seen to shift and leave\nthe north celestial pole. If another star is then in the right position, it becomes the new Pole\nStar. At present, the Pole Star is alpha Ursae Minoris, but, at the time of the Greek astrono-\nmers we are presently concerned with, it would have been beta Ursae Minoris.

                "content": "best that can be claimed for Thales is the honor of having been the first Greek astronomer.\nThat being the case, one should attempt to find out exactly how much Thales could have bor-\nrowed from the earlier Babylonians.\n\nThere has been much debate on how much Thales owes his fame to those who later\npraised his name. D. R. Dicks, for one, has insisted that Thales' reputation in having been the\nfirst Greek astronomer comes from later, unreliable, sources, and that, therefore, no validity\nshould be applied to these claims.'\u00ae And while Mullen has found reason to question the evi-\ndence that Dicks relied on, the evidence he himself presented is, at best, circumstantial.\u201d\n\nThose who have sought to devalue Thales\u2019 reputation have also questioned his ability to\npredict eclipses. Both Plutarch\u2019 knew that lunar eclipses were\ncaused by the projection of Earth\u2019s shadow on the lunar surface. The passage of the Moon\nacross the face of the Sun during a solar eclipse would have been more evident, so that it\nwould also have been known that the Moon cast its shadow on earth during such an occur-\nrence.\u201d Even so, knowing what causes a lunar, or solar, eclipse is one thing; being able to\npredict either of them is quite another.\n\nMeanwhile, quite a number of ancient sources, including Herodotus, have claimed that\nThales predicted an eclipse which took place during the battle between the Medes under\nCyaxares and the Lydians under Alyattes.\"* This has led historians to set the date of that\nbattle at 585 B.C. Benny Peiser, on the other hand, has claimed that \u201cThales could not have\npossessed the knowledge necessary to predict eclipses in general.\u201d In this, he might not\nhave been entirely correct. As van der Waerden had earlier noted:\n\n\u201cSuch a feat requires the experience of more than forty years, no matter how one pro-\nceeds. It is not possible to accomplish it alone. But Thales had no Greek predecessors.\nThe conclusion is inescapable that he must have drawn upon the experience af Ori-\nental astronomers.\u201d\n\nBesides, when it comes to the eclipse that is said to have occurred at the time of the battle\nbetween the Medes and the Lydians, a close look at what Herodotus reported tells us that,\nwhile Thales did predict the year of this eclipse, he said nothing concerning the actual date,\nthe time of day, or the place from which it would have been visible. As various scholars have\nnoted, knowledge and a correct understanding of eclipse cycles should have enabled Thales\nto predict the eclipse in question by the day, and not just the year.\n\nIn his attempt to retain, or regain, Thales\u2019 reputation, Mulien has noted that none of the\nscholarly arguments denying Thales the capacity to predict eclipses and other celestial occur-\nrences \u201cis sufficient to prove that Thales did not begin an inquiry into each of these phenom-\n\n182 W.

                "content": "The reconciliation of the motions of the Sun with those of the Moon was required by an-\ncient societies in an endeavor to pin-point their seasonal festivals. Most Greek festivals were\nheld at full moon with certain ceremonies to be held in certain months. The months, there-\nfore, needed to be reconciled with the year. But since twelve lunations fall somewhat short of\nthe solar year, an extra month had to be added to the year every so often.\n\nAccording to Geminos of Rhodes, who wrote sometime in the first century B.C., such a\nsystem of intercalation was already in use \u201csome time before the second half of the fifth\ncentury B.C.\u201d'* The earliest such intercalation by the Greeks that has come down to us in-\nvolved the supplementing of 96 lunar months through an 8-year period, a cycle they called\noctaeteris, with the addition of leap years every third, fifth, and eighth years by inserting an\nextra month into each of them.\u201d\n\nBy the fifth century B.C., however, it had been realized that this 8-year cycle was not all\nthat accurate. The small difference between 99\nand the 8 years into which they tried to fit them accumulated as the years went by so that the\nintegration of the solar and lunar motions was thrown off balance.\n\nIt was the Athenian astronomer Meton who then realized that the Moon returned to the\nsame position in relation to the Sun every 19 years\u2014or so Geminos had it stated, for which\nreason the system has, to this day, been called the Metonic cycle. This cycle works better\nthan the 8-year one because 19 years equal 235 lunations almost exactly.\u201c\n\nIn actual fact, however, there are indications that the Babylonians had been using this 19-\nyear cycle some one hundred years earlier. The Chinese also seem to have known about it,\nalthough it cannot be ascertained just how early the relationship was discovered and/or bor-\nrowed. Known as the chang, dates separated by multiples of 19 years are known from in-\nscriptions on Shang dynasty oracle bones.\n\nDiodorus Siculus also quoted a no-longer extant work by Hecateus of Abdera who also\nmentioned this 19-year return of the Moon and that it was known to the Hyperboreans who\ninhabited an island \u201cnot smaller than Sicily\u201d which was located \u201copposite to the coast of\nCeltic Gaul,\u201d which could only have been Britain.\u201d\n\nIn Tibet, the year is counted as 360 days with the addition of seven intercalary months\nover a 19-year interval set up to keep the phases of the Moon in step with the solar year and\nthe seasons.\u2019\u201d It is not known, however, how old this system is.",
