Let us then continue to re-examine\nthem.\n\nThe father of all Creation myths, at least in the Western World, is that contained in the\nvery first chapter of the Book of Genesis. It is there stated that:\n\n\u201cIn the beginning Elohim created the shemayim and \u2018eretz. And \u2018eretz was tohu wa\nbohu, and darkness was on the surface of the tehom. And the ruach of Elohim moved\nupon the face of the mayim.*\n\nAs we have already seen, Elohim was one of the ancient names of Saturn. Shemayim are\n\u201cthe heavens\u201d\u2014in the plural. Eretz is the word usually translated as \u201cEarth,\u201d but it more\nproperly means \u201cland.\u201d The words tohu wa bohu are traditionally translated as \u201cwithout form\nand void\u201d or \u201cvoid and empty.\u201d The ehom is understood as a watery abyss\u2014the deep. Ruach\nmeans \u201cspirit\u201d or \u201csoul,\u201d but also \u201cwind,\u201d while the mayim are merely \u201cthe waters\u201d \u2014also in\nthe plural.\n\nWhat follows might offend those of a religious bent but, in a scholarly work, this cannot\nalways be helped. Devoid of all religious significance, what the words of Genesis actually\ntell us is that, \u201cin the beginning\u201d \u2014that is, as far back as man can remember\u2014Saturn fash-\nioned the \u201cland\u201d\u2014which originally meant the land of the gods\u2014which was formless and\nempty, while the \u201cspirit,\u201d or \u201cwind,\u201d of the same Saturn moved over the darkened waters.",

Thus, van der Waerden tells us that, in Armenian texts,\nSaturn is called Zruan which is the same as Zurvan.\u201d The later worshippers of Mithra were\nnot therefore wrong when they identified Kronos, the Greek Saturn, with Zurvan.\u201d Actually,\nthe identity of Zurvan as Saturn is well attested.\u201d!\n\nThe implication here is that this nebular cloud was spun off by the rotating Saturnian\nbody out of which the solitary deity\u2014i.e. Saturn\u2014-slowly emerged into view. A near-identi-\neal idea was later proposed by David Talbott when he stated that: \u201cThere is also evi-\ndence...that the participating planets {of the Saturnian system] moved through a diffuse\ngaseous envelope, which almost certainly would have prevented a view of the stars.\u201d??\n\nGriffard\u2019s 1979 suggestion, that an obscuration of sorts could have been emitted by the\nplanet Saturn itself, directed me to the so-called accretion disc, or placental cloud, from\nwhich the planets of the Solar System were supposed to have accreted. Dramatic paintings of\nsuch clouds by noted space artists such as Chesley Bonestell\u201d have appeared quite regularly\nin astronomical journals and illustrated coffee-table books. Turning such pictures upside\ndown, so that I could view the entire panorama from below instead of from above, gave me\nan inkling of what Saturn might have looked like had it also been surrounded by a similar\nplacental cloud. The sky would have been almost completely obscured by the colossal\nnebular disc. Part of Saturn\u2019s southern hemisphere would have protruded through its\nequatorial cloud, thus rendering itself quite clearly as a dull red disc to human eyes. What\nintrigued me about these graphic illustrations many years later was that these circumstellar\nclouds all had the appearance of a whirlpool that seemed to be composed of both fog and\n, thus rendering them somewhat comparable to\nwhat was described in some of the myths paraded in the previous section.\n\nA similar doughnut of gas was found surrounding a nearby star by space scientists at the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, in 1985.\u2122 Dust disks around so-called newborn stars were\n\n25D, Griffard to D.

To be sure, this derivation of the name will remain controversial, but\nwe do not really require it in making our case. As Frank Moore Cross has indicated, the idea\nthat Elohim was a god of the sea actually traces to an ancient belief. An old tradition which\nhe cited has the deity unequivocally stating: \u201cI am EL, in the seat of Elohim ] am enthroned in\nthe midst of the seas.\u201d\u2122\n\nElsewhere, however, the Egyptian Nu\u2014this \u201cprimeval abyss of water\u201d \u2014is alluded to as\npautet or pautti, which has been translated as \u201cprimeval matter.\u201d Thus Ra is made to state: \u201cI\nproduced myself from the primeval matter [which] I made.\u201d \u201cI produced myself from prime-\nval matter.\u201d \u201cI came into being from the primeval matter...\u201d\n\nIt is obvious from all the above that man did not know what he was looking at.
