Were it not so,\nthey might have stumbled over Kala, i.e., Chronos, as a name of Yama, i.e., Kronos,\nalias the planet Saturn.”””\n\nThat Time (Kala) was a name of Yama can also be learned from E. Burgess;'* that the\nHindu Yama, the same as the Persian Yima, was Saturn can be learned from Hermann Col-\nlitz.'° So that this, also, is the same as saying that Time was another name for Saturn.\n\nBesides, leaving Chronos aside, Kronos was himself lauded as “the originator of times.””\n\nKALA\n\nTo the Hindus, the “Wheel of Time” is known as the Kala-cakra (or “chakra”).”' Of im-\nportance to our thesis is the fact that it was Brahma, i.e. Saturn, who is said to turn this wheel\nof time.” In the Svetasvatara Upanishad, it is stated that: “Some wise men, deluded, speak\nof Nature, and others of Time as the cause of everything, but it is the greatness of God by\nwhich this Brahma-wheel is made to turn.”” Thus the same source alludes to Brahma as “the\ntime of time.” The Mundaka Upanishad proclaims that the year, indeed, came from\nBrahma.” What has also significant meaning is the added fact that the waters of chaos, which\nwe have previously had reason to connect with Saturn, were said to have arisen from Kala.”",

If any celestial body can presently claim the right to represent\nthe year, it surely would have to be the Sun. As an indicator of the passage of time, it remains\nsupreme. Even the Moon would have been a better indicator with which to gauge the pro-\ngress of time. Moreover, our ancient forebears, living in this primeval era, would hardly have\neven noticed the planet Satur if it then appeared, like now, as nothing but a pin-point of\nlight in the night sky. More importantly, Dupuis’, or Schlegel’s, as also Stecchini’s, exposi-\ntions do not explain what Saturn, even as Time personified, had to do with Creation. Besides,\nwhy would the slowness of the planet Saturn have led ancient man to believe in an era when\ntime was not?\n\nAs we have indicated in earlier pages, and as we shall show more fully in a sequel vol-\nume, it was the Saturnian deity who was held responsible for the Creation. But, in an Iranian\nRivayat, this role is bestowed on Time. “Time is both Creator and the Lord of Creation which\nit created,” it is there stated.” This is paralleled by the Atharva Veda which states that “Time\ncreated the earth...”** A curious passage concerning Creation in a Hindu Brahmana brings\nvarious elements together:\n\n“Then the seed [of Creation] became a year. Before that time there was no year.”\n\nThus, despite the fact that the waters of chaos were said to have been born of Time, as we\nhave seen above, the reverse was just as true. As it was said, the waters of chaos themselves\nproduced the year, “the ordainer of the days and nights.“ We also have it from the Maitri\nUpanishad that “the year, verily, is Prajapati [that is Saturn, who] is Time.”\n\nWhat all this intimates is that what Hindu sources term as “the year” is a synonym for\n“time.” This synonymy is also apparent in Hebrew where yom (or yowm), which is normally\ntaken to mean “day,” has the additional meaning of “year” but also “time.” So, similarly, in\nEgypt. The word thera, which means “year,” also means “time.” Thus Ptah, whom we have\nalready seen identified as Saturn, was called “the Lord of the Year,” whereas Atum, his al-\nter-ego, was called “the Lord of Time.” The two epithets are synonymous.",

        "content": "\nDIONYSUS\nIn an our first chapter we saw Dionysus as the original impetus behind Greek drama. But\nwho was this god?\nThe mythology of Dionysus presents him as a rambunctious conqueror who spread ter-\nror, as well as civilization, to the (known) world. Wherever he went, he introduced the grape\nvine and, with it, the fermentation of wine. In this respect he was similar to the Egyptian\nOsiris/Saturn who also traveled the (known) world, bringing civilization to the countries he\nvisited, as so did other Saturnian deities.\nEusebius Pamphili (c. 260-340 A. D.) already knew that the Greek Dionysus was the\nequivalent of the Egyptian Osiris. He knew about this equation from Plutarch (c. 46-120 A.\nD.)” and the even earlier Herodotus who lived in the 5th century B.C.* The similarity be-\ntween Dionysus and Osiris, moreover, did not merely concern their histories as civilizers, but\neven their rites. This was so much so that Herodotus was driven to claim that the rites of Di-\nonysus could only have been borrowed by the Greeks from the Egyptians.” These similari-\nties, however, are not restricted to Dionysus and Osiris, but are common to various other\nSaturnian deities. (There is also some indication that, in some quarters, Dionysus was identi-\nfied as an alter-ego of Helios® who, as we have already seen, was the original Greek name of\nthe planet Saturn.)\nThe association of time with Saturn explains why the much later festivals of the New\nYear, touched upon briefly in preceding pages, were devoted to Saturn in his many guises.\nWe should therefore not be surprised to find that among these festivals were those held in\nhonor of Dionysus, who is not only identifiable as the Saturnalian king,” but also directly as\nthe Saturnian deity.” It was not, therefore, spurious of William Heidel to note the obvious\nconnection of Dionysus with Aion.® As Marija Gimbutas informed her readers: “In these\nfestivals, which have assimilated elements of deep antiquity, Dionysus appears as a year-\ngod.”\nQUETZALCOATL UNVEILED\nThe Aztec deity Quetzalcoatl, known to the previous Maya as Kukulkan, has been\nidentified by various authorities as different celestial, and non-celestial, entities: as the Sun;*",

Jill Abery, on the other\nhand, was not quite happy with this identification or with any of the others mentioned\nabove—and rightly so. As she opined:\n\n“Quetzalcoatl is a very ancient god with a multiple of aspects. As the feathered ser-\npent, readers of Velikovsky will have no difficulty in identifying him as Venus in\ncometary garb. But beyond this he is the Lord of healing, learning, beauty, creativity\nand vegetation. He was a benefactor who brought to men the use of metals and the\narts of government; who ruled in an age of perfumed, melodious plenty which can be\nregarded as the Golden Age of Mesoamerica...It would [therefore] appear that Quet-\nzalcoatl was originally the Mesoamerican equivalent of Osiris or Saturn.”\n\nWould that mainstream mythologists had been as astute. Abery, of course, was not the\nfirst to ferret out the true identity of Quetzalcoatl,” but I mention her especially because her\nintuition exemplifies what can be gleaned by a mind which is not constrained by orthodox\nviews.\n\nWhat has confused the issue, and many a mythologist, is the Mesoamerican belief that\nwhen Quetzalcoatl died, his heart flew up and turned into the Morning Star,® which star has\nbeen usually understood as Venus when it appears in the morning®—an event that, as we\nhave seen on an earlier page, is duplicated in the mythology of the Egyptian Osiris/Saturn.\nWhat mythologists and archaeoastronomers seem to forget is that it was the heart of\nQuetzalcoatl, and not Quetzalcoatl himself, which turned into the Morning Star. Quetzalcoatl\nand the Morning Star were thus two entirely different entities.\n\nLet me now state that nowhere in Mesoamerican lore is Quetzalcoatl identified as Saturn.\nIf this identification is to hold, it must do so on the evidence offered by comparative\nmythology.\n\nLike the Saturnian deity of other nations, Quetzalcoatl was considered as the creator.”\nLike the Saturnian deity of other nations, as Abery indicated, Quetzalcoatl was also a\ncivilizer.” As in the Saturnian myths of other nations, Quetzalcoatl was the original one and\nonly god.

Simoni: “All the great gods of the Aztec pantheon, both the tribal gods\nand those they won over [from preceding or neighboring civilizations], have a solar aspect\nand are the Sun in one of its attributes.”” It may thus seem understandable when Quetzal-\ncoatl himself is identified as an aspect of the Sun, not only by Simoni,” but by others as\nwell.” The Codex Borgia actually reinforces this belief when it depicts Quetzalcoatl with the\nsign of Tonatiuh on the back of his head, since Tonatiuh had always been understood to be\nthe Sun. And yet, the depiction in question incorporates the sign for “night” with that of To-\nnatiuh,” thus intimating that Tonatiuh and, by inference, also Quetzalcoatl, was a sun of\nnight. That the sun of night was an aspect of the primeval Saturnian sun we have already\nseen.",
