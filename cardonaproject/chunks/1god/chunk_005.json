It hap-\npened at a time when the recording of history had already reached perfection, at a time when\nevents could be frozen and immortalized on film. And, as it happens, the event in question\nwas exactly so documented. As Greenberg noted:\n“The last two choices are definitely in error. Film footage of the great swastika being\nblown up (as seen in the film The Enigma of the Swastika) leaves no doubt and\nclearly indicates that it was the Zeppelinfeld swastika.”\nIf the memory of events from the recent past can get to be so confused, why should we\nwonder about the faulty memory concerning events from a much more remote past? But\nthen, without a film to document these earlier events, how can we ever be sure of what really\ntranspired?\nTwo lessons to be learned from the above example are these: Despite the differing ver-\nsions as to which swastika was blown up by the invading army, all reports agree on one fact:\nA colossal swastika in Germany was blown up by the invading army. That is the core of this\nparticular historical event. And, in many cases when dealing with contradictory versions of a\nparticular myth, it is the core of the event that we must hold on to and not necessarily the de-\ntailed trimmings, many of which were, in any case, appended to the myths at a much later\ntime. Thus, whether it was just one pair or seven of each animal that Noah was said to have\ntaken into his ark, the core of the different tales remains that he did take male and female\nspecimens of the animals on board. The second lesson is that various versions of an event can\nbe compared and, with a little help from logic, the correct one can often, if not always, be as-\ncertained. When it comes to the science of mythology—and it is a science—comparison can\nbe a very effective tool.\nCOMPARISONS\nHermann Collitz had this to say about the subject:\n“Comparative mythology, in co-operation with the study of popular traditions\n(folklore), has been especially studied with assiduity...Mythological science is not\nintended to serve the knowledge of cultural development—be it of a people or of a\ngroup of closely related peoples—it does not primarily co-operate with philology, but\nit looks for similar ideas in different peoples and it tries to determine types which are\nrepeated in the course of time.”\nIn other words, comparative mythology is that branch of mythology which compares the\nmyths of one nation, or race, with those of another—and, sometimes, even compares the\nmyths of one particular nation, or race, with the divergent myths found within the same na-\ntion or race. Among other things, this is done in order to identify the unidentified protago-\nnists in one myth with the identified ones in another, but similar, tale. An example that comes\nto mind is the following:",

        "content": "\nA tale from the Hindu lore of India concerns the goddess Kali whose thirst for gore—she\nis often portrayed with hanging tongue and mouth dripping with blood—was developed after\nshe had slain the asura (or demon) Raktavira (also known as Raktabija). From every drop of\nblood that fell to the ground from the wounded asura, there sprang another demon possessing\nhis courage, strength, and valor.'® In order to keep Raktavira’s blood from reaching the\nground, and thus generating further demons, Kali, also known as Durga, was forced to drink\nit as it gushed out. This drinking of blood gave her such a blind lust for violence that, when\nshe gave free reign to it, nothing was able to stop her. “On one occasion Shiva himself had to\nmingle among the demons whom she was slaughtering and allow himself to be trampled un-\nderfoot in her dance of victory, as this was the only way to bring her to her senses and save\nthe world from collapse.” '®\nThis myth is very similar to one involving the goddess Anath. In a myth from Ugarit we\nsee Anath coming to the aid of Baal when he was beset by his enemies. As cruel a goddess as\nKali, Anath did not limit her slaughter to demons but went on a drunken rampage against\nmankind from “from the rising of the sun” to “the shore of the sea.”\"™ In the end, Baal was\nforced to intervene in order to stop the goddess from annihilating mankind.\nAs William Albright reported:\n“It has been pointed out by Marvin Pope that there are many traits which Anath\nshares in common with the Indic goddess Kali or Durga. In fact, the respective figures\nare in some ways so similar that coincidence can scarcely be the only explanation.”\nYet another similar myth that both Pope and Albright failed to notice comes to us from\nancient Egypt. Here we read of the goddess Sekhmet, who was said to have been Ra’s de-\nstructive eye, being hurled in anger at mankind. Incited by Ra himself, the goddess began a\nslaughter so complete that she ended up by flooding the world in blood. In both this myth and\nthat of Anath, each respective goddess is described as wading up to her waist in gore. In the\nend, like both Shiva and Baal, Ra himself was forced to intervene and call the goddess\nback.\nAs can be seen, there seems to be no doubt that, in the above three myths, despite the dif-\nference in details, the same event is being described. This leads to the assumption, which we\ncan state beyond a reasonable doubt, that the three goddesses, Kali (or Durga), Anath, and\nSekhmet were merely different names, applied by different nations who spoke different lan-\nguages, of one and the same goddess.\nLet me now concentrate on Anath (sometimes transliterated as Anat) in order to further\nillustrate the methodology behind comparative mythology. What we know of this goddess\ncomes mostly, but not solely, from the tablets discovered at Ras Shamra, the ancient Ugarit,\nin a priest’s house adjoining the temple of Baal.'” In one of these texts we read that Anat\nwas described as a “star.”\"® Her alter-ego, the Persian Anahita (sometimes transliterated as",

        "content": "DIFFUSION\n\nJoseph Campbell, perhaps the most popular mythologist of the latter half of the twentieth\ncentury, began the first tome of his four-volume work, The Masks of God, by pointing out\nthat the “comparative study of the mythologies of the world compels us to view the cultural\nhistory of mankind as a unit; for we find that such themes as the fire-theft, deluge, land of the\ndead, virgin birth, and resurrected hero have a worldwide distribution—appearing every-\nwhere in new combinations while remaining, like the elements of a kaleidoscope, only a few\nand always the same.”\"”° It was thus his view, as it has been that of many another mytholo-\ngist, that the ideas inherent in the mythological record owe their universal distribution to a\nradiating diffusion, especially by contact and mainly from “the nuclear Near East.” As he had\nit stated: “The archaeology and ethnography of the past half-century have made it clear that\nthe ancient civilizations of the Old World—those of Egypt, Mesopotamia, Crete and Greece,\nIndia and China—derived from a single base, and that this community of origin suffices to\nexplain the homologous forms of their mythological and ritual structures.”\"” To be sure,\nthere is no doubt that ideas—knowledge—traveled from one people to another. Thus, for in-\nstance, it has been known for years that ancient Greek astronomical beliefs owed their impe-\ntus to Babylonian knowledge, as well as to that of other nations.\n\nOne may therefore suppose that the similarity of the myths enumerated above conceming\nthe goddesses Anath, Kali, and Sekhmet could have been passed on from one people to an-\nother. Is it not possible, for instance, that the Indo-European Aryans brought the myth of Kali\nwith them, which myth was then passed on to both Canaan and Egypt through migrational\ncontact? Possible, yes; but, despite Campbell, highly unlikely, especially since the three god-\ndesses do not share a common, or similar, name. Thus, for instance, while we can see the\nsimilarity —or, actually, the evolution—of the names from the Canaanite Anath, or Anat, to\nthe Persian Anahita, Anahid, and/or Anaitis, from which we can safely suppose a diffusional\ncontact, direct or otherwise, between Canaan and later Persia, there is nothing linguistically\nrelated between the names Anath, Kali, and Sekhmet. Nor do these three goddesses share a\nsimilarity in their physical depiction. Although pictorial depictions of Anath are rare, she is\nusually portrayed as a seductive-looking female with a very distinctive hair style shaped in\nthe form of the Greek letter omega. Kali, on the other hand, is always depicted as a ferocious-\nlooking and emaciated hag with disheveled hair, vampiric fangs, a lolling tongue, and shriv-\neled pendulous breasts. And while Sekhmet, like Anath, is also shown having the slim con-\ntoured form of a woman, she is invariably given the head of a lioness. One would think that,\nhad two of these goddesses been borrowed from the mythological lore of another nation, or\nrace, they would have retained some similarity of the original’s name and physical appear-\nance. As we have seen, however, it is only in the detailed account of their crazed and bloody\nacts of destruction and death-dealing annihilation that the three goddess bear any similarities.\n\nOn the other hand, without wishing to contradict the above, the cult of the goddess Anat\ndid find its way from Canaan to Egypt. Among her various epithets, Anat was known as\nQadesh, or Qudshu, which simply meant “holy.”'® The worship of this goddess, together\nwith others of Near Eastern origin, was introduced into Egypt when the Egyptians began to\ninfiltrate Palestine. Even so, despite their attempt to Egyptianize the goddess, mainly by\ndepicting her in the company of Egyptian deities, her name of Qudshu (Qetesh or Qeteshi)",

(Here I should note that Wallis\nBudge was in error when he claimed that the Egyptians gave her “the peculiar headdress of\nHathor,”'” since, as we have already noted, her omega-shaped hairdo had always been hers.\nThe fact that the Egyptian Hathor was similarly portrayed by the Egyptians, while not coinci-\ndental, should not blind us to this fact.) There is therefore no doubt that cults and rituals were\ntransferred from one culture to another, but, when this transpired, it left its tell-tale marks. No\nsuch marks are obvious between the cults of Anath and Sekhmet despite the similarity of\ntheir myths.\nAs William Heidel pointed out as early as 1929, “the facile assimilation of one rite to the\nother ... was probably due to the recognition of a common basis in ritual forms.”'® He,\nhowever, warns that there should be “made no assumption of direct borrowing of motives, as\nis often done; such an assumption is methodically without justification where other explana-\ntions of such points of agreement as may be found are possible and sufficient.” ™\n“Ideas, without a material substratum to which they are related, are not so easily\ncommunicated as some historians appear to suppose; the experience of the Western\nworld with the East in our day would seem to show that concrete objects and modes\nof behaviour are far more readily adopted than ideas and ideals.” '”\nSimilar mythological ideas are not, however, restricted to the ancient lore of Asia, Eu-\nrope, and Egypt. They are also to be found on opposite shores of the Old World and the\nNew. Consider, for example, the following aspects of the myths of Osiris and Quetzalcoatl.\nIn Mesoamerica, the priest-king known as Quetzalcoatl was thought of as a civilizer, a\ncompassionate being, a lawgiver and inventor of the calendar.'*\nThe Egyptian Osiris was also thought of as a civilizer. Having become king of Egypt, he\nimparted the arts of civilization to his subjects. He taught them how to till the land, formu-\nlated a code of laws by which they should live, and instituted the rites of the gods.’\nToward the end of his tragic life, Quetzalcoatl “ordered ... that a stone casket should be\nbuilt in which he was to lie four days and nights in strict penance.”\nThe end of Osiris was similarly woeful. His brother and enemy, Set—whom his biogra-\npher, Plutarch, refers to as Typhon—managed to trap him within a chest, which he instantly\nnailed shut and flung into the river.”\nWhen Quetzalcoatl died—some said by throwing himself on a funeral pyre—his heart\nflew out of him into the sky to become the Morning Star.'””\nNow, as is well known, Egyptian rites of the dead attempted to assimilate the deceased\npharaoh to Osiris. In the Text of Unas it is told that “the king’s soul, provided with its words\nof power, flew with its wings to heaven, and ‘opened’ its seat there with the stars of the sky,\nand itself became the morning star ... “\"* Since the dead king was believed to recreate the",
