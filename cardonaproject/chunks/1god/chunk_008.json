        "content": "\nidentified with stars.”\"” They worshipped both the Evening and the Morning Star,'” the\nlatter’s pre-eminence being stressed by many an anthropologist and researcher. In fact,\nMorning Star’s pre-eminence was such that no writer can treat of this North American Indian\nnation without wondering how this star acquired such significance in the religious beliefs of\nthese people. That the Pawnee Morning Star was the planet Mars has now been astronomi-\ncally verified™ and accepted by most anthropologists and archaeoastronomers.”* Up until\n1906, the Pawnee were still offering human sacrifice to it.'”\nSo, similarly, with the more sophisticated nations of Mesoamerica. Thus Susan Milbrath\nhas observed that a “number of scholars agree that the fundamental nature of the ancient\nMesoamerican pantheon is astronomical.”'” The same view has also been echoed by David\nKelley, who wrote: “It has been clear to all serious students of Mesoamerican culture that\nthere was an intimate relationship between astronomical knowledge, the calendar, and reli-\ngious beliefs and rituals.”\nAs Ev Cochrane more recently stated: “A prominent characteristic of Mesoamerican as-\ntronomy, immediately apparent, was their obsession with the observation and worship of the\nplanet Venus.”'” And this despite the fact that B. C. Brundage, on considering the function\nthe planet Venus played among the Mesoamericans, had no recourse but to offer the obser-\nvation that the planet’s true role in the development of this particular culture “is not under-\nstood.”\"® He also, however, added:\n“Jt might not be far wrong to look upon the Mesoamericans’ great skill in numeration\nas a child of that planet and to state that their intellectual life pulsed to its periods.\nCertainly a significant portion of their mythology involved that planet.”\nThus Anthony Aveni, one of the foremost archaeoastronomers of the twentieth century,\ncould not help but avow that “[flor the Maya the importance of Venus ... cannot be over-\nstated.”\"” In fact what student of Mesoamerican lore can delve into the religious beliefs of\nthese people without running headlong into Quetzalcoatl, perhaps the greatest Mesoamerican\ndeity, at whose death, as we have already seen, his heart flew out to become the Morning\nStar.\nBut what of more ancient nations?",

        "content": "The Indic Linga Purana preaches that “the worship of the planets should be pursued by\ngood men,” and then unambiguously identifies each planet with a major Hindu\ndeity —thus:\n\n“Tt is cited that the planet Mars is Skanda (Karttikeya) the commander-in-chief of the\narmy of Devas. People of perfect knowledge say that Mercury is lord Narayan. O ex-\ncellent brahmins, the great planet Shaniscara, the slow-moving Saturn, is Yama, the\nlord of the worlds. The preceptors of Devas and Asuras [that is Shukra and Brihas-\npati] are the great planets Venus and Jupiter with (refulgent) rays. They are\nmentioned as the sons of Prajapati.”\"™*\n\nIn the Hebrew Talmud, the very meaning of “idolatry” is defined as the “worship of stars\nand constellations.”\n\nBut none of this has stemmed criticism concerning the synonymy of planets and gods as\nthey appear in ancient literature and beliefs. That planets were deified and worshipped as\ndeities has, of course, been accepted—and how can it be otherwise when the evidence is\nthere for all to read about. What has not been accepted is that this has always been so. What\ncritics generally claim is that the planets had not always been gods—that, on the contrary, the\ndeification of the planets owes its origin to a late date. But, as I have now been asking for a\nnumber of years, how late is late? Or, to ask a different question, how far back in history can\nthis belief be traced?\n\nIgnoring, or sweeping aside, the statements of Aristotle, critics continue to maintain that\nthe Greek identification of the planets as gods does not trace beyond the 4th century B.C. But\nis Greek lore the yardstick by which to measure the antiquity of anything? The Greeks, after\nall, came somewhat late on the ancient historical scene. What about those nations that were\nolder, much older, than the Greeks?\n\nIn Egypt the planets were also deified. Saturn was called Heru-ka-pet, that is Horus the\nBull of Heaven; Jupiter was Heru-ap-sheta, the Star of the South; Venus was Sbat uatitha, the\nEvening Star; Mars was Heru-khuti and/or Heru-tesher, the Red Horus; and Mercury was Se-\nbku and/or Sebek.’® Granted, it will be pointed out that these names and identifications be-\ncame popular during the late Graeco-Roman period and that they do not trace further back\nthan the 19th Dynasty. But the identity of the Morning Star as Horus was already known\nduring the Old Kingdom and is found recorded more than once in the Pyramid Texts.” In\nfact, to the ancient Egyptians, the synonymy of gods and planets was so complete that, in\nsome instances, the same word was employed to signify either. Thus sba, among other\nthings, meant “star,” but Sba was also the name of a “star” god.’ The word netru meant\n“stars,” but it also meant “gods.” As Faulkner pointed out:",

        "content": "\ncertainly known to have a past that is rooted in primitive polytheistic religion and cel-\nestial mythology ... The question we address is why.”””\nMost mythologists who have favored an astronomical interpretation of mythology have\nhowever been handicapped by the uniformitarian dogma that the Solar System has remained\nunchanged for millions of years. Not only that, some of them have even utilized this dogma\nas the very basis for astro-mythological beliefs. Thus, for instance, Elmer Suhr who could\nfeel confident in reporting that:\n“Astronomy, including manifestations of sun, moon, stars, comets and meteors, has\nthe advantage of remaining constant in its movements and consistently the same in\nappearance over great periods of time; its forms are more geometric, its changes more\nregular, all of which gave the heavens more prestige in the mind of primitive man.””*\nThis, I intend to show, has been the great pitfall of most mythologists who could not rec-\noncile the heaven alluded to by our ancient forefathers with the one that now stretches above\nand around us. And yet, as I hope to demonstrate, it was the very opposite to what Suhr be-\nlieved that lay at the very foundation of mytho-astronomical belief. In fact, what I wish to\nstress is that the astronomical bodies of the Solar System were deified by ancient man the\nworld over not because they consistently followed an ordained pattern, but precisely because\nthey did not.\nAs Lewis Farnell noted early in the twentieth century: “What is normal in nature and so-\nciety rarely excites the myth-making imagination, which is more likely to be kindled by the\nabnormal, some startling catastrophe, some terrible violation of the social code.”\nAnd as the French anthropologist Emile Durkheim (1858-1917) pointed out:\n“.,.that which characterizes the life of nature is a regularity which approaches\nmonotony. Every morning the sun mounts the horizon, every evening it sets; every\nmonth the moon goes through the same cycle; the river flows in an uninterrupted\nmanner in its bed; the same seasons periodically bring back the same sensations. To\nbe sure, here and there an unexpected event sometimes happens: the sun is eclipsed,\nthe moon is hidden behind clouds, the river overflows. But these momentary varia-\ntions could only give birth to equally momentary impressions, the remembrance of\nwhich is gone after a little while; they could not serve as a basis for these stable and\npermanent systems of ideas and practices which constitute religions. Normally, the\ncourse of nature is uniform, and uniformity could never produce strong emotions.”*°\nWhile not exactly an authority on mythological subjects, it is also worth noting the words\nof Frederick Hall who wrote:\n“If we will the myths their proper credence in the light of new evidence of planetary\ncatastrophism, we will find that they can add much to our store of knowledge. All\nmythical accounts may not be equally authentic—and surely many are garbled—but",

        "content": "\nthis simply emphasizes the care that must be taken in research if we are to reach a be-\nlievable consensus between the message of myth and the discoveries of space age sci-\nence.”\nThis is a bold statement to come from an engineer who had worked at the Stanford Linear\nAccelerator Laboratory, but, as we shall see, the content of myth can help us garner new as-\ntronomical knowledge even if, at first sight, this knowledge may appear to be at variance\nwith what we believe we know. In fact, even that so-called pillar of astrophysics, the Big\nBang Theory, had been much earlier posited in a religious work.\nIn the Book of Genesis, Elohim, usually translated into English as “God,” begins the cre-\nation with the words: “Let there be light.” And, it is there written, “there was light.” There\nhave been many who have seen a similarity between this description of beginnings and the\nBig Bang Theory. The following, one of several such, comes from a popular work devoted to\nthe mysteries of the Bible:\n“Prevailing scientific theory proposes that the universe was created in a flash of light.\nThis ‘big bang,’ or cosmic explosion, is believed to have occurred some 16 billion\nyears ago. Some see parallels between this modern, scientific theory and the biblical\naccount which opens with God’s command, ‘Let there be light’.”””\nGranted, on its own, this similarity is not enough for one to claim that the theory in ques-\ntion had already been posited in a religious work. The Book of Genesis is not, however, the\nreligious work I have in mind. So bear with me for a while.\nGeorge Gamow is the acclaimed father of the Big Bang theory. But before Gamow there\nwas Georges Lemaitre who, in 1927, was the first to propose that a hot, dense, primeval\n“atom” had exploded, flinging its contents outward to create the universe.” With the advent\nOf the theory in question, Pope Pius XII himself had it stated that “scientists are beginning to\nfind the finger of God in the creation of the universe.”\"* Lemaitre, who was a Catholic priest\nbesides being a physicist, was later decorated by the Vatican for his scientific achieve-\nments.\nTo be quite fair, in developing his theory of the expanding universe, Lemaitre had relied\non the principles of general relativity. But, since he was also well versed in the discipline of\ntheology, could he not also have come across that great medieval commentary on Biblical\nScripture known as the Ramban? In 1990, in a book titled Genesis and the Big Bang, the Is-\nraeli nuclear physicist Gerald Schroeder argued in detail that there is no contradiction to be\nfound between the account of creation as described in Genesis and the current scientific dic-\ntum.”° Moreover, as Schroeder noted, “the Ramban ... had the remarkably modern insight\nthat at the moment after creation, all the matter in the universe must have been concentrated\nin a tiny speck.””” Tell me that this insight is not identical to that reached by Lemaitre?\nI hope no one will now think that I, personally, believe that Creation as described in\nGenesis is a veiled description of the Big Bang since, as I hope to demonstrate in a future\nwork, Ihave an entirely different theory to propose concerning the shedding of light by",
