In neo-Platonist philosophy, for instance,\nKronos/Saturn was associated with the pole.'\u201d Orphic thought also identified Chronos who,\nas we shall see, was the same as Kronos, as the power behind the turning of the heavens\naround the polar axis.'\" It is therefore no surprise that, when praying, the ancient Greeks,\ntoo, faced to the north. =\nIn time, the sacredness of the north was bound to touch terrestrial realms which, in Euro-\npean thought, remained philologically bound to Saturn through Kronos. The Greeks them-\nselves referred to the North Sea as Kronios Okeanos, or the Saturnian Sea.'\u00ae The adjective\n\u201cCronian,\u201d derived from \u201cKronos,\u201d has even survived in the English language as descriptive\nof the Arctic Ocean.'*\nAs Warren discovered, the same idea persisted in Etruria, before Rome:\n\u201cVarro and other Latin writers confirm this general representation, so that all modern\nexpounders of the old Etruscan religion unite in locating the abode of the gods of\nEtruria in the Centre of Heaven, the northern circumpolar sky. Niebuhr and other au-\nthorities of the highest rank assure us that the Romans shared the same faith.\u201d'*\nThus, Ovid, in his Fasti, offers a description of Creation, at the conclusion of which Janus\nis made to state: \u201cThe guardianship of this vast universe is in my hands alone, and none but\nme may rule the wheeling pole.\u201d * As Roger Ashton indicated:\n\u201cThe centre of the wheeling pole is motionless to the terrestrial observer. Janus, ruler\nof the motionless celestial pole, must thus be located at the Celestial Pole.\u201d 197\nWhen Saturnus was flung down from his celestial seat, he was said to have continued\nruling from \u201cthe opposite end of the world axis,\u201d\"* which presupposes a former position cor-\nresponding to the northern polar station. But even here, we do not really require such a cir-\ncuitous route to the Latin Saturn\u2019s former polar placement since Saturnus himself was re-\nmembered as the god of \u201cthe steadfast star,\u201d\u2019\u201d which star is understood as the Pole Star.",

    "content": "\nSINTERKLAAS\nThe belief in the northern placement of the Saturnian sun perpetuated itself down through\nthe ages in various mystic societies and other traditions in which Saturn continued to be re-\nmembered as \u201cthe old man who lives at the north pole.\u201d \u00ae If this has a familiar ring to it, the\nreader is not mistaken. In fact, as Manly Hall observed:\n\u201cSaturn, the old man who lives at the north pole, and brings with him to the children\nof men a sprig of evergreen (the Christmas tree), is familiar to the little folks under\nthe name Santa Claus.\u201d\nTo be sure, Santa Claus can be said to have had an entirely different origin, one that\nstemmed from the life of Nicholas of Myra. While the history of Nicholas is somewhat ob-\nscure, his cult became a very popular one in Christian circles. What is known of him is that\nhe was the bishop of Myra, in Lycia, a region in present-day Turkey, during the time of the\nRoman emperor Diocletian (A.D. 245-313). Persecuted and tortured for his Christian faith,\nNicholas was then imprisoned until released during the tolerant reign of Constantine. Sancti-\nfied by the Christian Church, he was honored by Latins as well as Greeks by an annual feast\nheld on December 6th.\nNicholas\u2019 connection with the myth of Santa Claus arose out of the legend which claims\nthat he was once responsible for clandestinely bestowing dowries to three daughters of a poor\ncitizen who, not having been able to procure decent marriages for them, was about to give\nthem up to a house of prostitution. This event inaugurated the tradition of giving presents in\nsecret on the eve of his feast day, that is on December Sth.\nThe name Santa Claus itself is merely the English corruption of the Dutch form of Saint\nNicholas\u2014that is Sinterklaas\u2014which transpired when the tradition was introduced to Amer-\nica by early Dutch colonists.\nThere is, of course, no direct connection between Saint Nicholas and the north pole in\nwhich Santa Claus is said to reside. So how did the belief originate?\nThe date of Jesus\u2019 birth has never been ascertained (and it never will be). The Christian\nfeast commemorating the event had originally shifted to and fro all over the calendar. Some-\nwhere around 354 A.D., Latin Christians decided on December 25th since this had been the\ndate on which the feast of Mithra, whose religion had become the main competitor of the\nChristian one, and which had been amalgamated with that of Sol Invictus, was held. This\nraised dissent among the Christian community of other countries, especially among the Syr-\nians and Armenians, who continued to celebrate the birth of Jesus on whatever day their own\ntradition had dictated. In A.D. 440, however, the Fathers of the Christian Church decided to\nrevert to December 25th as the official date since this was also the day of the winter solstice\nwhich had for long been a day of celebration.'\u201d This was also the time during which the feast\nof Saturn, known as the Saturnalia, was celebrated. Originating as a New Year festival, the\nSaturnalia was held on December 17th, but was gradually extended to seven days up to\nDecember 23rd.'\u201d The Greek, and original, version of the Roman Saturnalia, however, was\nthe Greek Kronia, likewise dedicated to Kronos/Saturn, and this used to be held on December",

And it is the collective\nstrength of such traditions, ranging all the way from Sumero/Babylonian times to the present,\nthat impels one to believe that, as far as our ancient forefathers were concerned, the primeval\nsun god had once inhabited that place in Earth\u2019s northern sky that is presently occupied by\nthe Pole Star. Although all this might be new to the public-at-large, I am not revealing an\nthe Pole Star. Although all this might be new to the public-at-large, I am not revealing any,\nesoteric secrets. Mythologists have known it all for quite some time. Gerald Massey,\u201d\nWilliam Warren,\u201d Zelia Nuttal, \"Uno Holmberg,\u2019\u201d Ren\u00e9 Guenon,\u2122 and others we have\nalready had occasion to mention as well as those mentioned below \u2014they all wrote extensive\nworks bearing on the subject. As David Talbott noted:\n\u201c,..the tradition of a former polar god or polar sun has been chronicled by a host of\nscholars; together they have succeeded in demonstrating a universal tradition. In the\nlate nineteenth century John J. O\u2019Neill'\u201d even recognized the god as Saturn and had\nto contrive a distinction between the god and the planet to account for the identity.\nLater, the specific connection of the planet [Saturn] with the Pole was noted by\nL\u00e9opold de Saussure. But not one of these innovative researchers ever wondered if\ntheir polar suns or polar gods might have actually been there!\"\u2122\nGiorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend are prime among those who have re-\nsearched the subject, but have objected to a literal interpretation of what these ancient mes-\nsages portray. Since their own research took them far and wide across the entire world in\ndigging through the mytho-historical record, they had no option but to accept that, as far as\nthe ancients were concerned, Saturn had once resided in the place now occupied by the Pole\nStar. \u201cThis is puzzling at first,\u201d they state.\u201d \u201cWhat has Saturn, the far-out planet, to do with\nthe pole?\u201d they ask.\" They even admit that \u201cthe reader is not the first to be perplexed by an\nimagery which allows for the presence of planets at the pole...\u201d\"* And then comes the ob-\njection: \u201cIt is not in the line of modern astronomy to establish any link connecting the planets\nwith Polaris, or with any star, indeed, out of reach of the members of the zodiacal system.\u201d \u2122\nSo how do they explain the ancient belief in Saturn\u2019s former polar placement? Their answer\nis that \u201csuch figures of speech were an essential part of the technical idiom of archaic astrol-\nogy...\u201d Nowhere, however, do they tell us what it was that gave rise to these \u201cfigures of\nspeech.\u201d Nowhere do they tell us why \u201csuch figures of speech\u201d were thought to be",
