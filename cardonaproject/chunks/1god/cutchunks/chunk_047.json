    "content": "\nKON TIKI VIRACOCHA\nIn South America, myths of the primeval darkness are quite widespread. As H. Os-\nborne noted:\n\u201cSome mythological cycles feature a primitive age of darkness before the ex-\nistence of the sun, when human beings lived in a state of anarchy without the\ntechniques of civilized life.\u201d\u201d\nIna similar vein, Juan de Betanzos narrates the following:\n\u201cThey say that in ancient times the land of Peru was dark and there was no\nlight nor day in it. In those times there dwelt there a certain people who owed\nallegiance to an overlord whose name they no longer remember. And they say\nthat in those times when all was night in the land there came forth from a lake\nin the district called Collasuyu, a Lord named Con Ticci Viracocha...And\nwhile he was there...he suddenly made the sun and the day and commanded\nthe sun to follow the course which it does follow...They say that this Con\nTicci Viracocha had emerged on an earlier occasion and that on this first ap-\npearance he made the heaven and the earth and left everything dark.\u201d*\u00b0\nSimilarly, an account by Sarmiento de Gamboa states that:\n\u201cThe natives of this country [i.e., Peru] say that in the beginning, before the\nworld was created, there was one whom they called Viracocha. And he cre-\nated the world dark and without the Sun, nor Moon, nor stars.\u201d*!\n\u201cThe Sun, according to Sarmiento\u2019s narrative,\u201d Jan Sammer informs us, \u201cemerged\nonly after the Deluge.\u201d\nIt seems, then, that even the famous Kon Tiki (Con Ticci) was none other than a Sat-\nurnian figure, and the \u201clake\u201d from which it was said he emerged nothing but the dim memory\nof the ancient waters of chaos. The description of this god as a fair-skinned, red-bearded man\nhas captured the imagination of western chroniclers but, among the original natives, this be-\nlief was not unanimous. Besides, that Viracocha was a celestial deity is ascertained by his\nhaving been lauded as \u201cThou who art in the high heavens...\u201d\nAlso:",
