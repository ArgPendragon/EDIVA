It is one thing to hypothesize, but quite another to uphold the hypothesis\u2014at\nleast Lemaitre had general relativity on which to rely. In this respect, David Leveson was\nshrewd enough to note: \u201cIn scientific as opposed to pseudo-scientific polemic, evidence has\npriority over hypothesis,\u201d adding that \u201chypothesis must conform to evidence, not evidence to\nhypothesis.\u201d And he goes on with: \u201cIf evidence contrary to a given hypothesis is found, the\nhypothesis must (or should) be altered or rejected.\u201d But then he was astute enough to warn\nthat: \u201cThis does not mean that when contrary evidence is found the hypothesis is immediately\nrejected; it may be retained tentatively in the hope that further evidence may eventually\nexplain the \u2018contrary\u2019 evidence in terms of the theory.\u201d\u201d* As he also pointed out:\nexplain the \u2018contrary\u2019 evidence in terms of the theory.\u201d\"\"* As he also pointed out:\n\u201cIndeed, many hypotheses are arrived at intuitively, through a \u2018flash of insight,\u2019 and\nmay be maintained in the mind of the investigator in spite of much initial \u2018contrary\u2019\nevidence, and later be vindicated ... But a legitimate researcher will not consciously\nsuppress contrary evidence. Certainly he will not publish a hypothesis until he has\nsatisfied himself that all the available evidence is in accord with it. Indeed, if he is\nproperly conscientious, he will search for contrary evidence to test the validity of his\nideas. Hypothesis may precede evidence in time but not in importance.\u201d\u201d\u201d\nThese are guidelines that will be kept in mind as we attempt to unravel the lost history of\nour Solar System in the pages that follow. But, even so, the question must be asked: What\nconstitutes evidence? As Daniel Trifiletti noted:\n\u201cThe very nature of evidence changes from one discipline of science to another. What\nis evidentiary to one person is excluded by another. Facts are not the same for every-\none. Since we cannot all agree as to what constitute \u2018facts,\u2019 deductive arguments\nalone can never be fully convincing...\n\u201cThere is another approach, however, for assessing what might be considered\n\u2018dubious\u2019 by some. That recourse is inductive reasoning. Let it be recognized that no\nfact stands alone, but is part of a whole constellation of other facts. At some point,\nwhen enough facts have been collected, each individual point of light may be seen as\npart of a newly recognizable figure\u2014an organic whole. Eventually the sheer weight\nof even \u2018dubious\u2019 facts becomes too large to ignore.\u201d\u2122\nTHE HISTORICITY OF THE EVENTS\nCan it, however, be assumed that the events portrayed in myths have any factual basis\none way or the other? Many a past mythologist has been vociferous in denying that any his-\ntoricity can be discerned in mythic content. Most mythologists continue to believe that myth,\non the one hand, deals with religious, that is moral, precepts presented in allegorical form,\nand, on the other hand, with such fabulous events that no scientifically-minded modern per-\nson can accept. Conrad Hyers, a professor of religion, to name but one, has written profusely",

In attempting to dissect the Old Testament Book of Genesis, he has stressed\nthat \u201cthe authors were concerned with using these stories as instances of various theological\nand ethical truths.\u201d\u201d' As he had it stated, the \u201cprimary function of great myths and legends is\nnot that of offering explanations;\u201d\u2122\u201d they \u201care not concerned with providing a miscellany of -\nnot that of offering explanations;\u201d\u2122\u201d they \u201care not concerned with providing a miscellany of\ninformation or ready-made answers.\u201d\u201d \u201cThey were,\u201d according to Hyers, \u201cunderstood as\nvehicles of the most basic and important truths of all by which people organized, regulated,\nand interpreted their lives, and through which they saw meaning, purpose, and value in their\nexistence.\u201d \u201cMyths and legends,\u201d he goes on, \u201ctogether with rituals, provided the overar-\nching frame of reference within which to live and experience and celebrate the world.\u2019\u201d\u2122 In a\nway, I could not have put it better myself. Where I disagree with him is when he states that\n\u201cto dwell on the historicity of the accounts, even only an historical core, is to stray from the\npurposes of the writings.\u201d He goes on with: \u201c[The accounts in Genesis] are not aimed at\nproviding a \u2018truer\u2019 picture of the universe or of human history, let alone the only true picture,\nin the modern scientific or historical senses of true.\u201d\u201d\u201d Personally, I refuse to be dubbed a\nfundamentalist,\u201d but I must also state that Hyers\u2019 disclaimer is mainly due to the fact that he\ndoes not understand what historical truths lie hidden within the pages of Genesis, a work\nwhich will hold a place of great importance in the pages to follow.\nMircea Eliade who, in his faltering way, has done more for comparative mythology than\nany other mythologist of the past, was of a slightly different opinion. To him, religious rites\nconsisted in \u201cthe repetition of an archetypal action performed in illo tempore (before\n\u201chistory\u201d began) by ancestors or by gods ... \u201d\u201d\n\u201cBy its repetition, the act coincides with its archetype, and time is abolished. We are\nwitnessing, so the speak, the same act that was performed in illo tempore, at the dawn\nof the universe.\u201d\u2122\nOf course this depends on what one means by \u201chistory.\u201d If, by that term, one is to under-\nstand \u201cwritten history,\u201d then Eliade is correct. If, however, by \u201chistory\u201d we mean \u201cthe story\nof mankind,\u201d Eliade could not have been correct. This becomes of great importance when\none considers what else Eliade had to say about this subject. Thus, toward the end of the\nwork being cited, he states that:\n\u201cEvery ritual, and every meaningful act that man performs, repeats a mythical\narchetype; and ... this repetition involves the abolition of profane time and placing of\nman in a magico-religious time which has no connection with succession in the true\nsense, but forms the \u2018eternal now\u2019 of mythical time.

But note that the majority of myths, simply because they record\nwhat took place \u2018in illo tempore,\u2019 themselves constitute an exemplar history for the\nhuman society in which they have been preserved, and for the world that society lives\nin. Even the cosmogonic myth is history, for it recounts all that took place ab origine;\nbut we must, I need hardly say, remember that it is not \u2018history\u2019 in our sense of the\nword\u2014things that took place once and will never take place again ... \u201d\u2122\"\nDespite the fact that I shall be relying heavily on Eliade\u2019s scholarly insights in the pages\nthat follow, it is precisely here that I must part company with him because, as | aim to illus-\ntrate, the events narrated in myth did take place. They took place not \u201coutside history,\u201d as he\nmaintained, but within history. And by \u201chistory\u201d I do mean \u201c\u2018history\u2019 in our sense of the\nword.\u201d Moreover, Eliade claimed that even the cosmogonic myth is history, whereas I main-\ntain that all myth is cosmogonic in origin. The \u201chistory\u201d / am speaking of, therefore, is a\ncosmogonic history, one that unfurled across the sky and touched Earth and its inhabitants\nwith a mighty finger that has left the human psyche scarred unto this day. The events that the\nmajor myths of the world narrate actually took place, and they took place very much in the\nway the myths narrate.\nWhat, then, is myth?\nI cannot for the life of me remember who said it, but someone, somewhere, once stated\nthat myth constitutes the fossilized memory of man. Truer words have rarely been spoken.\nBut this fossilized memory betokens a knowledge, a remembrance, of what once took place\nin heaven and, in that respect, it can safely be stated that myth constitutes the history of the\nSolar System.\nHere I can best illustrate the above by repeating a story that was well known to the an-\ncient Greeks. The story involves the god Helios\u2014usually identified as the personification of\nthe Sun*\u2019\u2014who was believed to drive his flaming chariot across the sky. When, once, He-\nlios told his son Phaethon that he could ask him for any boon, Phaethon replied by asking to\nbe allowed to drive his father\u2019s chariot. At first Helios, repenting of his oath, tried to dissuade\nPhaethon by stressing the dangers involved in driving the chariot. But, when Phaethon in-\nsisted, Helios, having given his word, was left with no recourse but to give in to his son.\nPhaethon, still in the pride of his youth, leaped into the chariot, took reins in hand, and began\non his journey. The steeds drawing the chariot, however, felt that the weight they were carry-\ning was too light and they leaped into the air as if the car was empty. This occasioned them to\nleave their usual well-beaten path, and Phaethon, who lacked his father\u2019s expertise, panicked,\nand, in trying to correct his erroneous course across the sky, pulled this way and that way at\nthe reins, confusing the horses further. Losing control of the chariot, Phaethon ended up\ndriving it too close to Earth with the result that Earth\u2019s moisture was dried up by the heat of\nthe chariot and, in due course, Earth caught fire and came close to being annihilated by the\nconflagration. In the end, Zeus himself was forced to intervene. Sending forth one of his ter-\nrible thunderbolts, he smote Phaethon with its might, shattering the chariot and freeing the\nhorses. The fragments of the wrecked car were scattered and Phaethon himself, with flames",

It was on the way from the airport that Peiser first in-\nformed us of the above revelation. He also told us, however, that while astronomers had\ncome around to seriously consider terrestrial catastrophism as having possibly been caused\nby asteroidal and cometary impacts, they were still adamant in their denial concerning the\npossibility of planetary catastrophism within the historical, and man\u2019s prehistoric, past. Not\nonly that, Peiser, who seems to have no use for planetary catastrophism himself, also warned\nus that the persistence of belief in planetary \u201cbilliards\u201d can only prove a hindrance to the\neventual acceptance of cosmic catastrophism. Peiser sees this face-about by astronomers and\ntheir allies as a positive step forward. As I told him then, unless planetary catastrophism was\nalso to be embraced as a valid possibility, at best the step in question can only be seen as be-\ning sideways.\nThe present state of affairs was uniquely displayed at the Second SIS Cambridge Confer-\nence, held in July 1997 at Fitzwilliam College, in Cambridge, in which the work of the as-\ntronomers Victor Clube and Bill Napier received quite a boost.
