This \u201cfossilized\u201d magnetism\noccurs when iron-bearing rocks are molten and then quickly cool, thus trapping the orienta-\ntion of Earth\u2019s field at the time of cooling. Known as paleomagnetism, the orientation of the\nfield can be deduced if and when the original position of such rocks can be determined. If,\nthen, the age of such rocks can also be deduced, the orientation of the field, and so the local-\nity of the old geomagnetic poles, can also be dated. When this was accomplished, it became\nevident that the geomagnetic poles must have wandered over the terrestrial surface. More\nimportantly, the parameters enumerated above allows the path of the magnetic pole to be\ntraced through the ages and plotted on a map. Jean Andrews, among others, was able to trace\nthis path for the past 180 million years which she dutifully plotted on just such a map.4\nAndrews\u2019 research led her to the conclusion that \u201cthe whole earth (or at least the mantle\nand the overlying lithospheric plates)\u201d has (or have) tumbled.\u00b0> The cause for this, according\nto her, is the same geoid highs offered earlier by Anderson which cause an imbalance due to\nmass redistribution on Earth\u2019s surface.*\u00b0 This mechanism, which had been offered by others\nbefore her,*\u2019 is explained by Andrews through the following analogy:\n\u201cImagine a homogeneous plastically deformable sphere rotating in space. A dot is\npainted at the rotation axis, the sphere\u2019s north pole. If a bug placed on the equator\ncrawls sufficiently slowly (with respect to the time scale of plastic deformation) to-\nward the dot at the pole, it will in fact never leave the equator defined by the spin\naxis. Rather, the sphere will tumble, with the dot moving toward the bug, while the\nrotation axis remains fixed in space.\u201d 8\nOf course, following Anderson, Andrews was sure to note that Earth is not a homogene-\nous sphere while the equatorial bulge would tend to stabilize Earth and keep it from tum-\nbling. As she herself, however, retorts: \u201cNevertheless, the pole can shift through a large\nangle, even with only a small mass redistribution, as long as the bulge is \u2018plastic\u2019 and not\n\u2018frozen\u2019.\u201d\u00b09\nAndrews\u2019 findings delivered such an impact that the editors of Scientific American pre-\nsented her hypothesis as fact.60 Even so, the question has to be asked: What is the cause of\ngeoid highs and mass redistribution? What causes these areas of higher density? Together\nwith his colleagues, R. Sabadini is of the opinion that mass redistribution is the result of\nmantle flow instabilities,\u00b0! which is not really saying much.\nOf more importance to our own hypothesis, however, is the actual path of the magnetic\npole traced by Andrews for the last 180 million years.

All three of them, as well\nas the rest, are within the Arctic Circle\u2014that is these ancient magnetic poles were already\nwithin the Arctic Circle at the times supplied by Andrews. So that, even if her plotting is\ncorrect, all this pole-wandering would still not resolve the problem concerning the existence\nof sub-tropical faunal and floral remains within the High Arctic regions. As with Hapgood\u2019s\nearlier paths, the most extensive of these polar wanderings would merely have shifted the\nlatitude of Winnipeg close to that of Ellesmere Island. Somehow, I cannot see crocodiles,\nlemurs, and palm trees thriving in the present latitude of Winnipeg. Thus, as with other\ntheories of polar wandering, these pole shifts would still have fallen short of moving sub-\ntropical areas into the Arctic Circle.\n\nAnd then, how valid is a theory based on the hypothesized link between Earth\u2019s\ngeomagnetic pole and its axis of rotation? As already noted, Earth\u2019s geomagnetic pole is\nseparated from its axis of rotation by 11\u00b0. Nor is it even fixed\u2014it wanders around. In Jupi-\nter\u2019s case, the tilt of its south pole does coincide with its geomagnetic one; but at the north\npole, the geomagnetic and spin axes vary by 10\u00b0. That of Uranus is tilted a walloping 59\u00b0\nfrom the planet\u2019s axis of rotation.\u00a9? This was at first thought to be due to the fact that Uranus\nis tilted on its side. Neptune, however, is not lying on its side and yet its magnetic field is\nalso tilted a walloping 47\u00b0 from its axis of rotation. \u00a9 It cannot therefore be an inviolable law\nthat geomagnetic poles should coincide with, or otherwise be linked to, geographic ones, that\nis axes of rotation. True, Saturn\u2019s magnetic field is closely aligned with its spin axis\u2014being\nseparated by less than 1\u00b0\u2014but this seems to be unique among the planets of the Solar Sys-\ntem. Moreover, Saturn\u2019s magnetic field is stronger at the north pole than at the south (0.69\ngauss as opposed to 0.53 gauss), which is equivalent to the centre of the field being displaced\n2400 km north along the planet\u2019s axis. (Whether the anomaly of this magnetic field has\nmeaning for the thesis proposed in this work remains to be seen.)\n\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field is said to be produced by a dynamo effect involving its molten\ncore within the rapidly spinning planet. This mechanism, however, only seems to work in\nEarth\u2019s case. The core of a small planet like Mercury, for instance, would have cooled off\nlong ago; its spin is nearly 60 times slower than Earth\u2019s. For these reasons, Mercury was be-\nlieved not to have a magnetic field. And yet, as it was ultimately discovered, it does. As\nClark Chapman was forced to state: \u201cIn the case of Mercury, more than a decade of subse-\nquent thinking about Mariner 10\u2019s discoveries has still not yielded a clear understanding of\nwhat\u2019s going on inside the planet.\u201d\n\nOnly in the case of Mercury?\u2014one might ask. Take the case of Venus, for instance: If a\nslow spinning planet with a cold core, like Mercury, can generate a magnetic field, then Ve-\nnus, much larger and with molten iron in its core, should, despite its slow spin, also generate\na magnetic field. How is it then that its magnetic field is close to being non-existent?\n\nMars does not only have a weak magnetic field, it is said to be fading. At first, this mag-\nnetic field was thought to swing wildly from one spot to another so that future \u201cBoy Scouts\non Mars won\u2019t be able to use compasses to get around...\u201d But it was later discovered that the\npattern of the detected magnetism, imbedded in surface rocks, is not so jumbled after all.\nMore than that, the magnetism in these rocks is said to be \u201c40 times stronger than similar ar-",

Why then is its present planet-\nwide magnetic field 1/500th the size of Earth\u2019s?\u00ae\nThese anomalies have led Michael Zeilik to state that the entire concept is \u201ca magnetic\nmess.\u201d6\u00b0 Or, as David Stevenson was honest enough to confess: \u201cplanetary dynamo theorists\nhave yet to be able to predict anything about planetary magnetism...\u201d7\u00b0 Up until the early\n1980s, the verdict of NASA authorities was that the \u201cnature of the source of planetary mag-\nnetic fields still remains one of the principal unsolved problems of geophysics.\u201d7! To date,\nnothing new has emerged to invalidate this verdict.\nThe problem here is that if planets follow the same law, why such a potpourri of mag-\nnetic fields? If the dynamo theory cannot account for the magnetic field of all the planets, on\nwhat grounds can it be theorized that it accounts for that of Earth?\nIn the end it can safely be said that what Andrews really plotted was the positions of past\ngeomagnetic poles. Can it positively be surmised that these past positions ever coincided\nwith Earth\u2019s axis of rotation?\nBesides, as is well known, and as noted above, Earth\u2019s present magnetic pole is even now\nwandering on its own. So what need have we of crustal slippage to account for past magnetic\npolar wandering?\nTHE MARTIAN ARCHETYPE\nIn presenting his own version of polar wandering, Don Anderson had also drawn atten-\ntion to the other planets of the Solar System\u201d and zeroed in on Mars. He discussed what he\ntermed the \u201clargest known positive gravity anomaly on any planet\u201d which is associated with\nthe Tharsis volcanic area on Mars. According to received opinion, this mass anomaly has\nserved to reorient the planet with respect to its spin axis.\u201d Almost two years later, Peter\nSchultz took up the topic in the pages of Scientific American.\nAmong other matters, Schultz pointed to ancient networks on the Martian surface which\nare believed by some to have been cut by running water and flowing mud, which suggests a\nwarm climate. And yet these areas are found within 10\u00b0 of the southern polar ice cap. This\nparadox, says Schultz, \u201ccan be resolved by one simplifying hypothesis, namely that the ori-\nentation in space of the Martian crust has not always remained the same throughout geologic\ntime\u2014that the crust has shifted with respect to the planet\u2019s axis of spin.\u201d 74\n\u201cTf such is the case, the north and south poles (the points where the spin axis inter-\nsects the surface) would appear to have wandered over the planet\u2019s crust; certain re-\ngions of the crust that are now far from the poles would at some time in the past have\nbeen within the polar regions...[Thus] the Martian equivalent of plate tectonics might",

Suffice it to say that Schultz, as also Lutz, were\nsatisfied that polar wandering had indeed taken place on Mars.\u2122 As Schultz stated in conclu-\nsion: \u201cThe hypothesis that the Martian poles have wandered is supported by a good deal of\nevidence, and it offers new explanations for many of the planet\u2019s enigmatic features.\u201d85\nWhat was the mechanism offered by Schultz to account for this Martian polar wandering?\nThe mechanism he offered was a reversion to Anderson\u2019s proposed method concerning \u201cthe\nredistribution of mass within a planet or on its surface.\u201d8 His supposition is that: \u201cThe sta-\nblest alignment for a spinning object is the one in which the most massive parts of the object\nare farthest from its axis or rotation.\u201d87\n\u201cWhen geologic forces place a large mass at or near a planet\u2019s surface at a point far\nfrom the equator, the spinning motion of the planet becomes unstable, like the un-\nstable motion of an improperly balanced bearing or top. If the planet is not entirely\nrigid, the crust shifts to move the anomalous mass toward the equator. As the crust of\nthe planet shifts, the spin axis retains its alignment in space and the poles wander over\nthe planet\u2019s surface.\u201d 88\nEven so, Schultz was astute enough to submit a caveat:\n\u201cIf the lithosphere of the planet is very flexible, polar wandering does not take place,\nbecause any excess mass sinks into the surface before the crust has had time to rea-\nlign itself. There can be no polar wandering on a completely rigid planet either, be-\ncause the lithosphere cannot realign itself at all.\u201d89\nThis, then, would seem to invalidate Anderson\u2019s theory re the cause behind terrestrial\nwandering as discussed above and with which we are actually concerned. The case of Mars is\nsomewhat different in that the planet\u2019s lithosphere displays both rigid and flexible features.\nThere are ancient lava-filled basins that have been partly isostatically compensated together\nwith volcanic and tectonic regions which have not been compensated at all. Schultz\u2019s own\nconclusion, as it applies to Mars, is that the \u201cchange in mass distribution that is necessary to\nproduce polar wandering could have been provided by convection in the mantle (the rising of\nhot sections and the sinking of colder ones), by a redistribution of mass due to the impact of\nlarge objects or by the filling with lava of the resulting impact basins.\u201d\n\u201cConvection in the mantle\u201d would not, however, induce polar wandering on Earth for the\nsimple reason that, as Schultz himself warned, \u201cany excess mass\u201d thus produced would tend",
