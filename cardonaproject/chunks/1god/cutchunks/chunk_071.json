    "content": "\nChapter 21\nThe Axis Mundi\nTHE RUACH\night at the very beginning of the Book of Genesis it is stated that, when eretz\n(translated as \u201cearth\u201d) was still in the age of darkness, before the commencement of\nCreation, \u201cthe spirit of Elohim moved upon the face of the waters.\u201d! As we have seen,\nthe deity named Elohim is to be understood as a personification of the planet Saturn. We\nhave also seen that the waters referred to were celestial in nature and that these can perhaps\nbe best understood as a circumstellar cloud surrounding the proto-planet in question. What,\nthen, could it mean that the spirit of Saturn moved over the face of these waters?\nThe Hebrew word translated as \u201cspirit\u201d is ruach, a word which has the additional mean-\ning of \u201cwind.\u201d We find the same situation in Arabic, as also in Maltese, where the words for\n\u201cspirit,\u201d or \u201csoul,\u201d and \u201cwind\u201d share the same linguistic root: rih for \u201csoul\u201d and/or \u201cspirit,\u201d\nrih for \u201cwind.\u201d And, in fact, the Hebrew Talmud does not \u201cconceive\u201d of ruach as God\u2019s\nspirit, but as God\u2019s wind.2 True, Louis Ginzberg warns that this was \u201ccertainly\u201d due \u201cto an\nanti-Christian tendency, since the Christians identified God\u2019s spirit with the Holy Ghost\u201d\nwith which the Jews do not comply. Perhaps. There is no denying, however, that ruach is the\nusual word used for \u201cwind\u201d in the entire Old Testament, including Genesis. It therefore\nseems more probable that the reason ruach was translated as \u201cspirit\u201d in the second verse of\nthis particular Book stems from the fact that the \u201cspirit\u201d of Elohim (usually translated as\n\u201cGod\u201d) seemed to make better sense than \u201cwind\u201d to those who had lost the original meaning\nbehind the verse. James Strong additionally tells us that ruach can also be interpreted as\n\u201cwhirlwind,\u201d4 a datum we shall not lose track of.\nWe find the same idea expressed in the Gnostic words of the Sethians according to\nHippolytus: \u201cNow from the water there has come, as a first derivative principle, a fierce and\nviolent wind which is the cause of all generation.\u201d5\nOut of Indic lore comes an echo of the same phenomenon. As related in the Hymn of Na-\nrayana, this being, elsewhere considered \u201cThe Primal Lord,\u201d had \u201csat above\u201d in \u201ceternal\nsolitary shade,\u201d in \u201cimpenetrable gloom,\u201d before \u201cthings unexisting to existence sprung.\u201d We\nthus recognize Narayana as a manifestation of the primeval Saturnian god. It is then said that\na \u201cprimordial wind\u201d breathed gently over the \u201cvast expanse.\u201d\u00a9\nSimilarly, a Buddhist myth relates how the surface of the cosmic waters was \u201cstirred by\nRe at the very beginning of the Book of Genesis it is stated that, when eretz\nthe dawn wind of creation.\u201d\u201d",

But\nwhat was this whirlwind, this spirit, or soul, that seems to be so intimately connected with\ntraditions of Creation?\nSANCHONIATHON\u2019S COSMOGONY\nWe turn next to Phoenician, that is Canaanite, mythology. According to Sanchoniathon:\n\u201cThe beginning of all things was a dark and condensed windy air, or a breeze of thick air, and\na chaos, turbid and black as Erebus; and these were unbounded, and for a long series of ages\ndestitute of form.\u201d!\u00b0\nThus, as in the mythology of other races, the wind and chaos, the latter of which we have\nalready identified as Saturn\u2019s circumstellar cloud, had always existed.\nSanchoniathon, a Phoenician priest, lived sometime in the 6th or 7th century B. C. He is\nsaid to have copied the sacred inscriptions from the pillars in the temple of Melkart, some say\nof Ba\u2019al Hamon, at Tyre, when these crashed to the ground in an earthquake. His work has\nnot survived in its entirety, but Philo of Byblos, a scholar who was himself a Phoenician, pre-\nserved various excerpts of Sanchoniathon\u2019s work in his own Phoinikika sometime during the\nlast century B.C. As it happened, this work, too, was eventually lost but, once again, frag-\nments from it were discovered and preserved by Eusebius Pamhili, a bishop of Caesarea, Pal-\nestine, in A.D. 314, and incorporated into his own work, Evangelicae Praeparationis.\nAs others before me have stated, and as is obvious from the work itself, in part, San-\nchoniathon\u2019s cosmogony resembles that of the Babylonians while heavily influenced by\nGreek and Jewish sources,!! if not also those of Egypt.!2 Thus, for instance, when he claims\nthat chaos was as \u201cblack as Erebus,\u201d he literally means \u201cdarkness,\u201d Erebus being the dark\nGreek Limbo said to have been situated between Earth and Hades.\nIt might not have been fair for George Cook to state that Sanchoniathon\u2019s cosmogony\ncannot be taken seriously \u201cas an account of genuine Phoenician beliefs.\u201d3 As he himself\nstated:\n\u201cAt the same time Philo [and, therefore, Sanchoniathon] did not invent all the non-\nsense which he has handed down; he drew upon various sources, Greek and Egyptian,\nsome of them ultimately of Babylonian origin, and incidentally, he mentions matters\nof interest which, when tested by other evidence, are fairly well supported. He shows\nat any rate that some sort of a theology existed in his day...\u201d 4",

    "content": "\nWhat seems to have transpired is that, very much like the Greek Hesiod, who had lived a\ncentury before him, to say nothing of other ancient writers, Sanchoniathon collated material\nfrom different sources which he then compiled into a single running narrative through the\nliterary device of genealogical descent. Not wishing to leave any of his data unaccounted for,\nhe seems to have gathered disparate myths which recounted the same events and presented\nthem as different occurrences in a chronological succession.\nAs Sanchoniathon continues:\n\u201cBut when this wind became enamored of its own first principles (the chaos), an in-\ntimate union took place, that connection was called Pothos; and it was the beginning\nof the creation of all things. And it (the chaos) knew not its own production; but from\nits embrace with the wind was generated Mot, which some call Ilus, but others, the\nputrefaction of a watery mixture.\u201d !5\nAs I have attempted to show in a previous chapter, this mot was considered by some as\nslime and, by others, as a rotting of aquatic composition.'\u00a9 As there noted, modern scholars\nhave supported the interpretation of this word as \u201cwater.\u201d !7 But since this celestial water was\nobviously the same, or of the same nature, as the chaos which surrounded proto-Saturn as a\ncircumstellar cloud, it also becomes obvious that this is one of those occasions in which San-\nchoniathon fused two variant readings of the same event into a sequential one. (There are\nothers, but these do not concern us here.)\nAs shown above, Sanchoniathon also claimed that some called Mot by the name Ilus. To\nus, this has interest since, elsewhere, he himself informs us that Ilus was merely the Phoeni-\ncian form of the Greek Cronus!\u00ae (or Kronos), the same as El. Knowing full well by now\nwhom Kronos and El represented, we again come face to face with the association of these\nearly events with the planet Saturn.\nBOREAS\nWe again find this wind associated with a Saturnian deity, in this case Atum, in Egyptian\nmythology. More than that, this wind is there described as having been a north wind, said to\nhave come from Atum.!9 So, likewise, with Ra (or Re), who is beseeched to \u201cinhale the north\nwind.\u201d20 In the Pyramid Texts, this north wind is said to \u201clift up\u201d the deceased king in his\nassimilation to the god.?! A \u201clifting up,\u201d in turn, connotes a support, another datum we shall\nnot lose track of.\nWe meet this same north wind in the mythology of ancient Greece where the entity in\nquestion was anthropomorphosed as Aquilo, more popularly known as Boreas. Although\nGreek mythology encompasses four anthropomorphosed wind entities\u2014Boreas, Zephyros,\nNotus, and Eurus\u2014it is Boreas that holds the centre stage. It is, in fact, from this Greek\nname, through Latin borealis, that the English adjective \u201cboreal\u201d is derived.",

Originally, however,\nBoreas seems to have been envisaged as a being with serpent tails for feet.?\nIt is interesting to note that, in the late third century A.D., Lactantius used Boreas as an\nanalogy of the Sanctus Spiritus which impregnated the virgin mother of Jesus.* As in the\ncase of the Hebrew ruach, this obviously stems from the much more ancient identity of the\nwind as the spirit of Elohim (to say nothing of the entity\u2019s fructifying power, which will be\nexplored in a future volume). In fact, as Donald Mackenzie indicated: \u201c\u2018Wind\u2019 and \u2018breath\u2019\nand \u2018spirit\u2019 were believed by many primitive peoples to be identical.\u201d\nBut, in the main, we note this fact: As a wind associated with Saturn, it is not surprising\nto find this entity linked to the north since that is where ancient tradition places both the Sat-\nurnian planet and its allied deities. We would, on the contrary, have been surprised had this\nnot been reported to have been so. Thus even in much later times, the Hindus were still\nassociating the wind with Dhruva,?5 that is the North Star which, as we noted in an earlier\nchapter, had originally been one of the Sanskrit names for the planet Saturn.",

As in the case of Boreas and his Egyptian counterpart, this\nwould again testify that the source of Ehecatl lay in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole.\nAt Chichen Itza, in Mexico, there is a circular pre-Columbian building which the Ameri-\ncan explorer John Lloyd Stephens named El Caracol\u2014\u201cThe Snail.\u201d This edifice contains an\ninterior spiral staircase which leads to a round observatory oriented to the four cardinal points\nof the compass. As Neil Baldwin explains:\n\u201cThe Snail building is an important signpost on our Plumed Serpent trail for several\nreasons. The round shape of the building links it to the chain of structures throughout\nMesoamerica consecrated to Ehecatl, the Wind God, one of Plumed Serpent\u2019s per-\nsonalities.\u201d3!\nEl Caracol was aptly named since its interior winding staircase is reminiscent of the\ncoiling shell of the snail. We find this same spiral coiling in the outer ramparts of the\nstrangely shaped structure at Calixtlahuaca, which was also dedicated to Ehecatl. Among the\nMaya, this god was known as Kukulkan, one aspect of whom was also that of wind god.*? It\nis thus fitting that, in a curious Maya vase, Kukulkan is symbolically shown emerging from a\nsnail.33 It was, however, the conch shell, rather than the snail, which was intimately\nassociated with Ehecatl. As Tom Lowenstein has it:\n\u201c...in his guise as Ehecatl, the Plumed Serpent [that is, Quetzalcoatl] wore a conch\nshell, his symbolic \u2018jewel of the wind.\u2019 In imitation of their deity himself, priests of",

Many of the temples\ndedicated to Quetzalcoatl were also circular, signifying the eddying of the wind.\u201d34\nThe spiral on the shell of a snail, as well as the interior construction of the conch, both\nsymbolic of Ehecatl as the god of wind,35 are more significant of a whirlwind than an ordi-\nnary breeze. This is so much so that, among the punishments which Quetzalcoatl was be-\nlieved to inflict on the human race were tornadoes and water spouts.3\u00a2 Tornadoes and water\nspouts exhibit a verticality stretching between heaven and Earth, much in the manner exem-\nplified by the various wind entities we have been examining. Thus, for instance, in the Vi-\nenna Codex, Quetzalcoatl-Ehecatl is depicted with arms raised to support the sky.37\nSHU\nThe above cannot but remind us of the Egyptian god Shu, who was said to have flowed\nfrom Ra,38 but by others as having been self-created.39 He was, in effect, the very breath of\nRa. Like Ehecatl, Shu was described, and profusely depicted, as holding up the \u201csky.\u201d4!\nAdditionally, like Boreas, he was also considered to have been the personification of the\nnorth wind.* Rather than separating the celestial waters from the terrestrial ones, as in the\ncase of Ehecatl and Elohim, Shu was said to have separated heaven from Earth.43\nThe very name Shu has been interpreted as \u201cthe uplifter.\u201d4 As the uplifter of heaven, he\nbecomes its support. As Budge informs us, Shu was also considered \u201ca god of light, or light\npersonified.\u201d45 But light in this instance was also \u201cdeclared to be the prop of the sky.\u201d46\nActually, the character of Shu is much more complex than that and, to be sure, he has\nbeen presented here somewhat out of chronological order. We will have much more to say\nconcerning this being in following volumes. I have merely included him here as a link in the\nchain of evidence concerning the nature of the primeval north wind in order to show the near-\nuniversality of this motif.\nThe most popular heaven-sustaining strong-man in the western world, needless to say, is\nthe well-known Greek Atlas. But, because I do not wish to step outside, or beyond, the\nchronological sequence I have been attempting to follow, his treatment, too, must be post-\nponed to a future work.\nIn the meantime, what all the above seems to imply is that this primordial wind was visi-\nble as an illuminated support of the sky within which the Saturnian orb resided. The only\ntype of whirlwind that could be seen to support the sky would have to have been in the form\nof a tornado or water spout, already encountered as one of the punishments inflicted by Quet-\nzalcoatl.",
