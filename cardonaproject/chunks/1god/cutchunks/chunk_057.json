Proto-Saturn has been hypothesized to have been a\nbrown, rather than a red, dwarf star. Brown dwarf stars, however, are actually red; they have\nmerely been designated as brown dwarfs only because the term \u201cred dwarfs\u201d had already\nbeen assigned to their slightly more massive siblings. True, brown dwarfs are said to radiate\nthrough a slightly different process. They are believed to \u201cglow dimly from heat generated by\ngravitational contraction and the fusion of deuterium.\u201d7 (If, as some claim, stars are fueled\nelectrically, however, even this distinction disappears.) In any case, both red and brown\ndwarfs come in various masses, so that the dividing line between them, as that between\nbrown dwarfs and planets, becomes merely arbitrary. If, therefore, life-bearing planets can\norbit red dwarf stars, they can just as easily accompany brown dwarfs. And, to be sure, even\nas the writing of this work progresses, the idea that planets can orbit brown dwarfs is being\nseriously considered.8\nPHASE LOCK\nAs Croswell explained, planetary orbits around dwarf stars \u201cwould come at a price.\u201d?\n\u201cA planet in such a tight orbit would become tidally locked to its star, just as our own\nMoon is locked to Earth. One side would perpetually face the star, while the other\nfaced away.\u201d 10\nWhile this, too, is in keeping with our own hypothesis, it also brings to mind Lynn Rose\u2019s\npostulate, which we contested in an earlier chapter, concerning the nature of Earth\u2019s marriage\nto proto-Saturn. As we saw there, he, too, had posited a similar phase-lock wherein Earth\ndisplayed the same hemisphere toward its primary, but contrary to our axis-sharing hypothe-\nsis. Without thinking to credit Rose, such a phase-lock between Earth and proto-Saturn had\nalso been considered by Frederick Hall who assumed Earth \u201cto have formerly been a nearly\nspherical satellite of Saturn, circling the giant orb in about 28 days, with a slow spin and the\nsame side of the Earth always facing Saturn.\u201d!! As he continued:\n\u201cProto-Saturn is [read \u2018would have been\u2019] vast in comparison to Earth and perhaps\nmuch larger [read \u2018more massive\u2019] than the body we know today. Consider it [to have\nbeen] about the smallest possible red dwarf star or a brown dwarf star...\u201d !2\nHall, however, was also convinced that Earth had shared the same axis of rotation with\nproto-Saturn, with the latter having been permanently located in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole,\nexactly as posited in the present work. How, then, did he reconcile his two opposing views?",

    "content": "\nDespite the mytho-historical evidence, Earth\u2019s axis-sharing lock with Saturn had always\nbeen the most difficult aspect of the Saturn thesis to reconcile with celestial mechan-\nics\u2014which is why Rose could never accept the concept. Hall attempted to resolve the diffi-\nculty by claiming that Earth was originally phase-locked with proto-Saturn before it was torn\naway from its primary during the system\u2019s entry into the Sun\u2019s domain. According to Hall,\nthe \u201cpolar alignment occurred due to a massive gravitational pull on Saturn\u201d which would\nhave left Earth \u201ctrailing after it.\u201d!3 As of this writing, Thornhill, too, is of similar belief. The\n\u201cspectacular Saturnian polar configuration,\u201d according to him, came into being \u201cwhen [proto-\nSaturn\u2019s] planetary system was disrupted by the Sun in a manner similar to that when Jupiter\ndisrupted comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 into a \u2018string of pearls\u2019.\u201d!4 Thus, according to him, the\nSaturnian \u201ccollinear equilibrium...could not have been primordial.\u201d 15\nTo be sure, this is not necessarily a fallacious interpretation and it should not be dis-\nmissed out of hand. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that as far back as man\u2019s memory\ncan reach, the Saturnian sun had always occupied the north celestial pole. What the situation\nmight have been prior to that will be discussed in a later chapter of this work.\nATMOSPHERIC AMPLITUDE\nOne problem inherent in the phase-lock theory involves the amount of heat shed by the\ndwarf star on the orbiting planet\u2019s hemisphere facing it. As Croswell pointed out, \u201cthe day\nside of a red dwarf planet would fry.\u201d!\u00a9 What is perhaps worse is that \u201cthe night side would\nbe so frigid\u201d that the atmosphere itself would be expected to freeze. 17 How could life have\nsurvived such conditions.\nOne way out of this dilemma, according to Croswell, would be to postulate that such a\nplanet\u2019s atmosphere would be \u201csufficiently thick.\u201d !8\n\u201cResearchers [have] calculated that gases circulating in the atmosphere would then be\nable to transport heat from the planet\u2019s day side to its night side, warming the night\nair so that it wouldn\u2019t freeze out.\u201d!9\nSuch transportation of heat from one hemisphere to the other would not only warm the\nplanet\u2019s night side, it would also cool its day side resulting in a balanced heat regime.\nWhat is interesting in this is that the same situation had also been proposed in relation to\nEarth itself. It was in the mid-19th century that the British anatomist, Richard Owen,\ndemanded a denser terrestrial atmosphere, containing elevated concentrations of carbon\ndioxide and reduced oxygen, in order for prehistoric pterodactyls to have been able to fly and\nnavigate.2? Much later, Frederic Jueneman had much to say concerning the inability of\npterodactyls, known to have had wingspans of up to 36 feet, to fly and navigate in Earth\u2019s\npresent sky, and why a denser atmospheric envelope would have been required for such\nflight in prehistoric times.?!",

According to Berner, this was due to \u201cthe rise\nof land plants in general and in particular to the vast and verdant swamps that characterized\nthe Carboniferous.\u201d32\n\u201cAll those swamp plants spit oxygen into the atmosphere, and when they died, they\nescaped the open-air decomposition by bacteria that would have drawn oxygen back\nout of the atmosphere. Instead they sank into the swamps, ultimately forming coal\ndeposits that gave the Carboniferous its name.\u201d33\nNever mind that there is no direct evidence of higher atmospheric oxygen levels during\nthe Carboniferous. After all, Berner\u2019s hypothesis is simply based on a computer model. Even\nso, as Shanti Menon explained, the oxygen-rich atmosphere hypothesized by Berner would\nhave made for \u201ca denser atmosphere that provided more lift and thus made it easier for\n[Carboniferous insects] to fly.\u201d34 While this is in keeping with Jueneman\u2019s Pleiongaea, it\nshould be kept in mind that, as Menon was forced to admit, the whole idea is \u201ca hypothesis\nbased on a hypothesis.\u201d35 But then, around 1985, Dale Russell and Parvez Kumar also came\nto the conclusion that Earth\u2019s atmosphere had to have been much denser than at present.\nBut is a denser atmospheric envelope really required for the sustenance of life on a planet\nreliant for its heat on a dwarf star? Until recently, such a dense atmosphere around a dwarf\nstar planet had been thought to be detrimental to life since it would prevent the star\u2019s rays\nfrom reaching the planet\u2019s surface and thus inhibiting photosynthesis, \u201ca serious blow for the\ndevelopment of life as we know it.\u201d But then, simulation of a red dwarf planet\u2019s\natmosphere conducted by Robert Haberle and Manoj Joshi in the 1990s showed that a thick\nenvelope would not really be required. As they stated, \u201ceven a thin atmosphere would do the\ntrick.\u201d37\n\u201cIf the planet had only 15 per cent as much air as the Earth...that would still ferry\nenough heat around to the dark side to keep the atmosphere from freezing out.\u201d38\nThe density, or otherwise, of a planet\u2019s atmosphere, however, is relative. Even an atmos-\nphere as dense as that of Venus, which has been blamed for its infernal heat, much denser\nthan that proposed for Earth by the above proponents, is not enough to obstruct the Sun\u2019s\nrays. And if pterodactyls and giant insects really required a denser atmosphere in order to fly\nand navigate, we will accept that. After all, the view that Earth was nestled within proto-Sat-\nurn\u2019s envelope is not incompatible with a denser terrestrial atmosphere.\nTHE CRADLE OF LIFE\nKeeping the atmosphere from freezing on the night side of such a planet is one thing,\nkeeping the water, still believed to be the cradle of life, in the same hemisphere from suffer-\ning the same fate is quite another. \u201cEven in some of Joshi and Haberle\u2019s models, there re-\nmained freezing conditions on the planet\u2019s dark side.\u201d At first, this led to something of an",
