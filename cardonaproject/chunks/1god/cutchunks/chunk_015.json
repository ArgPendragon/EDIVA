    "content": "In its slow march across the sky, the Chinese calculated that it takes 28 years for the\nplanet to complete one revolution around the Sun,\u201d which is not too far off the modern value\nof 29.46 years.\n\nThe apparent stoppage and temporary retrograde motion of Saturn along its orbit, which\napplies to all outer planets\u2014that is, those farther away from the Sun than Earth, and therefore\noutside Earth\u2019s orbit\u2014an illusion brought about when Earth overtakes it in its narrower cir-\ncuit, was also calculated by them.\u201d As Gustave Schlegel pointed out, the modern value for\nthis apparent motion \u201cmore or less agrees with the Chinese observation.\u201d\u201d And similarly for\nthe other planets visible to the naked eye.\n\nGUEST STARS\n\nOne particular branch of ancient astronomy that can be said to have been uniquely Chi-\nnese was the record-keeping of what they termed \u201cGuest Stars.\u201d These records documented\nthe temporary blaze of stellar \u201cexplosions,\u201d or flare-ups, which bring usually invisible stars\nto bright perceptibility, an effulgence which persists for a specific, but not usually long, time,\nbefore it wanes and the star again disappears from view. Having once been referred to as\n\u201cnew stars,\u201d these stellar phenomena are now known as novae and supernovae. The most fa-\nmous of such temporary Chinese Guest Stars was the one that took place in 1054 A.D., a su-\npernova that is now believed to have given birth to the Crab Nebula.\n\nTHE SURYA SIDDHANTA\n\nOf Hindu astronomical knowledge I will say nothing beyond a few facts as contained in\nthe Surya Siddhanta which, among other matters, presents the correct view that Earth is a\nsphere. As it is there written: \u201cAnd everywhere upon the globe of the earth, men think their\nown place to be uppermost\u2014 but since it is a globe in the ether, where should there be an up-\nper, or where an under side of it?\u201d* Aryabhatta even held the opinion that Earth revolves on\nits axis.\n\nOne should read the section of the Surya Siddhanta which treats of planetary conjunc-\ntions, that is the apparent contact of one planet with another as seen with the naked eye\nagainst the background of stars, in order to obtain some measure of understanding concerning\nthe painstaking observations and calculations that these early astronomers were capable of. A\ndifferent term is there employed for different conjunctions.* These apparent close ap-\nproaches of planets were correctly understood in a purely angular sense\u2014that is, they were\nquite aware that the planets appeared to touch each other only when they happened to lie in\nthe same line of sight as seen from Earth.\u201d\n\nVelikovsky was thus completely in error when he proposed that these conjunctions re-\nferred to actual physical contacts between planets.\u201d This is evidenced by the work in ques-",

    "content": "tion itself where it is stated that \u201cthe planets move on upon their own paths, approaching one\nanother at a distance.\u201d*\n\nG. Thibaut has claimed that much of what is found contained in the Hindu Siddhantas, of\nwhich there is more than one, is mainly based on the teachings of the Greek Hipparchos\nand/or Ptolemy. Otto Neugebauer and D. Pingree also trace some of this Hindu knowledge to\nthe even older Babylonians. We therefore turn next to Greece and, after that, to Babylon.\n\nTHE ALMAGEST\n\nClaudius Ptolemaeus, popularly known simply as Ptolemy, was the most celebrated geog-\nrapher, mathematician, and astronomer prior to medieval times. More than that, he has often\nbeen referred to as \u201cthe greatest astronomer of antiquity.\u201d Unfortunately, despite some\nArabian traditions concerning his personal appearance and the report that he lived to the ripe\nold age of 78 years, nothing much is known about the man himself. Whether his name,\nPtolemaeus, derived from that of the Greek city in which he was said to have been born,\nPtolemais Hermii, or whether, as Kenneth Heuer assumes, it \u201cindicates that he was an in-\nhabitant of Egypt of Greek or Macedonian [that is, Ptolemaic] descent,\u201d cannot now be as-\ncertained.\n\nWhat seemed to have been certain until recently is that he conducted his astronomical ob-\nservations at Alexandria, in Egypt, sometime during the years 127 and 141 or 151 A.D. The\nbelief among more modern historians of science, however, is that Ptolemy conducted most of\nhis observing \u201cnot at night on the coast of Egypt but during the day in the great library at Al-\nexandria, where he appropriated the work of a Greek astronomer [Hipparchus] and proceeded\nto call it his own.\u201d\n\nOf his works on geography and mathematics, I shall say nothing here, concentrating in-\nstead, and then only briefly, on his astronomical observations and theories. These were pre-\nsented in thirteen books originally titled Syntaxis, but later referred to by the Arabs as Al-\nmagest, which means \u201cThe Greatest,\u201d the name by which the work is now more commonly\nalluded to. For better or worse, this work \u201cwas accepted as the final authority on the subject\nuntil it was superseded by the observations of the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus in\nthe 16th century.\u201d\"\u201d\n\nWhat Ptolemy concluded from his so-called observations of the heavens was that the\nheavenly bodies moved in circular orbits and that Earth, already known by then to be spheri-\ncal in shape, was at the centre of the universe. He calculated the periods of revolution, as well\nas the apparent retrogradation, of the five planets visible to the unaided eye, the inclination of\ntheir orbits, and their motions in latitude. He compiled a catalogue of the stars visible in both\nthe northern and southern hemispheres, listed under constellations, giving their apparent\nmagnitudes, latitudes, and longitudes, which stars numbered 1,022 (some say 1,025) as\ncompared with the 850 or so that were contained in the earlier catalogue of Hipparchus.\n\nMuch of the Almagest is taken up with an explanation of astronomical assumptions and\nmathematical methods; the length of the year and the motion of the Sun; the length of the\nmonth and the motions of the Moon; the sizes and distances of the Sun, the Moon, and Earth\nitself; eclipses of the Sun and the Moon; and the precession of the equinoxes.",

    "content": "\nPtolemy also wrote a text in four books on astrology, the Tetrabiblos, which he compiled\nfrom material culled from Chaldean, Egyptian, Greek, and earlier writings, with which we\nshall also not concern ourselves here. Let not the reader, however, disqualify Ptolemy as an\nincompetent astronomer because of his astrological beliefs. Isaac Newton was not only a be-\nliever in alchemy, he himself attempted to change base metals into silver and gold. '\u00ae\nAs Heuer informed his readers, \u201cPtolemy was not the kind of genius who produced new\nideas; he took existing ideas and changed and extended them in order to obtain agreement\nwith observed facts.\u201d\u2122 There is no doubt, however, that a large part of the theories he\npresents are his own contributions \u201cbased on observations of his own, not to speak of the\nunbelievable number of numerical calculations which underlie the tables of the Almagest.\u201d\"\u00ae\nSome of Ptolemy\u2019s modern defenders have been claiming that his \u201csystem\u201d has been\nmuch misunderstood by astronomers as well as historians of astronomy. As Irving Wolfe\npointed out:\n\u201c...the theory of Ptolemy was not presented in its time as a real picture of the sky.\nAstrophysicist Bruce Gregory reminds us that Ptolemy\u2019s model was not said to be a\nminiature of the Solar System, as we use the word today. It was \u2018a device for\ncalculating the position of the planets, not a device for representing the appearance of\nthe planets.\u2019 Astonishingly, the theory of Copernicus was first presented in the\nsame way, as a system which \u2018might not be the true scheme of nature, but merely a\nmathematical fiction which fitted the observations.\u2019'\u201d Ptolemy\u2019s system, however,\nwas soon elevated to absolute truth, as was Copernicus\u2019 later, so it is we who have\nmade them into religions.\u201d '\u00ae\nMaybe so, even though, to me, this sounds more like an attempt to whitewash Ptolemy\u2019s\nimage. Thus, for instance, those astronomers who have more recently re-examined Ptolemy\u2019s\noriginal data soon realized that retrocalculations of the planets proved that many of\nPtolemy\u2019s so-called observations were wrong. \u201cThe errors were gross even by the standards\nof ancient astronomy.\u201d There is also no longer any doubt that Ptolemy plagiarized the\nwork of the earlier Hipparchus. We have already noted the earlier star catalogue compiled by\nHipparchus who conducted his observations from the island of Rhodes. This Greek island\nlies five degrees of latitude north of Alexandria. This makes for a five-degree band of\nsouthern stars that can be seen from Alexandria but not from Rhodes. Not a single one of the\n1,022 stars that Ptolemy listed in his catalogue is to be found in this five-degree band.\nMoreover, \u201cevery example given in the Almagest of how to work out spherical astronomy\nproblems is given for a latitude the same as that of Rhodes.\u201d!\u201d\nRobert Newton went even further:",
