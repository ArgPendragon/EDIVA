As we have seen, it was only through creation that\nJanus \u201cassumed the face and members of a god.\u201d Similarly, the Egyptian creator was \u201ca\nformless god [who] stood alone in the \u2018waters\u2019 of the sky...a sphere without external \u2018at-\ntributes\u2019 or \u2018limbs\u2019.\u201d*\u00b0\nReturning to Kon Tiki Viracocha, we learn that:\n\u201cIn all the accounts, whatever the regional variations, this hero always ap-\npeared as a god-creator who intervened in a world which was already cre-\nated...but unorganized...Viracocha\u2019s role was therefore to transform chaos\ninto cosmos...\u201d\u00b0>\nMoreover, this myth of the Collao seems to imply that the \u201cearth\u201d which existed prior\nto the creation, or appearance, of light was also considered a creation of Kon Tiki. This belief\nis not to be wondered at for it seems doubtful that man remembers a god older than the Sat-\nurnian figure. But it does seem that he remembers a time when the Sun was not yet apparent\nin the sky. Thus, another myth from the same region explicitly states: \u201cIn the most ancient\ntimes the earth was covered in darkness and there was no sun.\u201d*\u201d The Popul Vuh also relates\nthat before the \u201cearth\u201d was created, \u201cthere was only motionless sea\u201d and \u201cit was night; si-\nlence stood in the dark.\u201d** And again, from a Xingu myth we learn that:\n\u201cIn the beginning it was all dark. It was always night. There was no day.\u201d\u201d\u201d\nTHE ENDLESS SEA\nWe cross the Pacific to the archipelagos of Micronesia where we find that a pre-ex-\nisting \u201crock\u201d was believed to have been the matrix of the \u201cuniverse.\u201d But even this \u201crock of\nages\u201d is \u201cassociated with an endless stretch of original sea\u201d from which the first gods were\nproduced.\u201d The Polynesians also state that, \u201cin the beginning\u201d there was no light. \u201cA brood-",

The nights would be millions in the long night to name; it was\nthe long, wearisome night, the night of Rumia!\u201d>\nWhile this darkness was described as having been primarily in the sky, in which the\ncreator was seen to hover, it does not seem to have restricted itself to the celestial waters.\nSince this darkness was said to have preceded the appearance of the Sun, as is also implied in\nGenesis, it would necessarily mean that the entire sky was immersed in it. Needless to say,\nsuch a darkness could not but have touched Earth and, in fact, many of the myths we have\nalready enumerated more than intimate this. In some instances, the myths themselves actually\nstate as much.\nIt therefore becomes obvious that the age of darkness preceded the time when Saturn\nshone as a true sun. As we have seen, time and again we are told that, during this age of\ndarkness, no Sun, no Moon, no stars were seen. It therefore seems that we are still missing\nsomething crucial. What was it that hid the Sun, the Moon, and the stars from view?\nAnother problem that arises at this point, of course, has to do with life itself. Could\nlife, let alone man, have existed during a protracted period during which Earth would have\nbeen immersed in darkness?",

Even though not yet glorious as a\nsun, Saturn must have still shed some light. And, to be sure, the mytho-historical record is not\nexactly silent on this.\nThe Book of the Secrets of Enoch describes the beginning of Creation in a somewhat\nfuller manner than does the Book of Genesis. It is from its pages that we learn of the uncoil-\ning of Adoil as the very genesis of this process. In the quote that follows, God is describing\nto Enoch the manner in which he created the cosmos:\n\u201cI commanded in the very lowest parts that visible things should come down\nfrom invisible, and Adoil came down very great, and I beheld him, and lo! he\nhad a belly of great light.\n\u201cAnd I said to him: \u2018Become undone, Adoil, and let the visible come out of\nthee.\u2019\n\u201cAnd he became undone...\u201d!\nThe name \u201cAdoil,\u201d also \u201cIdoil,\u201d probably derives from the Hebrew id El, that is\n\u201chand of God\u201d or, more appropriately, \u201chand of El,\u201d? that is Saturn. The coming undone of\nAdoil, meanwhile, presupposes that the planetary deity had originally been tightly coiled,\nwhich is not at odds with our hypothesized nebular cloud. Note, however, that Adoil is\nclaimed to have had \u201ca belly of great light\u201d even before he became undone to release that\nThe Eskimo entity known as Raven, whom we have already identified through the\nrules of comparative mythology as a representation of the Saturnian creator, was also said to\nhave first existed in darkness.

It was still enveloped\nin the nocturnal darkness...[but] the self-born lord, he who achieves all the af-\nfairs of the worlds, moved about like a glow-worm, with a desire to mani-\nfest.\u201d\nWhat we are here told, then, is that not only was the universe\u2014i.e. this\n\u201cAll\u201d \u2014 originally in darkness, but Brahma, whom we have already identified as Saturn, radi-\nated but only feebly, \u201clike a glow-worm.\u201d This is like saying that Saturn\u2019s glow was not\nenough to dissipate the darkness.\nAccording to the Mbay\u00e9:\n\u201c...the First Being [whom they called Namandui and/or the Namandu Fa-\nther]...made darkness.

Nor are microbes the only forms of life that\ncluster around these orifices. In the 1970s, scientists discovered that flues near the Galdpagos\nIslands support a thriving community of bacteria, tube worms, and even clams \u201cwhose pri-\nmary source of energy is not light but sulfur compounds emitted by the vents.\u201d\"\u00b0\n\nTwo large communities thriving in similar sites were discovered in the eastern Pa-\ncific, a few hundred miles from Easter Island, in May 1981 by members of the Woods Hole\nOceanographic Institution and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Apart from bacteria,\nworms, and clams, these communities also contained mussels, starfish and actual fish which\nwere photographed at depths reaching 9,000 feet.

To quote Rachel Carson:\n\u201cFor the darkness of the lower depths has forced many creatures to make their\nown light. Perhaps half of the fishes that live in dimly lit or darkened water, as\nwell as many of the lower forms, are phosphorescent. Many fishes carry\ntorches that can be turned on or off at will, presumably to help them find or\npursue their prey. Others have rows of light over their bodies, in patterns that\nvary from species to species. This may be a sort of recognition mark or badge\nby which the fish can be known as friend or enemy.\u201d\u201d!\nMoreover:\n\u201cDown beyond the reach of even the longest and strongest of the sun\u2019s rays,\nthe eyes of fishes are different. They become enlarged, as though to make the\nmost of any chance light of whatever sort. Or they may be telescopic, large of\nlens, and protruding.
