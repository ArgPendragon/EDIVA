Unfortu-\nnately for this argument, the Sun does eventually set, and it remains absent for the second\nhalf of the year. Besides, while visible during the short summer months, the polar Sun is\nhardly immobile as it circles around the sky above the horizon. In view of what we have al-\nready uncovered concerning the immobility of the primeval Saturn, it is more than obvious\nthat what the Yakut were describing was the dimly remembered Satumian sun. This will be-\ncome all the more apparent in the next chapter when we will throw further light on that ce-\nlestial locality here called \u201cthe still center of the world.\u201d\n\nWhat we have learned in this chapter, therefore, is self-illuminating \u2014that, still according\nto the ancients, and during the time we have been investigating, the planet Saturn not only\nshone as a sun in a sky that was devoid of other astronomical bodies, but, as seen from Earth,\nthis Saturnian sun was seen to neither rise nor set. It seemed, instead, to have radiated down\non mankind while being permanently fixed in one spot.\n\nHow could this have been possible?",

This is precisely the case with our Moon which is in phase-lock with Earth.\nWhat this means is that the Moon rotates on its axis in the same time it takes it to revolve\naround Earth. Thus, as seen from Earth, the Moon always presents the same face to us. The\nother side of the Moon, usually called the far side, is not visible from Earth. (It was revealed\nto Earth-bound eyes for the first time through the photographic capabilities of twentieth\ncentury space-probes.) What this also means is that, as seen from the lunar hemisphere facing\nEarth, as those astronauts who landed on the Moon could see for themselves, our world\nappears motionless, that is fixed in one spot, pasted on the darkness of the lunar sky. Whether\nEarth appears stationary at the zenith of the lunar sky, half way down the sky, or permanently\nfixed on the horizon, or even half hidden by the horizon, would depend on the lunar locality\nfrom which it is viewed. There is, of course, no need to point out that, from the far side of the\nMoon, Earth is simply not visible.\nAs Alan Stern and Jacqueline Milton pointed out, a similar situation, but somewhat in\nreverse, holds for the planet Pluto and its satellite Charon. Since Charon\u2019s orbital period is\nthe same as Pluto\u2019s rotational period, to a Plutonian, Charon would appear to be similarly\nfixed in the sky.! (Patrick Moore misspoke when he called this \u201ca situation unique in the\nSolar System,\u201d? since he seems to have forgotten the case of the Moon when he penned these\nwords.)\nThere is another way in which Saturn could have appeared immobile in Earth\u2019s sky. This\ncould have come about if Earth had been suspended directly \u201cbeneath\u201d or \u201cabove\u201d one of\nSaturn\u2019s poles, with both planets sharing the same axis of rotation. In that case, Saturn would\nhave appeared fixed in Earth\u2019s north or south celestial sphere. This, however, is not only an\nunheard-of situation which is nowhere duplicated in our present Solar System, it is also one\nwhich defies presently accepted celestial mechanics. All it inspires is disbelief.\nIt is, therefore, understandable that, in his Saturnian scenario, as extracted from the\n\u201cgarbled\u201d system of Philolaos, Lynn Rose opted for an Earth in phase lock with Saturn.3 And\nyet for years I had reason to object to Rose\u2019s explanation of this phenomenon,+ just as he\nfound reason to object to mine\u00ae>\u2014since, almost from the very start of my research, I had\ncome to the conclusion that Saturn\u2019s proper placement in Earth\u2019s primordial sky had to have\nG= that Earth was a satellite of Saturn, one way in which the giant planet could have",

The answer is simple enough: That\nis where the mytho-historical record places the primeval Saturn\u2014plumb in the centre of\nEarth\u2019s north celestial sphere, the very place which is presently occupied by the Pole Star.\n\nThat this is an outlandish theory there is no doubt. Despite the fruit of my research, even I\nended up disbelieving the entire thing, and I must honestly admit that it was not until I had\nread Hamlet\u2019s Mill that I finally accepted all that my research had unearthed. If, as I reasoned\nat the time, scholars of the caliber of Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend, the au-\nthors of Hamlet\u2019s Mill, had been able to unearth the same set of bizarre situations in connec-\ntion with Saturn\u2019s polar station, I could not be that far off the mark myself. If the authors in\nquestion could discuss the ancient belief in a Saturn that was permanently fixed in Earth\u2019s\nnorth celestial sphere, then so could I. That de Santillana and von Dechend chose not to ac-\ncept what they themselves had discovered was their business.\u201d But the lameness with which\nthey ended up explaining away what they had brought to light made me all the more ready to\naccept it all.\n\nNow it has to be said that both Rose\u2019s model and mine (as well as David Talbott\u2019s) are\nbased on the mytho-historical record. Let us then examine what the mytho-historical record\nhas to say about the subject.\n\nEL\u2014ELOAH\u2014ELOHIM\n\nBecause we shall be delving more into the Old Testament as we go along, a few words\nconcerning this collection of Hebrew books are in order.\n\nThe oldest complete version of the Old Testament is the Greek Septuagint (2nd century\nB.C.). The Hebrew text from which it was translated is no longer extant in any complete\nform. The oldest Hebrew version that we now possess in entirety is the Massoretic Text (6th\nto 8th century A. D. ) Not only is there something like eight hundred years separating the\ntwo, there are also major differences between them.\n\nWhile the Septuagint is not always to be preferred, it is superior to the Massoretic Text\nwhich, beyond dispute, contains more numerous corruptions. To be sure, the Massoretic Text\nhas remained unchanged since its \u201cfixing\u201d in the 6th century A.D., but that a great number of\nchanges had been introduced before that date is also well known.\u00ae Textual comparison has\nlong made it obvious that the Septuagint, compiled by the Jewish scholars of Jerusalem at the\nbehest of Demetrius Phalereus and Aristeas for Ptolemy Philadelphus and the Jews of\nAlexandria,? was translated from a Hebrew text that was purer than the much later Mas-\nsoretic version.\n\nThe issue, of course, is more complex than that, but the above should suffice to\nremind the reader that, when it comes to interpretation, not all versions of the Old Testament\nare of equal value. In what follows, and throughout this work, we shall therefore be\ncomparing various versions in an attempt to ferret out what the original beliefs might have\nbeen. In matters where even comparison will leave us stranded at an impasse, however, it is\nto the Septuagint that we shall bow our heads, simply because, where no other arbiter is\navailable, it is the oldest version that should receive the benefit of the doubt.",

    "content": "\nWhat I wish to stress at this point, more than anything else, is that the Old Testament\nspeaks of various deities which, in English and other translations, were changed to read\n\u201cGod,\u201d \u201cLord,\u201d \u201cLord God,\u201d \u201cMost High God,\u201d etc. Leaving all sectarian biases aside, we\nshall therefore re-insert the correct Hebrew names of these deities in the quotes we shall be\nciting throughout the rest of this work. As we progress, we shall also see whether these vari-\nous names were merely cognomens of one and the same deity. The first three such names\nwhich will concern us in this study are El, Eloah, and Elohim.\nNow it has sometimes been stated that \u201cElohim,\u201d which name is mentioned 2570 times in\nthe Old Testament,!\u00b0 is \u201cthe plural of a lost singular.\u201d!! The singular, or synonym, of\n\u201cElohim,\u201d however, is hardly lost; it is merely \u201cEl\u201d and/or \u201cEloah.\u201d!? To William Heidel, the\nElohim were the allies of El!3\u2014whatever these might have been. The name \u201cElohim,\u201d how-\never, was not always used as a plural. A. Murtonen, for instance, tells us: \u201cAs to the primary\nmeaning there cannot be any doubt, the word being formally a plural, but the singular mean-\ning is also very old, as the Ras Shamra [i.e., Ugaritic] texts prove.\u201d!4 Murtonen goes out of\nhis way in attempting to explain this plurality,!> but, in the end, it seems to boil down to an\nold usage equivalent to the more modern royal \u201cwe.\u201d As David Rohl succinctly phrased it:\n\u201cBiblical Hebrew occasionally employs something scholars call the \u2018majestic plural.\u201d\nIn effect it is a plural ending added to a deity\u2019s name to confer status or majesty. In\nthe Old Testament the best example is Elohim which does not mean \u2018the gods\u2019 but is\nrather the god El with the majestic plural im appended.\u201d!6\nEloah, on the other hand, only appears 57 times in the Old Testament, \u201cand almost en-\ntirely in poetry\u201d! such as the Book of Job. That Eloah was the equivalent of El,!8 mean-\nwhile, is brought out in the same Book of Job where the two names are used interchange-\nably.!9 According to Murtonen, this variant of the name is merely the vocative of\n\u201cEl\u201d20\u2014that is the form used in invocation.\nWhich leaves us with the shortened form \u201cEl\u201d which, apart from its inclusion in\ntheophoric names, appears 230 times in the Old Testament.?! That El was the god of Israel\npar excellence is borne out by the fact that when Jacob arrived in the city of Shechem, in the\nland of Canaan, following his twenty-year sojourn working for Laban, he set up an altar and\ncalled it El-elohe-yisrael, which means \u201cEl, God of Israel.\u201d 2?\nMore than that, however, is the very name Israel itself. Although, as Hans Goedicke\nnoted, all efforts to explain the name have been unsuccessful, it is definitely a theophoric one",

The name \u201cIsrael\u201d appears\nfirst in the Book of Genesis where the Patriarch Jacob is described as having wrestled with a\nmysterious stranger, at the end of which the stranger told Jacob: \u201cThy name shall be called\nno more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with Elohim and with men, and\nhast prevailed.\u201d25 The name Israel was, therefore, bestowed on Jacob because he \u201cprevailed\u201d\nlike a prince over the stranger with the power of Elohim. And, as it has been assumed by\nothers before me, the name \u201cIsrael\u201d is composed of the word sarah\u2014\u201cto prevail\u201d \u2014and \u201cEl.\u201d\nThus it might not be amiss to say that \u201cIsrael\u201d most likely means \u201cto prevail like El\u201d or \u201clet\nEl prevail.\u201d\nAs Ronald Hendel argued, El was the oldest god of the Israelites. This is evidenced by\nthe fact that, in the Old Testament, up until the time of the Exodus, theophoric names incor-\nporate only the name of El (as, for example, Israel, Ishmael, and Bethuel).2\u00b0 This coincides\nwith what is known of Canaanite religion in the pre-Israelite period. \u201cThe evidence, from\nUgarit in the north to Sinai in the south, testifies that during [the pre-Israelite period] the high\ngod of various local Canaanite pantheons was named El.\u201d27 Murtonen goes even further\nwhen he states that the name can be traced to primitive times. \u201cThat \u2019el is a very primitive\nword is proved by 1) its existence in all the Semitic languages with the (possible) exception\nof Ethiopic...2) the fact that it was composed of only two radicals...and 3) that these radicals\nare numbered among the most primitive ones.\u201d*8 As for the origin of El, the same authority\ninforms us:\n\u201cEl itself can have been derived only from a concrete conception, i.e., from immedi-\nate experience. In other words, the question is philologically unsolvable.\u201d29\nate experience. In other words, the question is philologically unsolvable.\u201d2\u00b0\nPhilologically unsolvable\u2014perhaps; but not necessarily cosmogonically so, as we shall\nsoon see. We start by asking the question: What could this \u201cconcrete conception,\u201d this\n\u201cimmediate experience,\u201d of which Murtonen speaks, have been? Having already touched\nupon the subject on an earlier page, the identity of El should not surprise the reader. Even so,\nfor starters we mention here the fact that, in Akkadian inscriptions, the phonetic writing for\nEI (or Il) is sometimes used for the logogram otherwise read as An.?\u00b0 In god lists found at\nMari, the two names are interchangeable. As Alfred Eaton disclosed: \u201cIt is known that the\nname El was written with the sign AN (Ik-ru-ub-AN and Ik-ru-ub-Il)...\u201d3! In discussing the\nsame material, Herman Wohlstein argues simply for an identification of El/An as a tutelary\ndeity ,32 an equation that could only have been reached because of the widespread acceptance\nof El, by Jews and Christians alike, as a name simply meaning \u201cGod.\u201d But that \u201cEl\u201d was",

    "content": "\noriginally a proper name has been shown by Murtonen.33 Meanwhile, as we have already\nseen, the god An and/or Anu was a personification of the planet Saturn.\nJulius Morgenstern tells us that, in his role of the all-knowing god, \u201cEl seems to have\nmuch in common with the Babylonian deity, Enki-Ea, the all-wise one.\u201d34 And, on an earlier\npage, we have shown that Enki/Ea is also identifiable as the same planet Saturn.\nNone of this should really surprise anyone. As Frank Moore Cross indicated, El was the\nchief deity of the Mesopotamian Semites, as he was also that of the pre-Islamic Arabs\nbesides the Canaanites.35 In fact it has long been known that the pre-Islamic Allah traces to\nthe same root as El or Eloah.3\u00a2 Cross also cites evidence which equates El with the Egyptian\nPtah (yet another deity we have already seen identified as Saturn) as also with Ba\u2019al (of\nwhom we shall have more to say elsewhere).\nWilliam Albright equated El with the Assyro-Babylonian Shamash?\u2019 which, once again,\nwe have already shown to be an alternate name for the planet Saturn.\nWilliam Heidel goes straight to the heart of the matter when he tells us that \u201cCronos [or\nKronos\u2014the Greek name for the planet Saturn] is called El by the Phoenicians.\u201d3\u00ae This\nidentification traces to the Phoenician scholar Sanchoniathon himself, as quoted by Philo of\nByblos, who identified the Canaanite El with the Greek Kronos? As Cross submitted:\n\u201cPhilo Byblius, and other classical sources, and inscriptions in Greek and Latin all establish\nthe formula that B\u2019! Hmn [i.e., Ba\u2019al Hamon] on the one hand, and El on the other, are Greek\nKronos, Latin Saturnus.\u201d4\u00b0 Moreover, as Cross admits: \u201cThese equations have long been\nknown, and all new data confirm the ancient.\u201d4! Albright, therefore, was on track when he\nidentified El outright with the Latin Saturnus.*?\nWe did not, therefore, misspeak when, on an earlier page, we pointed out that, according\nto the ancients, it was the planet Saturn that was really the god of the Jews. When the Old\nTestament itself, as we have seen, declares El to have been the \u201cGod of Israel,\u201d it is the same\nas saying that Saturn was that god. And, in fact, is this not additionally borne out by the very\nname Israel which, as we have pointed out, incorporates the theophoric name of El who was\nSaturn? Thus, incidentally, when J. Glen Taylor, on Biblical and archaeological evidence,\nwas forced to conclude that it was the \u201csun\u201d that was worshipped in the Jerusalem Temple by\nthe Kings of Judah,3 we can be certain that the \u201csun\u201d in question was the Saturnian one.\nTHE LEFT HAND OF GOD\nIn a Hebrew psalm we read:\n\u201cUnto thee, O Elohim do we give thanks...When I shall receive the congregation I\nwill judge uprightly...Promotion [i.e., exaltation] cometh not from the East, nor from\nthe West, nor from the South.\u201d44",

He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.\u201d 8\nHere, the Hebrew word translated \u201cforward\u201d or \u201cin front\u201d is gedem or gedmah which,\namong other things, means \u201ceastward.\u201d49 As is to be expected, \u2019achor, the Hebrew word\ntranslated as \u201cbackward\u201d or \u201cbehind\u201d also means \u201cwestward.\u201d Semo\u2019l, translated \u201cleft,\u201d\nalso means \u201cnorth.\u201d5! While yamin, that is \u201cright,\u201d also means \u201csouth.\u201d52 Job\u2019s words, above,\nshould therefore read:\n\u201cBehold, I look eastward, but he [i.e., Eloah] is not there; and westward, but I cannot\nperceive him. To the north, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him. He hideth\nhimself in the south, that I cannot see him.\u201d\nThe designations \u201cin front,\u201d \u201cbehind,\u201d \u201cleft hand,\u201d and \u201cright hand,\u201d for \u201ceast,\u201d \u201cwest,\u201d\n\u201cnorth,\u201d and \u201csouth,\u201d came into common use among the Semites much later when the\nSun\u2014that is the present Sun\u2014had replaced the Saturnian one. Because of other factors\nwhich do not here concern us, orientation was indicated by facing east in which the Sun rose.\nThus the east was in front, the west was behind, the north was at one\u2019s left hand, and the\nsouth on one\u2019s right.\nBut here, now, as Warren noted,*3 is the odd thing about the manner in which Job\u2019s\nlament is worded. While lodging his grievance that nowhere\u2014east, west, north, or\nsouth\u2014could he find Eloah, he made a telling distinction concerning the north. The left hand,\nthat is the north, is described as the place \u201cwhere he [that is Eloah] doth work.\u201d So that,\nagain, we find that it was precisely in the north that Eloah, the same as Elohim/El/Saturn,\nwas believed to accomplish his handiwork.\nIt is, therefore, somewhat ironical that the left hand, the place where the god\u2019s goodly\ndeeds were accomplished, became synonymous with bad luck.

When\nElohim was said to have revealed himself to the prophet Ezekiel, as described in the very\nfirst chapters of that book, he is said to have appeared from the north.55\nIt was for this very reason that, when the High Priest of Israel officiated at the altar in\nboth the Tabernacle and, later, in the Jerusalem temple, he was obliged to face north. In\nfact, this priestly ritual of facing north while officiating was practiced by the prelates of other\nancient nations, among them the priests of the Haranite Sabzens.5\u2019 As A. Fornander noted:\n\u201cThe Hawaiian soothsayer, or kilo-kilo, turned always to the North when observing\nthe heavens for signs or omens...The ancient Hindus turned also to the North for di-\nvining purposes, and so did the Iranians before the schism...so did the Greeks, and so\ndid the Scandinavians before their conversion to Christianity.\u201d 58\nThis northernism, meanwhile, must not be understood in a terrestrial sense, but, rather, in\na celestial one. This is brought out by the fact that the circumpolar stars were alluded to as\nKokkabe \u2018El (the \u201cstars of El\u201d).5\u00b0 The throne of El was considered to be \u201cthe pole of the uni-\nverse.\u201d \u00a9 Given all of the above, El (Eloah/Elohim) could only have resided in the north cel-\nestial pole. As Warren observed:\n\u201cThe Pole, the unmoving centre-point of the heavens directly overhead, would natu-\nrally have seemed to be the top of the world, the true heaven, the changeless seat of\nthe supreme, all-ruling God. And if, accordingly, through all the long lifetime of the\nante-diluvian world, the circumpolar sky was to human thought the true abode of\nGod, the oldest post-diluvian peoples, though scattered down the sides of the globe\nhalf or two thirds the distance to the equator, could not easily have forgotten that at\nthe centre and true top of the rotating sky was the throne of its great Creator, and that\nthere, in the far North, was \u2018the sacred quarter\u2019 of the world.\u201d61\nAnd:\n\u201cThe religions of all ancient nations signally confirm and satisfy this antecedent ex-\npectation. With a marvelous unanimity they associate the abode of the supreme God\nwith the North Pole, \u2018the centre of heaven,\u2019 or with the celestial space immediately\nsurrounding it.\u201d62",
