As Talbott reported: \u201cI should mention here that, ac-\ncording to Wal Thornhill, it is possible that in the more electrically active phases the entire\nconfiguration may have moved within a [plasma] discharge sheath\u2014something that would\nnot preclude general illumination by the Sun, but could have kept the illumination diffuse.\u201d*\nIn his own work, that same year, Thornhill described the \u201c[Saturnian] planetary group\u201d as\nhaving been \u201cinside a gigantic cometary coma.\u201d\u201d Three years later, Thornhill restated his\nconviction when he wrote that, in his opinion, Earth orbited in the anode dark space beneath\nthe chromosphere of the brown dwarf that was proto-Saturn.\u201d\n\u201cEarth situated inside the spherical envelope of such a star radiating according to the\nusual inverse square law, would find the energy influx almost equal over the entire\nplanet. Such an arrangement is far more benign toward life than at present where the\nenergy source, the Sun, subtends a small angle in the sky.\u201d\nBrown dwarf stars, to which we had compared both Saturn and Jupiter in an earlier\nchapter, had by then been discovered in quantity. In our neighborhood alone, it has been\nstated, there may be more brown dwarfs than Sun-like stars.\u201d Some of these have been cal-\nculated to be one-tenth the size of the Sun with a temperature rising no more than 950\u00b0 K.\nIn answer to the question whether living entities, including man, would have been able to\nbreathe the constituents of Saturn\u2019s brown dwarf atmosphere, Thornhill replied with the\nwords:\n\u201cWe are [presently] nestled in the Sun\u2019s atmosphere without it causing us any prob-\nlems. Proto-Saturn\u2019s envelope would have been more dense but still a good approxi-\nmate to a vacuum. The constituents of the atmosphere of brown dwarf stars, so far as\nthey have been determined, seem to include water molecules and others helpful to\nlife.\u201d\u00ae\nWhat did Thornhill mean by stating that we are presently nestled within the Sun\u2019s atmos-\nphere. As Gary Zank plainly puts it: \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded by hot gas.\u201d And whence this gas?\nZank explains:\n\u201cAs our sun moves through extremely \u2018empty\u2019 or low-density interstellar space, the\nsolar wind produces a protective bubble\u2014the heliosphere around our solar system,\nwhich allows life to flourish on Earth...Without the heliosphere, neutral hydrogen\nwould interact with our atmosphere, possibly producing catastrophic climate changes,",

Cometary tails are also now known to be composed of plasma. But, more\nthan that, the Solar System itself is encased in a magnetic bubble, known as the heliosphere,\nthat contracts and expands \u201clike a colossal jellyfish.\u201d Although the existence of the helio-\nsphere had already been known, Pioneer 10 revealed that the bubble is much larger than it\nhad been predicted. Its edge is now believed to lie somewhere between 5 and 10 billion miles\nfrom the Sun. It is this heliosphere\u2014this \u201cbreathing bubble\u201d as it is now being called\u2014that\nacts as a \u201ccocoon\u201d which \u201callows life to flourish on earth.\u201d\nWhat all this amounts to is that Earth resides within the Sun\u2019s heliosphere, just as Ashton\nand Thornhill suppose it once resided in proto-Saturn\u2019s plasma sheath, a hypothesis that can\nno longer be dismissed as far-fetched.\nAs Thornhill explained further:\n\u201cThe astronomer [William] Herschel believed that people inhabited the Sun beneath\nits shining clouds. We now know that is a crazy idea. But would it be so crazy if the\nSun were a brown dwarf star? To a close observer, proto-Saturn would have looked\nlike a dim red star. Red giants have immense, very low density envelopes. If Betel-\ngeuse were to replace the Sun, it would encompass all of the planets out as far as Ju-\npiter! Astronomers accept the idea that planets could orbit within the thin envelope of\nsuch stars.\u201d\n\u201cAnother interesting consequence is that all objects orbiting in that region would re-\nceive the same energy per unit area of their surface. The spectrum of the light would\nhave been much redder than at present...\u201d\nTrue, as already noted, Earth\u2019s primordial star would have been feebler than our present\nSun, but this would have been compensated for by Earth\u2019s proximity to proto-Saturn which\nwould have involved a stretch that was much shorter than its present distance from the Sun,\nto say nothing of the redder spectrum of light in which it would have been bathed.\nBut could Saturn\u2019s plasmasphere have existed within the Sun\u2019s heliosphere which is itself\nnothing but a plasmasphere? Can a plasmasphere exist within another? As already noted, our\nworld itself is now being spoken of as being in a \u201cnear-Earth plasma environment.\u201d\u201d What\ndoes this mean?",

    "content": "\nIt was in 1962, due to Mariner 2, that the interplanetary medium was found not to be a\nnear-vacuum as previously believed. Instead, this medium was found to consist of plasma.\nBut, even then, the full implication of this discovery was not immediately understood. As\nRalph Juergens, writing in 1972, noted:\n\u201cOne of the primary characteristics of a plasma has up to now received little or no at-\ntention from astronomers. This is its ability to shield itself from the electric field of\nany body in contact with it, or contained within it, and charged to an electric potential\ndifferent from that of the plasma itself. The mechanism by which such shielding is\naccomplished was named the space-charge sheath by those who first studied the phe-\nnomenon.\u201d\u201d\nAnd:\n\u201cBy the same sort of analysis, I would conclude that the earth has a potential not quite\nin keeping with its space environment, and that it therefore is surrounded by a space\ncharge sheath. For the same reasons that a comet\u2019s sheath is elongated away from the\nsun, I would suppose that the earth\u2019s sheath has a tail; in other words, I would equate\nthe terrestrial sheath with the earth\u2019s so-called magnetosphere.\u201d\nSo, also, Wallace Thornhill who, during one of the question periods at the Society for\nInterdisciplinary Studies\u2019 Silver Jubilee in September 1999, made reference to \u201cEarth\u2019s\nwindsock-like envelope\u201d usually referred to as its \u201cmagnetotail.\u201d As he there pointed out: \u201cIn\nJuergens\u2019 view it is a plasma sheath...\u201d\nBy the turn of the century, astrophysicists themselves were speaking of plasmaspheres\naround the bodies of the Solar System as if they had always known about them. Venus, it was\ndiscovered, possessed a plasmasphere in the form of a cometary tail that spread close enough\nto \u201ctickle the Earth when the two planets are in line with the Sun.\u201d\u201d Jupiter, too, is now\nknown to be surrounded by a plasma sheet which, like the Sun\u2019s electrical current sheet, lies\nalong Jupiter\u2019s magnetic equator.\u201d So, similarly, with Saturn. As Thornhill noted, had Sat-\nurn\u2019s plasma sheath been visible in the sky, it would make the planet appear as a distinct disc\ninstead of the mere pin-point of light we see in the night sky.\u201d Eventually, Earth\u2019s own\nplasmasphere, which has been calculated to extend at least 12,000 miles into space, was even\n\u201cphotographed.\u201d",

On the contrary, the theory\nnot only fits current astrophysical reality, it is actually demanded by it.\n\nAll of the plasmaspheres within the Solar System, however, are transparent and, as such,\nare not able to reflect radiation back toward the primary around which they are wrapped. As\nalready noted, Ashton had theorized that the plasmasphere surrounding our posited Saturnian\nsystem would have had to have been opaque. But can a plasmasphere be opaque? The answer\nis that it can. As Anthony Peratt, one of the foremost plasma physicists alive today, has\nstated, a \u201cplasma cloud...indeed can vary between transparent and opaque at different wave-\nlengths.\u201d So in that, also, we seem to be on the right track.\n\nSIXTH INTERLUDE\n\nIn the meantime, before moving to the next phase of our reconstruction, which will help\nus to unearth more of the evidence we are looking for, it behooves us to recapitulate what we\nhave learned in these last three chapters. It also allows us to expand our list of theses which,\nin keeping with the chronological sequence of events, will now have to be reshuffled and re-\nnumbered.\n\nHypothesis #1: That, from what can be deduced from ancient as well as primitive astro-\nnomical lore, Earth had once been a satellite of the planet Saturn, originally a brown dwarf\nstar, which, because of its proximity, loomed large in the sky as a distinct disc larger than the\napparent size of the full Moon.\n\nHypothesis #2: That, still according to ancient astronomical lore, during this indetermi-\nnate period, Saturn was the only visible celestial body in Earth\u2019s primordial sky.\n\nHypothesis #3: That, as seen from Earth, the Saturnian sun did not rise and/or set, but\nremained visibly immobile at all times.\n\nHypothesis #4: That Saturn\u2019s immobility was due to the fact that Earth was stationed di-\nrectly \u201cbeneath\u201d Saturn\u2019s south pole and that, from Earth, Saturn therefore appeared to be\npermanently fixed in the north celestial sphere, the very place now occupied by the Pole Star.\nWhat this also means is that Saturn and Earth were linearly aligned with the both of them\nsharing the same axis of rotation.",

This was an age which,\ndespite its remoteness in time, ended up etching itself indelibly in human consciousness. It\nwas a time during which the Sun, the Moon, and the stars were not yet visible in the sky. Sat-\nurn ruled alone.\n\nHypothesis #7: This age, we have also found out, could not have been one of total dark-\nness, and that, in fact, mankind itself remembers that the Saturnian deity actually shed a\nfeeble light. The terrestrial environment during this age was bathed in a perpetual twilight or,\nrather, a protracted dawn, which man remembered as the dawn of Creation.\n\nHypothesis #8: That, during this period, a nebulous entity, which our ancestors had diffi-\nculty in describing clearly, surrounded the Saturnian primary. We have conjectured this en-\ntity to have been a placental cloud, or circumstellar disk, surrounding the Saturnian orb. This\nentity seems to have been that to which the ancients alluded to as Chaos.\n\nHypothesis #9: During this same unspecified period, the Saturnian orb was seen to float\nover an apparition which, to ancient man, looked like water, a cosmic ocean. This \u201cwater\u201d\nwas probably the same nebular disk which, spinning slowly, would have had the appearance\nof a celestial whirlpool.\n\nHypothesis #10: That, at some later time, Saturn shone much brighter than it had previ-\nously done, bright enough for ancient man to allude to it consistently as a sun.\n\nHypothesis #11: That this primordial Saturnian sun shone during that time we today call\nthe night.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that ancient man could only describe what he had witnessed\nin the sky. Our ancient forefathers could not, however, tell what the cause of any of it was. It\nis even doubtful that they thought about it or even cared. To them, whatever it was they saw\nwas simply there. Unlike our present Sun, proto-Saturn did not rise or set. It did not move. It\njust sat there, doing nothing. It offered them no harm. It had always been there. They had al-\nways remembered it. They would have taken it for granted.\n\nThere is, however, one discordant note concerning all this. As it is now becoming in-\ncreasingly clear, there is \u201ca dearth of brown dwarfs in close orbits around Sun-like stars\u201d\u201d\n\u2014which means that the chances of our Sun having had a brown dwarf in orbit around it is\npretty slim. It therefore seems we are not yet out of the woods.",

With a dim Saturnian orb embedded within an indistinct nebulosity perpetually\nsuspended overhead, and with the Sun, the Moon, and the stars still apparently absent from\nthe sky\u2014in other words, without the succession of day and night\u2014there would have been\nnothing on which ancient man could have focused that would have enabled him to calculate\nthe passage of time. This, then, presents us with yet another opportunity to test the internal\nconsistency of the mytho-historical record because, if the above surmise is correct, our theory\ndemands that the record should have something to say about the subject. If man could not tell\ntime, he would have known nothing about it. The idea of a day, a month, or a year would\nhave meant nothing to him. The concept of time would not even have occurred to him.

This association is as old as the first\nGreek speculations on the nature of time in the preceding early period of Greek cul-\nture.\u201d*\nture.\u201d\u00ae\nSo, similarly, with the Italic god Saturnus, as Cicero informs us:\n\u201cSaturnus was chosen as the one to have as his province the intervals and cycles of\ntime. In Greek this god is called by the very word time, since Kronos is the same as\nchronos, that is, time. We call him Saturnus because he saturates himself with years.\u201d\u201d\nStecchini goes on with:\n\u201cThe etymological connection of the two words Kronos and chronos has been\npositively affirmed by some linguists and strongly denied by others, because, on the\none hand, the semantic similarity of the two words is evident and, on the other, from a\ntechnical linguistic point of view, the difference between K and ch is most\nsignificant.\u201d'\u00b0\nAION\nAs for Janus himself, Lydus informs us that he was by some considered the father of\nAion and, by others, Aion\u2019s very self.'' But Aion, who was the god of time which gave us the\nEnglish word \u201ceon,\u201d was that \u201cunlimited order\u201d held as an \u201cindestructible bond\u201d by Kronos,\nwho was Saturn.\u2019 More than that, Aion has been directly identified as Saturn.\u2019 As the god of\ntime, Janus was made to preside over the first day of the month, and the first month of the\nyear, which month, in fact, was named after him\u2014Januarius, i.e., January.\" In time, and for\nreasons we shall soon see, he even became the god of the seasons.'*\nThe association of Saturn with time, meanwhile, does not rest on the fallacious etymo-\nlogical equation of Kronos with Chronos, as Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend\neventually pointed out when they stated that:\n\u201cIt is not hidden from us that the indestructible laws of philology do not allow for the\nidentification of Kronos and Chronos, although in Greece to do so \u2018was customary at",
