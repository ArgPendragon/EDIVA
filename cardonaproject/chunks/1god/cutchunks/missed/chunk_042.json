And then, would such\n\u201cfigures of speech\u201d have been incorporated throughout the entire world? Would all the an-\ncient races have chosen the same \u201cfigures of speech\u201d? Would they all have decided to place\nSaturn in a locality it never occupied? And would they all have chosen the north celestial\npole as that locality? What purpose would it have served?\nDespite the fact that, in Ais Saturnian scenario, Lynn Rose opted for an Earth phase-\nlocked with Saturn to account for the latter\u2019s apparent immobility, even he had to admit that,\nas far as the ancients were concerned, Saturn\u2019s stated celestial station was at the north celes-\ntial pole. So how, then, did he get around the mytho-historical record\u2019s obvious message?\nTaking a different, and more plausible, tack than de Santillana and von Dechend, he offered\nthe following:\n\u201cThe traditions about an immovable Saturn atop some special pole made little sense\nafter the Age of Kronos had come to an end. Those traditions were later revised and\nwere attributed to the only \u2018immovable\u2019 point...that could be found in the newer sky.\nTo people in the northern hemisphere...this was the north celestial pole...\u201d\"\u201d\nAnd:\n\u201cAs long as Saturn was atop its pole, the Age of Kronos endured. The immobility of\nthat body was a sign of the stability of the cosmic order. Later...the stability of the\nnorth star was seen as an indication that the world or the world age was not yet com-\ning to an end. The Age of Kronos had ended when the only immobile body in the sky\nhad left its position atop the axis of the world; that was the main reason that the later\nancients looked to the north star: it was now the body that lay atop the axis of the\nworld, and, as long as it remained there, the world was stable. Thus there was a trans-\nfer from Saturn to the north star, with much attendant garbling. Traditions that em-\nphasize the north, and especially those traditions that associate Saturn with the north,\nneed to be interpreted very carefully. After Saturn left us, or we left Saturn, there was\nonly one fixed point in the sky: the celestial pole of rotation...Much that has been\nsaid about Saturn would, in the absence of Saturn, have been transferred to the only\nthing in the new sky that displayed the sort of stability that Saturn had once dis-\nplayed.\u201d\"*\nThus, Rose believes that Saturn\u2019s polar placement was the result of later revisions by\nthose who could not otherwise make sense of the original accounts pertaining to Saturn\u2019s\nimmobility. But, as I had stated once before,\u201d this rationalization is not supported by the\nmytho-historical record. Rose does not even hazard a guess as to when this revision might\nhave taken place or by whom. All he leaves us with is the statement that it happened \u201cafter\nthe Age of Kronos had come to an end.\u201d\nNow, while possible, is it probable that \u201cthese traditions\u201d would have later been\n\u201crevised\u201d just about all over the world? And would they all have been revised in the same\nmanner? Besides, had such revisions occurred, the revisionists would have been bound to\noverlook some data that would contradict the modified scheme. Yet nowhere in the mytho-\nhistorical record can one find such overlooked clues. Could the ancients have been that",

    "content": "\ndiligent in expurgating their received traditions? Is it believable that such expurgation would\nhave taken place all over the world with such completeness?\nRose correctly informs us that, during the Saturnian age, the planet\u2019s immobility was tan-\ntamount to cosmic stability. When Saturn\u2019s immobile placement was catastrophically dis-\nplaced, the stability of the cosmic order was impaired. Following this event, the only\nimmobile object in the sky was the North or Pole Star. The immobility of this star became a\nsign of the stability of the new celestial order. It was because of this, according to Rose, that\nSaturn\u2019s former phase-locked immobility was transferred to the North Star\u2019s polar station.\nYet, as we have seen through the parable of Vishnu and Dhruva, the record dictates exactly\nthe opposite \u2014that the polar station had been Saturn\u2019s before it became the Pole Star\u2019s.\nAfter all, what is the point in attempting to reconstruct a cosmic history based on the\nmytho-historical record if one ends up tampering with that record in order to make the data\nfit a different model than the one dictated by the record? As Frederic Jueneman once admon-\nished, \u201cthe tapestry of myth is intricately woven, and each thread must be followed to wher-\never it leads, however improbable the initial appearance.\u201d Despite the fact that Jueneman\nhimself ended up by ignoring his own dictum,\" the point should be well taken. In Rose\u2019s\ncase, his Saturnian model was supposedly constructed on a system said to have been laid out\nby Philolaos. But, as I had indicated in an earlier work,\u201d Rose\u2019s model bears but little re-\nsemblance to that system. When he, therefore, calls his scheme \u201cVariations on a Theme of\nPhilolaos,\u201d the emphasis has to be on \u201cVariations.\u201d Rose himself indicated his awareness of\nthis when he wrote:\n\u201cWe have supposedly been composing variations on a theme of Philolaos, but if there\nis truth in these variations, it will emerge that Philolaos or someone else was compos-\ning variations on another theme, and that what we know as the system of Philolaos is\na garbled and misapplied version of or variations on what was once fact.\u201d '\u00ae\nAll of which explains the changes, assumptions, deductions, arguments, stipulations, sug-\ngestions, ifs, and buts, that Rose was forced to lead his readers through in his effort to make\nsense of this \u201cgarbled\u201d system and force-fit it into one of his own making. As I have pointed\nout once before,\u2019* Rose will be the first to argue that this juggling was necessary to rid the\nsystem of its unrealistic aspects and supplanting them with something more defensible.\nThrough similar procedures, however, the Philolaos system could be turned into any scheme\nof one\u2019s own liking.\nIn our own scheme, as presented in this work, we make no changes to the mytho-histori-\ncal record. We do not assume anything that is not there spelled out. Our deductions are based\non what we find recorded. In other words, heeding Jueneman\u2019s admonition, we have taken,\nas we will continue to take, the mytho-historical record at face value, no matter how\nimprobable its initial appearance may be. There really would be no point in doing otherwise.\nIt may now be objected that had Saturn really occupied a position in Earth\u2019s north celes-\ntial sphere, those people inhabiting Earth\u2019s southern hemisphere would not have been able to\nsee it. It therefore becomes obvious that any beliefs concerning these early cosmic events that",

Ancient\nastronomical beliefs are therefore here being considered together with mythology as a unified\nwhole regardless of the fact that what is thus coming to light tends to describe a Solar System\nthat was entirely alien to the one we now inhabit.\nLater in this work we will attempt a validation of the physical feasibility of the model we\nhave so far delineated, even though not all of the players in this unfolding cosmic scheme are\nyet in place. What I will add here is a reminder to the effect that many were the things once\nthought impossible which were eventually found to be possible, and that many of these ended\nup becoming dogmas of science. Easily coming to mind in this respect are the occurrence of\nmeteoric falls, the non-illusory nature of comets, and continental drift. But let us put all that\naside for the time being. Allow me instead to concentrate on the demands which our model\nitself raises, and whether or not these demands can be met.\nWhat do I mean by \u201cdemands\u201d?\nTheories do not stand, if they are to stand at all, in isolation. They raise certain demands.\nFor instance, the theory concerning the nuclear fueling of the Sun demands that the Sun shed\na vast amount of subatomic particles known as neutrinos. But, despite large sums of money\nspent in constructing complex instruments to register them,' not enough neutrinos, if any,\nhave so far been detected. Raymond Davis, who has been \u201ctrapping\u201d neutrinos for decades,\n\u201chas consistently detected about one-third fewer neutrinos than predicted by theories of the\nsolar interior\u201d?\u2014which means only two-thirds the amount predicted. Most other experiment-\ners, however, can only vouch for about one-third the predicted amount?
