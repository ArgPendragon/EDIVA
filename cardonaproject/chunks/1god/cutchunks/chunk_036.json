It seems, however, that there is more to this \u201cresting\u201d business than meets the\neye. Or why would the planet in question have been named for that particular day, thus also\nreceiving the meaning of \u201crest\u201d?\nThe connection of Saturn with the Creation is not restricted to Hebrew tradition. In\nChapter 4, we also had occasion to mention a similar tradition as believed in by the Persians.\nE Chapter 4 we claimed that the Hebrew name for the planet Saturn, that is Shabtai,! was\nWe repeat that tradition here as recorded by Al-Biruni:\n\u201cOn the 6th day of Farwardin, the day Khurdadh, is the great Nauroz, for the Persians\na feast of great importance. On this day\u2014they say\u2014God finished the creation, for it\nis the last of the six days...On this day God created Saturn...\u201d4\nWhat did the planet Saturn have to do with Creation or the resting of Elohim? Why was\nSaturn known as the Lord of the Sabbath?5\nOne of the strange things about the Sabbath is that it is the only day to which the Israel-\nites gave a name. The rest of the days of the week were called by their ordinal numbers.\u00a2\nWhy this exception? Why was Saturn of importance even to the ancient Hebrews? Not that,\nin later times, they were overly proud of this. In fact, as William Heidel informs us, they re-\nsented the identification of the Sabbath with Saturn\u2019s day for long afterwards.\u201d\nThat Shabtai, sometimes referred to as Kokab Sabet, also called the Sabbath Star,?\nmeant \u201cthe resting Star or Planet\u201d is well known.!\u00b0 In his attempt to connect the order of\nCreation, day by day, as described in the Book of Genesis, with the different planetary deities\nhonored traditionally on the successive days of the seven-day week, Robert Graves, as usual,",

    "content": "\nmuddled the entire issue.!! The only points of validity that he mentioned is the well known\nassociation of the Jewish Sabbath with Saturn and the fact that this planetary deity had long\nbeen known as the god of repose, that is of rest.!2 But, if we discount the derivation of the\nname Shabtai from the business of Elohim\u2019s rest after Creation, what can we offer by way of\nan explanation for this unusual characteristic? Or, why was the planet Saturn called the\nResting Star or Planet?\nTHE GOD OF THE JEWS\nThe Israelite connection with the planet Saturn goes beyond the naming of the Sabbath\nafter this planetary deity. Thus, for instance, when the prophet Amos was riling against the\nIsraelites, he accused them of having carried images of a stellar deity in a tabernacle. The\nKing James version of the passage in question is made to read:\n\u201cHave ye offered...sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of\nIsrael? But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the\nstar of your god, which ye made to yourselves.\u201d 3\nThis memory was still vivid in the days of the New Testament and is repeated in the Acts\nof the Apostles where the figure of Chiun is replaced with that of Remphan:\n\u201c...O ye house of Israel, have ye offered...slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of\nforty years in the wilderness? Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star\nof your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them...\u201d !4\nThis is in keeping with the Septuagint version of the same passage which reads:\n\u201cHave ye offered...victims and sacrifices, O house of Israel, forty years in the wilder-\nness? Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Rephan, the\nimages of them which ye made for yourselves.\u201d\nThe forty years in the wilderness alluded to in the above verses refer to the wandering of\nthe Israelites following their departure, or exodus, from Egypt under Moses. Concerning the\ndeity called Moloch we will offer nothing here, reserving the topic for a future work. Here I\nwish to concentrate on the god called Chiun in one version and Remphan/Rephan in the oth-\ners. Who was this deity? In both Amos and Acts this god is alluded to as \u201cthe star of your\ngod\u201d \u2014that is the star of the Israelites\u2019 god. But what star did Remphan personify?\nIn the Testament of Solomon, Remphan is rendered Raphan concerning whom Solomon\nwas said to have built a temple in conjunction with one to Baal/Moloch.!5 The Testament of\nSolomon is of Jewish origin but, as Louis Ginzberg informs us, as we now have it, it is laden\n\u201cwith many Christian layers.\u201d!\u00a9 This is noted here because the name Raphan (or Ramphan or\nRephan) is unknown in Hebrew and must therefore have been introduced, or transliterated,\nby one of the Christian editors. Ginzberg was of the opinion that Raphan (or Rephaim) is a",

In more recent years, for instance, Carl Jung\nknew very well that Saturn was the star of Israel.22 Much earlier, Aurelius Augustinus was\nmore explicit when he informed his readers that the ancients considered the planet Saturn as\nthe god of the Jews. Throughout the Middle Ages, the Jews were largely known as the\nPeople of Saturn\u201d (as so, incidentally, were the Scythians?5). This belief, however, is much\nolder than that since even the Roman historian Tacitus (c. A.D. 55-117) described the Jews as\nworshipping the planet Saturn as their god.26\n\nWhether the tabernacle in question was the acclaimed one that Moses was said to have\nhad constructed, and in which the famed ark of the covenant was housed, remains a moot\nquestion. This much, however, should be stated: While the tabernacle which Moses had had\nbuilt is usually referred to as the Mishkan and/or the Ohel, the tabernacle mentioned in the\nHebrew version of Amos is simply called sukot, the plural of suka, meaning \u201ctents.\u201d\n\nTHE TROUBLE WITH AMOS\n\nScholars of the Jewish faith have, naturally enough, found much to criticize in the above\ninterpretation of the Amosian verse in question.\u2019 As it has been said, this \u201cis a difficult verse\nand the subject of very diverse interpretation\u201d ?\u00ae \u2014or, as M. Weinfeld put it, a verse on which\nmany a pen has been broken,\u201d (although, in my opinion, his has fared no better). This diffi-\nculty is not abated by the fact that the Hebrew \u2014that is Masoretic\u2014version of the passage in\nquestion replaces Moloch with Siccuth (or Sikut, Sikkut) while placing the event as coming\nin the future rather than having occurred in the past. Thus: \u201cSo shall you take up Siccuth your\nking and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.\u201d",

    "content": "One of the things that has happened here is quite obvious. The reading \u201cthe suka of your\nMoloch\u201d is rendered as \u201cSiccuth your melek\u201d \u2014that is, \u201cSiccuth your king.\u201d This, in turn, was\nbased on the assumption that Siccuth is the same name of the Assyrian god Sakkuth.3\u00b0\n\nThe Masoretic version is thus interpreted this way: In his accusation of Israel, Amos con-\ndemns the people to carry these idols, Sikut and Chiun, with them into the coming Babylon-\nian exile as punishment for having worshipped them in his day.\n\nWe will not here enter into a discussion concerning which version is to be preferred.3! To\nus, whether Chiun was worshipped by the Israelites during the time of Moses or the days of\nAmos does not change the fact that the Israelites did worship this god. Nor does it change the\nfact that this deity was no other than the Saturn of other nations.\n\nThere will now be those who will want to tell me that it is no secret that the Israelites of-\nten fell prone to worshipping false idols and that the case in question reflects no more than\nthat. And, in truth, this is the way in which the verse has been understood by adherents of\nboth the Gentile and Hebrew versions. The association of Shabtai/Saturn with the Hebrew\nSabbath, however, as well as the additional data we will be presenting in the following pages,\nincluding, incidentally, the very name of Israel, speaks against this.\n\nMoreover, hidden within the expression of the Masoretic version of Amos is a datum that\nwill actually strengthen our case. Here I can safely state that even were sikut (that is\n\u201ctents/tabernacles\u201d) made to read Siccuth (in reference to the Assyrian Sakkuth), it would in\nno way invalidate our thesis. Not only would the Saturnian connection of this verse remain\nthrough the undisputed inclusion of Chiun/Kewan, but, ironically, the Assyrian god Sakkuth\nis himself associated in Akkadian texts with the planet Saturn.32\n\nNow it so happens that, just as Shabtai/Saturn translates as \u201cthe resting Planet,\u201d so is\nChiun/Saturn related to a similar characteristic. The word chun, from which the name is de-\nrived,?3 carries the meanings of \u201cestablish,\u201d \u201cfix and/or fixed,\u201d \u201cfirm,\u201d and \u201cstable.\u201d34 Very\nmuch like Shabtai, Chiun can therefore be translated as \u201cthe fixed, firm, or stable planet Sat-\nurn.\u201d In other words, the reference is to a planet at rest. What could this mean?\n\nTHE STABLE ONE\n\nThe old west Semitic deity named Hammu has long been considered to be a sun god.35\nThis is the deity for whom the famous Hammurabi, the first king of the Amorite Dynasty of\nBabylon, was named (or named himself).36 Hammu\u2019s identity as the Sun has been seen to be\nstrengthened by the name of Hammurabi\u2019s fourth successor, Ammizaduga, which name\ntranslates as \u201cAmmi |that is Hammu] is Justice.\u201d This, as Julius Lewy pointed out, accords\nwell with the Assyro-Babylonian Shamash who, in Akkadian hymns, is invoked as kittum,\nthat is \u201cjustice.\u201d37 As we have seen, however, Shamash had originally been a name reserved\nfor the planet Saturn. Should we not then see in Hammu a name for the same planet? Thus,\nfor instance, Hammurabi, named after Saturn, would not have been guilty of apostasy when",

Likewise, when Hammurabi had the\nlaws for which he became famous inscribed on a stela, he had himself depicted as receiving\nthem from Shamash. One cannot, therefore, rightly blame mythologists for identifying\nHammu as a sun-god since, in effect, he was the personification of just that\u2014a sun; the pri-\nmeval Saturnian sun to be sure, but a sun nonetheless.\nThe association with justice, however, is not the only datum on which we can base the\nidentification of Hammu as a personification of the planet Saturn? As Lewy noted, Hammu\nis equivalent to \u201cAman which was a name for the planet Saturn.\u201d How is this identity\nderived? \u2019AmAn, as well as other related names, belong to a linguistic root which means\n\u201cstable\u201d and/or \u201cthe stable one.\u201d And, as Lewy pointed out, \u201cthe stable one\u201d is the meaning\nof the Akkadian name of Saturn, that is Kaimanu, the same as the Arabic Kaiw4n and the\nSyriac K\u00e9w4n,*! the Chiun of the Book of Amos.\nMorris Jastrow tells us that the reason Saturn was called \u201cstable\u201d and/or \u201cregular\u201d and/or\n\u201csteady\u201d was \u201cbecause of the slow and regular motion which is [the planet\u2019s] distinguishing\nfeature.\u201d 42 To be sure, this is the usual explanation that is still given to account for the close-\nto-universal ancient belief we are here considering. But while \u201cstable,\u201d \u201cregular,\u201d and\n\u201csteady,\u201d may account for the slowness of the planet as seen with the naked eye from Earth,\nits slowness cannot be made to account for its additional characteristics of being \u201cfixed\u201d or\n\u201cfirm,\u201d to say nothing of it being described as being \u201cat rest.\u201d Slow the planet may seem to\nmove, but it moves. What the ancients seem to be telling us here is that, in a time long gone\nby, the planet Saturn did not appear to move. Can this be validated?\nTHE GOD OF JERUSALEM\nThe claim that the famed Ebla tablets have shown that Salem and Jerusalem were two dif-\nferent places\u00ae has not been validated. We must therefore continue to accept the statement of\nFlavius Josephus who claimed that Salem had been an earlier name for Jerusalem.\u201c4 Salem,\nFlavius Josephus who claimed that Salem had been an earlier name for Jerusalem.\u201c Salem,\nor shalem, once thought to signify \u201cpeace,\u201d is now known to have been the name of an early\nCanaanite deity.45 Up until recently, this deity had been identified as Venus\u201c but, as we shall\nsee, this identity does not hold.\nIn Chaldean, Jerusalem was rendered Yerushalem; in Hebrew, it changed to Yerushalaim.\nBoth names mean \u201cfounded by Shalem.\u201d Moreover, in a letter sent to an Egyptian king of the\nEighteenth Dynasty, Jerusalem is mentioned both by that name and as Bit Sulmani.47 As\nJulius Lewy concluded, this letter \u201cleaves no doubt that the city was then known not only as",
