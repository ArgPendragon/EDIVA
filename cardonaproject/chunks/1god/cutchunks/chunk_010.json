    "content": "\ncertainly known to have a past that is rooted in primitive polytheistic religion and cel-\nestial mythology ... The question we address is why.\u201d\u201d\u201d\nMost mythologists who have favored an astronomical interpretation of mythology have\nhowever been handicapped by the uniformitarian dogma that the Solar System has remained\nunchanged for millions of years. Not only that, some of them have even utilized this dogma\nas the very basis for astro-mythological beliefs. Thus, for instance, Elmer Suhr who could\nfeel confident in reporting that:\n\u201cAstronomy, including manifestations of sun, moon, stars, comets and meteors, has\nthe advantage of remaining constant in its movements and consistently the same in\nappearance over great periods of time; its forms are more geometric, its changes more\nregular, all of which gave the heavens more prestige in the mind of primitive man.\u201d\u201d*\nThis, I intend to show, has been the great pitfall of most mythologists who could not rec-\noncile the heaven alluded to by our ancient forefathers with the one that now stretches above\nand around us. And yet, as I hope to demonstrate, it was the very opposite to what Suhr be-\nlieved that lay at the very foundation of mytho-astronomical belief. In fact, what I wish to\nstress is that the astronomical bodies of the Solar System were deified by ancient man the\nworld over not because they consistently followed an ordained pattern, but precisely because\nthey did not.\nAs Lewis Farnell noted early in the twentieth century: \u201cWhat is normal in nature and so-\nciety rarely excites the myth-making imagination, which is more likely to be kindled by the\nabnormal, some startling catastrophe, some terrible violation of the social code.\u201d\nAnd as the French anthropologist Emile Durkheim (1858-1917) pointed out:\n\u201c.,.that which characterizes the life of nature is a regularity which approaches\nmonotony. Every morning the sun mounts the horizon, every evening it sets; every\nmonth the moon goes through the same cycle; the river flows in an uninterrupted\nmanner in its bed; the same seasons periodically bring back the same sensations. To\nbe sure, here and there an unexpected event sometimes happens: the sun is eclipsed,\nthe moon is hidden behind clouds, the river overflows. But these momentary varia-\ntions could only give birth to equally momentary impressions, the remembrance of\nwhich is gone after a little while; they could not serve as a basis for these stable and\npermanent systems of ideas and practices which constitute religions. Normally, the\ncourse of nature is uniform, and uniformity could never produce strong emotions.\u201d*\u00b0\nWhile not exactly an authority on mythological subjects, it is also worth noting the words\nof Frederick Hall who wrote:\n\u201cIf we will the myths their proper credence in the light of new evidence of planetary\ncatastrophism, we will find that they can add much to our store of knowledge. All\nmythical accounts may not be equally authentic\u2014and surely many are garbled\u2014but",

    "content": "\nthis simply emphasizes the care that must be taken in research if we are to reach a be-\nlievable consensus between the message of myth and the discoveries of space age sci-\nence.\u201d\nThis is a bold statement to come from an engineer who had worked at the Stanford Linear\nAccelerator Laboratory, but, as we shall see, the content of myth can help us garner new as-\ntronomical knowledge even if, at first sight, this knowledge may appear to be at variance\nwith what we believe we know. In fact, even that so-called pillar of astrophysics, the Big\nBang Theory, had been much earlier posited in a religious work.\nIn the Book of Genesis, Elohim, usually translated into English as \u201cGod,\u201d begins the cre-\nation with the words: \u201cLet there be light.\u201d And, it is there written, \u201cthere was light.\u201d There\nhave been many who have seen a similarity between this description of beginnings and the\nBig Bang Theory. The following, one of several such, comes from a popular work devoted to\nthe mysteries of the Bible:\n\u201cPrevailing scientific theory proposes that the universe was created in a flash of light.\nThis \u2018big bang,\u2019 or cosmic explosion, is believed to have occurred some 16 billion\nyears ago. Some see parallels between this modern, scientific theory and the biblical\naccount which opens with God\u2019s command, \u2018Let there be light\u2019.\u201d\u201d\u201d\nGranted, on its own, this similarity is not enough for one to claim that the theory in ques-\ntion had already been posited in a religious work. The Book of Genesis is not, however, the\nreligious work I have in mind. So bear with me for a while.\nGeorge Gamow is the acclaimed father of the Big Bang theory. But before Gamow there\nwas Georges Lemaitre who, in 1927, was the first to propose that a hot, dense, primeval\n\u201catom\u201d had exploded, flinging its contents outward to create the universe.\u201d With the advent\nOf the theory in question, Pope Pius XII himself had it stated that \u201cscientists are beginning to\nfind the finger of God in the creation of the universe.\u201d\"* Lemaitre, who was a Catholic priest\nbesides being a physicist, was later decorated by the Vatican for his scientific achieve-\nments.\nTo be quite fair, in developing his theory of the expanding universe, Lemaitre had relied\non the principles of general relativity. But, since he was also well versed in the discipline of\ntheology, could he not also have come across that great medieval commentary on Biblical\nScripture known as the Ramban? In 1990, in a book titled Genesis and the Big Bang, the Is-\nraeli nuclear physicist Gerald Schroeder argued in detail that there is no contradiction to be\nfound between the account of creation as described in Genesis and the current scientific dic-\ntum.\u201d\u00b0 Moreover, as Schroeder noted, \u201cthe Ramban ... had the remarkably modern insight\nthat at the moment after creation, all the matter in the universe must have been concentrated\nin a tiny speck.\u201d\u201d\u201d Tell me that this insight is not identical to that reached by Lemaitre?\nI hope no one will now think that I, personally, believe that Creation as described in\nGenesis is a veiled description of the Big Bang since, as I hope to demonstrate in a future\nwork, Ihave an entirely different theory to propose concerning the shedding of light by",
