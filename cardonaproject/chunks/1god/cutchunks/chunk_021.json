In this case the\ngloss was made to indicate \u201cSame u-mi\u201d\u2014i.e. \u201cSama of the day.\u201d\u00ae\nIn fact, variants of the name Shamash still mean \u201csun\u201d in many modern Semitic lan-\nguages.\u201d Thus, in Hebrew, the common word for \u201csun\u201d is shemesh. Among the Aramaeans\nthe word was also rendered SemeS (shemesh) or SimSa (shimsha).* In pre-Islamic times, the\nArabic word was SamSu (Shamshu).* Even in Maltese, the only European language with a\ndistinctive Semitic root-base, the Sun is called xemx,\u201d where the \u201cx\u201d is phonetically equiva-\nlent to \u201csh\u201d \u2014thus shemsh.\nAll of this raises some very interesting questions. Why, for instance, was the planet Sat-\nurn called by the same name as the Sun? It is not as if the Babylonians had no other names\nfor Saturn\u2014we have already encountered two: En-Me Sar-ra and (Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-US. But\nalso, ancient names, unlike some modern ones, carried their own meanings. No one in those\ndays would have thought of naming a person or an object by using lexical abstraction.\nShemesh, and therefore Shamash, means \u201cto be brilliant,\u201d* and while this may be an apt\nname for the Sun, one would hardly think of alluding to the pin-point of light that is Saturn\nby the same appellation. And yet this is precisely what the Babylonians did. As Jastrow was\nforced to conclude, \u201cthe fact that Saturn was also called the \u2018sun\u2019 is vouched for, both by ex-\nplanatory notes attached to astrological connotations, and by notices in classical writings to\nthat effect.\u201d\u00ae Thus, while we understand that Shamash was the name of the planet Saturn as\nwell as the Sun, is it also to be understood that Saturn was once believed to have been as\nbrilliant as the Sun?\nTHE LIGHT OF THE GODS\nThe close relationship, or quasi-synonymy, between the planet Saturn and the Sun was\nnot, in Mesopotamia, restricted to the Babylonian Shamash. The Sumerian planetary god\nNinurta also shared this dual characteristic. Thus Stephen Langdon could speak of \u201cthe sun-\ngod Ninurta\u201d in one breath while claiming in the next that, in Sumero-Babylonian religion,\nNinurta was \u201cthe war god and planet Saturn.\u201d\u201d It was even said of Ninurta that his face was\nShamash.\u201d\nTogether with many other deities, Ninurta has often been presented by mythologists as a\nstorm god. This view owes its origin to the texts themselves in which Ninurta is lauded as u\nsur me-a* or, in Sumerian, as Lugal-e ud me-l\u00e9m-bi nir-gal.\u00ae In the past, these epithets had\nbeen translated as \u201cthe most furious storm (or stormwind)\u201d and \u201cKing, Storm whose bril-",

When a reason is given, it usually runs some-\nthing like the following: Nimrod, sometimes called Nebrod, the traditional founder of Baby-\nlon, was \u201cthe first to become king on earth...and took as title the name of the planet Kronos\n[which was Saturn].\u201d* Nimrod, however, did not have to take the name of the planet Saturn\nbecause his name was already that of Saturn. Thus, for instance, Nimrod has also, and often,\nbeen claimed to be an alias of Ninurta.\u201d The actual truth, however, is that the two names are\nreally one and the same. The cuneiform characters which spell nin, ur, and ta can also be\nread nim, ru, and ud respectively\u201d \u2014which can be said to be the same syllables in reverse\nand which, of course, spell \u201cnimru-ud,\u201d a name that has been popularized as \u201cNimrod.\u201d*\n\nOf course, it is not only in legendary tales, such as those dealing with Nimrod, that Saturn\nwas lauded as king\u2014often the very first king the world had ever known. As we have already\nseen above, in the original, that is older, sources, Ninurta/Saturn is himself proclaimed\nlugal\u2014that is \u201cking.\u201d And this, again, is in keeping with the mytho-historical record since all\nof the Saturnian deities were revered as kings, the first of their line.\n\nFormerly, when the decipherment of cuneiform was still in its infancy and the translitera-\ntion of the Mesopotamian deities had not yet been formalized, the name Ninurta was vari-\nously read as Ninib, Ninip, or simply Nin, a title which has been translated as meaning\n\u201cLord,\u201d although it also stands for \u201cLady.\u201d\u201d (And is it because of this that Fred Bratton\nlisted Ninurta as a fertility goddess,\u201d or was this merely a typographical error?) Thus,\nscholars of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were wont to refer to this astral\ndeity by one, or more, of the above names. Writing in 1885, George Rawlinson opted for Nin",

However, the same cuneiform sign also stood for \u201cking.\u201d* But, more\nthan that, the very same ideogram was also used to \u201cspell\u201d the name of the great Sumerian\ngod An (or Anu)\u201d who\u2014as the father of all the gods, the \u201cHead of the older generation of\ngods,\u201d standing at the beginning of every theological list from all periods*\u2014can also be\nunderstood as a personification of the Saturnian deity.\n\nMore in keeping with our subject, we also find Ninib lauded as \u201cthe light of heaven and\nearth\u201d and, quite explicitly, as \u201che who, like the sun, the light of the gods, irradiates the na-\ntions.\u201d\n\nThere is, again, no point in claiming that these were metaphorical epithets meant to be\napplied to the god and not the planet he represented because, to the ancients who venerated\nhim, the god and the planet was one and the same. And this, incidentally, is not merely my\ncontention. Conventional mythologists had recognized this fact for themselves even though\nthey found it very difficult to accept. Thus Peter Jensen was forced to see in Saturn an an-\ncient symbol of the \u201ceastern sun\u201d or \u201cthe sun on the horizon,\u201d\u00ae without however offering a\nsingle piece of evidence for this interpretation. George Rawlinson himself found these epi-\nthets \u201cvery difficult to reconcile with the notion that, as a celestial luminary, [Ninip] was Sat-\nurn.\u201d*' Somewhat like Jensen, he, also, sought to explain the situation by appealing to astral\nbodies other than the one indicated by the texts themselves. As he wrote: \u201cThese phrases ap-\npear to point to the Moon, or to some very brilliant star, and are scarcely reconcilable with\nthe notion that [Ninip] was the dark and distant Saturn.\u201d\u00ae\n\nElsewhere, and earlier, Rawlinson had indicated the same bewilderment when he asked:\n\u201cHow is it possible that the dark and distant planet Saturn can answer to the luminary who\n[or which] \u2018irradiates the nations like the sun, the light of the gods\u2019?\u201d\u00ae\n\nNINGIRSU\n\nOther than earlier readings of the name Ninurta as Nin, Ninib, Ninip, etc., the deity in\nquestion possessed some bona fide aliases, one of which was Ningirsu*\u2014the Lord of Girsu\n(in Lagash).\u00a9 This is ascertained by the Gula Hymn of Bullutsa-rabi in which the consort of\nthe goddess Gula (also known as Bau and/or Nin-Karrak)\u00ae is called by various names among",
