Actually,\nthe implication derived from the mytho-historical record is that there was a time\nwhen not even Saturn was yet quite visible. The record, for instance, hints at a time\nwhen the unseen god was still to emerge from an all-encompassing darkness. Mankind con-\ntinued to remember this as the time of beginnings, a time before Creation commenced. Thus\nthe later compilers of the Rig Veda could philosophically state that, before there were any\ngods, there was neither \u201cexistent\u201d nor \u201cnon-existent.\u201d\u2019 And yet there was something which\nwas described in the same source as \u201cthat One Thing\u201d and \u201cthis All.\u201d As it is stated: \u201cThat\nOne Thing, breathless, breathed by its own nature: apart from it was nothing whatsoever.\u201d\u201d\n|    | ad Saturn always been visible in the sky as far as mankind was concerned? Actually,\nAnd:\n\u201cDarkness there was: at first concealed in darkness this All was indiscriminated\nchaos. All that existed then was void and formless.\u201d\nAs we shall soon see, this all-encompassing darkness is spoken of by the mythologies of\nalmost all races. In fact, this milieu is stressed so often that one cannot help but assume that\nfew situations impressed early man as much as this prolonged environmental state. And yet, in\nthis darkness, up in the sky, there seems to have been something indistinct, the \u201cvoid and\nformless\u201d substance of the Rig Veda.\nTOHU WA BOHU\nAs David Talbott noted from the very inception of his Saturnian studies, man described\nthe creation of what has been termed \u201cthe earth\u201d as if he had been an actual witness to it all.\nHe was there when it happened and saw it all unveil with his very own eyes.\u2018 Some will\ncounter that this was the natural outcome of man\u2019s budding philosophical yearning. Looking\naround him, we are told, man would eventually have fallen upon the question of how every-\nthing had come to be. But, apart from the fact that the doctrine of beginnings was not univer-\nsally adhered to, why would all those races who believed in Creation have described it in",

    "content": "\nsimilar, if not near-identical, terms? The answer, of course, has to do with the fact that the\nmythic tales of Creation have always been misunderstood. Let us then continue to re-examine\nthem.\nThe father of all Creation myths, at least in the Western World, is that contained in the\nvery first chapter of the Book of Genesis. It is there stated that:\n\u201cIn the beginning Elohim created the shemayim and \u2018eretz. And \u2018eretz was tohu wa\nbohu, and darkness was on the surface of the tehom. And the ruach of Elohim moved\nupon the face of the mayim.\u201d*\nAs we have already seen, Elohim was one of the ancient names of Saturn. Shemayim are\n\u201cthe heavens\u201d\u2014in the plural. Eretz is the word usually translated as \u201cEarth,\u201d but it more\nthe plural.\nproperly means \u201cland.\u201d The words tohu wa bohu are traditionally translated as \u201cwithout form\nand void\u201d or \u201cvoid and empty.\u201d The tehom is understood as a watery abyss\u2014the deep. Ruach\nmeans \u201cspirit\u201d or \u201csoul,\u201d but also \u201cwind,\u201d while the mayim are merely \u201cthe waters\u201d \u2014also in\nWhat follows might offend those of a religious bent but, in a scholarly work, this cannot\nalways be helped. Devoid of all religious significance, what the words of Genesis actually\ntell us is that, \u201cin the beginning\u201d \u2014that is, as far back as man can remember\u2014Saturn fash-\nioned the \u201cland\u201d\u2014which originally meant the land of the gods\u2014which was formless and\nempty, while the \u201cspirit,\u201d or \u201cwind,\u201d of the same Saturn moved over the darkened waters.\nCHAOS\nTohu wa bohu, however, can also mean \u201cutter chaos.\u201d\u00b0 Thus, in the Phoenician cosmog-\nony of Philo Byblius, we find \u201cdark chaos\u201d presiding as the ruling principle before Creation.\u2019\nIt was no different among the ancient Greeks. In describing the Creation as remembered\nby his countrymen, Hesiod asks: \u201cFrom the beginning, which first came to be?\u201d And he an-\nswers: \u201cChaos was first of all...\u201d \u00ae Thus, according to Hesiod, in the beginning there was\nnothing but Chaos, \u201cvast and dark.\u201d This Chaos was surrounded by Night,'\u00b0 which means\nsurrounded by, or enveloped in, darkness.\nGuirand tells us that, among the Greeks, Chaos was \u201ca pure cosmic principle devoid of\ngod-like characteristics.\u201d'' In this, however, he was simply falling prey to a later philosophic\ndoctrine. Guirand also muddles the issue when he claims that \u201cthe first principle was Cronus,\nor Time, from which came Chaos, which symbolized the infinite...\u201d!? It is obvious that, here,",

Oh\nhow still it is and formless, standing alone without changing, reaching everywhere\nwithout suffering harm. Its name I know not.

Moreover, this thing called Tao was believed to be located \u201cabout the celestial pole\nwhich was considered to be the seat of power because all revolves about it.\u201d!?
