Thus we find it recorded in\nGudea\u2019s Cylinder B:\n\u201cNingirsu...rose in overwhelming splendor. In the land it became day; the Eninnu\n[another epithet of the god] rivaled in brilliance the child of Enzu.\u201d\u00ae\nThis Enzu, also read Zu-en, was the more familiar Sin. His \u201cchild\u201d was Shamash, often\nreferred to as Shamash mar Sin \u2014i. e. Shamash son of Sin.\u00ae\nThis led William Albright to state that \u201cNingirsu is here the sun...who ascends each\nmorning from the underworld.\u201d\u201d That Albright was not well acquainted with the character-\nistics of this deity is further illustrated when he also opined that \u201cNingirsu, like Ninurta,\nseems to have been primarily a god of fertility with intimate solar associations.\u201d\u201d Albright\ndid recognize that Ningirsu has \u201csolar associations,\u201d but that Ningirsu was Saturn and not the\nSun had already been demonstrated by Jastrow.\u201d\nThis identification is based on a series of deductions which not only proves the ancient\nidentity of Ningirsu but also that of Ninurta. These deductions lead us back to those omens\nincorporating the formula \u201cwhen Shamash stands in the halo of Sin\u201d that we have already\nhad occasion to note. Apart from the gloss already there discussed, which explains that\nShamash is the name of the planet Saturn (Lu-Bat Sag-US), we also come across a clarifica-\ntion which names Ninib/Ninurta as \u201cstanding therein.\u201d\u201d This indicates, beyond any reason-\nable doubt, that Ninib/Ninurta was the same as Lu-Bat Sag-US/Shamash/Saturn.\u201d As Donald\nMackenzie noted: \u201cThe sun god was identical with Ninip and Nin-Girsu...and resembling\nBabbar, \u2018the shining one,\u2019 the solar deity of Akkadian Sippar, whose Semitic name was\nShamash.\u201d\u201d Also, in a slab relief of the god retrieved from the temple of Ninurta in ancient\nKalakh (or Kalhu), present-day Nimrud (still named after the very god), Ninurta is depicted\nwith the scythe as one of his weapons. As is widely known, the scythe was the favored\nweapon of Kronos/Saturnus. Thus, as Jastrow admitted, Franz Kugler was correct in identify-\ning \u201cthe planet (Lu-Bat) whose name is Ninib [i.e. Ninurta]\u201d as referring to Saturn.\u201d And,\nlet\u2019s face it, in a bilingual list of the planets, now in the British Museum, Ninurta is definitely\nlisted as the name of the planet Saturn.\u201d\nNow it should be understood that the term \u201cLu-Bat\u201d was also used to designate Mars and\nMercury besides Saturn. A. F. O\u2019D Alexander, however, misunderstood the usage of this\nterm when he stated that a \u201cfurther ambiguity was caused by using Jubad [the same as Lu-\nterm when he stated that a \u201cfurther ambiguity was caused by using lubad [the same as Lu-\nBat] (\u2018planet\u2019) sometimes for Saturn, sometimes for Mercury.\u201d\u2122 What Alexander should",

As\nJastrow however pointed out, the listing of Ningirsu as an alias of Ninurta leaves no doubt as\nto which Lu-Bat\u2014i.e. which planet\u2014is intended.

    "content": "(For those in the know: The association of Ninurta with Nergal, as also with the Greek\nHerakles, will be discussed in a future volume.)\n\nTHE TRUE SUN\n\nLike that of other ancient nations, Hindu astronomy is inseparable from mythology. This\nparticular mythology, however, continues to thrive as the basis of Hindu religion. In a way, it\ncan therefore be said that, among the Hindus, planetary worship is practiced to this day\u2014and\nnot only in an indirect way. Here I would like to remind the reader of that passage from the\nLinga Purana we had earlier looked at which admonishes that \u201cthe worship of the planets\nshould be pursued by good men.\u201d Moreover, the reason behind this admonition is the ward-\ning-off of evil at times of planetary \u201charassment.\u201d That, in these modern times, not many\npracticing Hindus are even aware of these words, and that few, if any, among them actually\npractice planetary worship, is besides the point. What is at issue here is that the admonition in\nquestion is contained in one of the missals, if you wish, by which one of the world\u2019s great\nliving religions is meant to abide.\n\nLike the gods of other nations, Vedic deities are known by more than one name or epithet\nas so, also, are the planets. Thus, one of the names for the Sun in Sanskrit is Arka.\u00ae But then\nwe find that three related designations for the planet Saturn in the same language are Arki,\u201d\nArka-putra,\u201d and Arkatanayah.\u00ae Both Arka-putra and Arkatanayah translate as \u201cson of the\nSun.\u201d \u00a9 Arkaja, which means \u201csun-born\u201d can also be applied to the planet Saturn,\u201d as so,\nalso, can Arkanandana.\u201d So, once again, we find the planet Saturn bearing a name which is\nshared by the Sun.\n\nHindu mythology, of course, is largely based on Vedic belief. And yet, as one critic\npointed out quite a few years ago, it has never been proved to the general satisfaction of In-\ndologists that any planets are mentioned in the Vedas.\u201d As I had earlier written in reference\nto this criticism, however, this lack can be compensated for \u201cif it can be shown that certain\ndeities mentioned in the [Vedic] hymns possess planetary traits and/or characteristics com-\nparable to the [known] planetary deities of other nations.\u201d\u00ae Today I can go even further be-\ncause, if it can be shown that the names and/or epithets applied to the Vedic deities are iden-\ntical to those applied to the planets by the same race and in the same language, the equiva-\nlence of deities and planets is proven on home ground without any recourse or appeal to\ncomparative studies. Such, for instance, is the case with Brahma, the supreme creator of In-\ndian mythology.\n\nStrictly speaking, Brahma was not a Vedic deity. He more properly belongs to that corpus\nof Hindu lore known as Brahmanic mythology. He was proclaimed the first of the Devas,\nusually said to mean \u201cgods,\u201d but which properly translates as \u201cshining ones. Here it should\nbe noted that the Sanskrit adjective brahmanya means \u201crelating [or belonging] to Brahma. \u201d*",

Maybe so. But, as in the\ncase of the Egyptian Ra, Surya is described as having motions and characteristics which do\nnot fit those of the Sun. Thus, to give but one example (and, later, I shall be giving others),\nSurya is said to have occupied samanam dhama, which means \u201cthe same place of rising and\nsetting.\u201d\"\u00ae Everyone knows that the Sun does not rise and set in the same place. (How this\noddity, in turn, applies to the primeval Saturn will be explained in a later chapter of this\nwork.)\nLet me, however, be a little more specific. Surya is also termed Suraj.

Despite their star maps, charts, and cal-\nendars, when it comes to the planets and their motions, nothing has survived from pre-Alex-\nandrian Egypt that would allow us to claim an astronomical achievement on their part.\nOn the other hand, if conventional mythologists can treat of deities like Horus and Ra as\nsolar representations, with the likes of Isis and Hathor as lunar or Venerian ones, then so are\nwe allowed to treat them as celestial bodies. In fact, as already noted, ask any mythologist to\nname the solar god par excellence and the name of Ra (or Re) is bound to come up.
