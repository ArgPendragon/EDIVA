As Bahcall stated, \u201ca real deficit of solar neutrinos exists.\u201d\u00b0 Danylo Hawaleshka went\none step further: \u201cOne possible explanation [for this lack of neutrinos] is that prevailing theo-\nries of how the sun works are wrong \u2014which, if true, would turn astrophysics upside down.\u201d\u201d\nIt is not that astrophysicists have not attempted to explain the mystery of the missing\nneutrinos, but only by pre-supposing solar elements which are themselves undetected\u2014such\nas assuming that the interior of the Sun is cooler than otherwise believed;* that neutrinos in-\nteract with undetected particles nick-named \u201cwimps\u201d;\u2019 or that \u201cthe sun is undergoing a tem-\nporary lull in activity.\u201d\"\u00b0 But, as Bahcall noted: \u201cNone of these models has proved to be con-\nsistent with all the observed characteristics of the sun.\u201d'' And: \u201cNone of the modified models\nis fully consistent with the well-established physics, and each involves ad hoc assumptions\ndesigned primarily to accommodate the observed neutrino fluxes.\u201d\u201d\u201d\nWorse, however, was to come when, at the Neutrino \u201890 conference held at CERN near\nGeneva, came the news that what was then the latest experiment (known as SAGE) carried\nout by a joint team from the then Soviet Union and the United States detected no solar neu-\ntrinos at all!\u201d\nA second example concerns the Big Bang theory which demands a vaster amount of\nmatter in the universe than has so far been detected. This was made clear in 1932 when Jan\nOort attempted to calculate the mass required to produce the observed motion of stars outside\nthe visible disc of the Galaxy. His calculations showed that the actual mass of the Galaxy\nwas 50% less than required by theory.\u2019* This was confirmed by Fritz Zwicky who, on meas-\nuring the velocities of galaxies within the Coma cluster, came to the realization that \u201cthere",

As Marcia Bartusiak reported, this\nwas no contest since astronomers were not about to accept the radical suggestion that New-\nton\u2019s law of gravitation tended to break down with distance.\u2019\u00ae As Lawrence Krauss admitted:\n\u201cIt may be slightly radical to suggest that galaxies are dominated by dark matter.

The theory thus required the same amount of matter\nthat the gravitational model of the universe demanded.\u201d' But where was this dark matter hid-\ning? What did it consist of? As Halton Arp explained:\n\u201cHypotheses include everything from subatomic particles like neutrinos to dark rocks\nsurrounding galaxies...But in actuality, postulating undetected matter is equivalent to\ninventing observations that do not exist in order to explain contradictions to our cur-\nrently assumed physical laws...\u201d\u201d\nIt is not that dark matter is not being looked for. Just as in the case of the elusive neutri-\nnos, sensitive detectors arrayed around the world are waiting to register this enigmatic stuff\nnow said to be made up of subatomic particles and to constitute 90% of the universe.\u201d As of\nthis writing, not a single one of these detectors has succeeded in registering a single particle\nof dark matter.\nDouglas Lin tried a different method. With his colleagues, Lin set about comparing pho-\ntographs of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a neighboring galaxy, taken in 1974 with others\ntaken in 1989, and measuring \u201cthe almost imperceptible distance\u201d that \u201csome 250 stars\u201d had",

And was this the same as detecting the actual missing mass?\n\nLin himself suggested that the missing mass \u201clies in a halo of dark matter extending\n300,000 light-years or more from our galactic center.\u201d\u201d\u201d A suggestion, however, is one thing;\ndirect proof is something else. As an editorial comment in New Scientist summed it all up\nthat same year, belief in dark matter is akin to that of 19th century scientists who believed in\nthe just as nebulous existence of aether.\u201d\n\nThese two theories\u2014the nuclear fueling of the Sun and the Big Bang\u2014should not, there-\nfore, be allowed to stand, but because science is still optimistic in that it will eventually de-\ntect both the missing neutrinos and the missing dark matter, they are allowed to stand. Per-\nsonally, I shall not be using similar optimism as a crutch in an endeavor to validate the Sat-\nurnian model we have been slowly reconstructing. On the contrary, I aim to present a series\nof demands which this theory raises, both within itself and also through hard science, and\nhow these can be met.\n\nINTERNAL CONSISTENCY\n\nThe first demand of our theory is an obvious one. Seeing as our model has been con-\nstructed on the strength of the mytho-historical record, the theory demands that the mytho-\nhistorical record should be internally consistent. There would be no point in constructing a\nmodel based on a record if that same record contains items which contradict the model being\nconstructed. If the model being constructed is to be considered valid, the record on which it is\nbased must be able to test itself.\n\nAs we have seen, we commenced the construction of our model by zeroing in on the an-\ncient belief that, once upon a time, to use an old clich\u00e9, the planet Saturn was the most\nprominent body in Earth\u2019s sky.\n\nIn order for this datum to be accepted, however, the record should contain additional data\nwhich tell us how the planet Saturn could have appeared as the most prominent body in the\nsky. This demand was met when we found it stated in the same record that Saturn had previ-\nously shone as a sun; that it was at that time the only visible body in the sky; and that it was",
