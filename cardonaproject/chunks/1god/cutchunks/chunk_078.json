    "content": "\nEpilogue\nSCALING UP AND DOWN\nt is not reasonable to expect a work of this scope to be entirely free of error. But, relying\non an old clich\u00e9, I hope no one will end up throwing out the baby with the bath water if\nsuch errors are discerned. I also reserve the right to amend what might in future be found\nto be amiss with the conclusions reached in this work. I will in no way be embarrassed if I\nhave to retract whatever is found not to fit the general hypothesis presented herein. That is\nthe way theories are supposed to be formed. That is the only way science can progress. I\nknow this work will run its gamut of criticism. I am prepared for that. After all, if what I have\npresented bears any semblance to what really transpired in the past, the tenets of various sci-\nentific disciplines will have to be reconsidered. Such revisionist work will not sit well with\nthe old guard. But, to use another old clich\u00e9, do not mistake me for a lonely voice in the de-\nsert. I am not alone in most of what I have so far presented. I belong to an ever-growing\nschool of interdisciplinarians who have immersed themselves in the above and related stud-\nies. The old guard will eventually pass away, as it always does. It is to younger minds that\nthe future is bequeathed. In the meantime, I put a gun to no one\u2019s head, so believe what you\nwill.\nThe main problem with the reconstruction of these hoary events lies with plasma cosmol-\nogy which, ironically, serves as the best evidence in favor of their occurrence. As in other\nmatters touched upon in this work, once again, this is not to be wondered at. Despite Hannes\nAlfv\u00e9n\u2019s pioneering work in the 1930s, and Anthony Peratt\u2019s more recent seminal disclo-\nsures!, plasma cosmology is still in its infancy. As the latter confessed in 1992:\n\u201cBecause of their strong interaction with electromagnetism, plasmas display a com-\nplexity in structure and motion that far exceeds that found in matter in the gaseous,\nliquid, or solid states. For this reason, plasmas, especially their electrodynamic prop-\nerties, are far from understood.\u201d2\nGranted that plasma science has progressed immensely since then, its exact behavior in\nrelation to astronomy remains temporarily controversial. Worse still, proponents of the proto-\nSaturnian model are not all of one mind when it comes to the mechanics involved in keeping\nthe configuration stacked up in linear formation. And this entails the exact nature of proto-\nSaturn\u2019s polar column. The main contestant of the specific nature of this column as adduced\nin the foregoing pages stems from the fertile mind of Wallace Thornhill whose knowledge of\nplasma physics ranks him among the best in the field. It behooves us, therefore, to take his\nobjections seriously enough to comment at some length about them.\nThus, for instance, not only does Thornhill not believe in brown dwarf jets, he even\ndoubts the ejection of brown dwarfs from stars. True, as we have seen, he had previously\nstated that in his humble opinion, HH 34 is spitting out objects \u201cwhich might become\u201d indi-\nvidual brown dwarfs.3 A day later, however, he revised his opinion by claiming that such a",

Nor would it have been possible for it to\nhave provided Earth with light, feeble or otherwise, let alone enough heat to generate and\nharbor life.5\nWhat, then, can be said against this? Speaking of the plasma experiments he conducted,\nAlfv\u00e9n asked: \u201cIf we can extrapolate from the laboratory to the solar system, which is a hun-\ndred trillion times larger in extent, then why shouldn\u2019t plasma still behave the same way for\nthe entire observable universe\u2014another hundred trillion times larger?\u201d\u00ae I point this out here\nbecause, if it is allowable to scale up from laboratory experiments to the Solar System, and\nfrom the Solar System to the Universe, it must then be allowable, as it really is, to scale down\nfrom stellar masses to brown dwarf stars and even lower to sub-brown dwarfs. As Don Scott\npointed out:\n\u201cThe differences in scale (as Tony [Peratt] has tried to point out MANY times) are\ncompletely unimportant. They all work the same way.\u201d7\nScaling down, however, involves more than just size and mass. It also involves ampli-\ntude, and thus luminosity, as well as distance and even speed, to say nothing of time. All\nelements must be scaled down, and not necessarily all by the same percentage. Thus, when\nthe knots in an astral jet are scaled down to sub-brown dwarf proportions, they will no longer\nbe as bright as stars, but, at best, only as bright as the sub-brown dwarf that spawns them.\nAnd even then, this only holds true for the knot\u2019s initial inception. If the sub-brown dwarf\nthat was proto-Saturn eventually turned into the gaseous planet we now know by that name,\nwhat is there against assuming that its knots would eventually turn into rocky terrestrial plan-\nets? The light-years distance which separates jet condensations from their stellar parents\nwould also then be scaled down to more modest stretches. Besides, does not Thornhill accept\nthat proto-Saturn had been a brown dwarf star? Does he not himself interpret proto-Saturn\u2019s\npolar column as a sustained plasma discharge in the form of Birkeland current? And has he\nBirkeland current?\nnot also told us that astral jets are a more active and visible manifestation of the same\nAt the risk of befuddling the reader, this is the manner in which Thornhill extricated him-\nself from the above dilemma:\n\u201cInstead of being a small but normal stellar anode in the galactic discharge, and ac-\ncepting electrons, proto-Saturn would find itself a cathode, ejecting electrons, once it\nentered the Sun\u2019s more positively charged domain. Proto-Saturn was then no longer a\nstar by definition. It was a comet! So it could not, by definition or physics, have de-",

Instead it would have developed a cometary tail as soon\nas its Langmuir sheath was enveloped in the heliosphere.\u201d\u00ae\nAre cometary tails, however, really that different from astral jets? I realize, of course, that\nthis is a question that will leave astrophysicists aghast. And no, I am not claiming that comets\nare akin to stars. I am only here concerned with the fabric of their tails. So consider: It has\nnow been conceded for some time that electricity and magnetism are central to the under-\nstanding of what a comet really is.? The sunward spikes that some comets display have also\nbeen understood as electrical discharges '!\u00b0\u2014and would not these spikes, in conjunction with\nthe tails, make for a similar situation to a bipolar flow? Like stars, to say nothing of brown\ndwarfs, comets are now known to emit X-rays.!!

Or, phrased differently, if a celestial body as puny as a\ncomet can emit a plasma jet, why not a much more massive brown dwarf star? Does this not\ntend to emphasize Peratt\u2019s contention, mentioned above, that the differences in scale are\ncompletely unimportant? Do not all celestial bodies, as Scott phrased it, act the same way?\nFair enough, as we have seen, everything is made of plasma but, as Ken Moss saw fit to re-\nmind me, apples are still not oranges.\nTrue\u2014but they are both fruit.\nAs Thornhill pointed out, however, astral jets travel.2\u00b0 Time-lapse photographs of the jet\nfrom Herbig-Haro 30, taken a year apart, are said to indicate that it is squirting outward \u201cat\nvelocities close to the speed of light\u201d while stretching \u201cfor many millions of light-years.\u201d?!\nOthers, however, have settled for \u201cseveral hundred kilometers per second,\u201d while stretching",

The knots, or condensations, in cometary tails also travel down the tail, and quick suc-\ncession of photographs indicate that they move at speeds up to 250 kilometers per second\n(540,000 miles an hour). Their motion, however, is erratic, with the acceleration \u201cturning on\nand off capriciously,\u201d as it varies with time. In fact, some knots have \u201cvery little speed or ac-\nceleration\u201d and, as Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan reported, their motion \u201cis as unpredictable as\nthe weather.\u201d?3 Moreover, while cometary tails lengthen as they near the Sun, they do not\ntravel away from the nucleus at velocities close to the speed of light. As scaled-down ver-\nsions of astral jets, their size and velocity of emission are reduced in keeping with their mod-\nest amplitudes.\nWorse still is that not all knots are seen to travel down astral jets. Comparisons of images\nfrom 1934 to 1980 of the jet spawned by M87 show that the knots, or hot spots, imbedded in\nit did not move. It cannot therefore be a law of plasma physics that knots in jets must\ntravel.\nOf more importance to our study, when it comes to galaxies, Jayant Narlikar and P. K.\nDas showed in 1980 that \u201cas the particles in the ejected matter gain mass, they slow down in\norder to conserve momentum.\u201d In other words, they decelerate, and even come to a halt5 As\nArp added: \u201cThe Narlikar-Das calculations apply to the most favorable case for escape from\nthe ejecting galaxy\u201d and this material exits \u201calong the minor axis,\u201d which is the axis of rota-\ntion.26 We are here, therefore, speaking of galactic jets. And if galactic jets can decelerate,\nand even come to a halt, so, therefore, can stellar and sub-stellar jets.",
