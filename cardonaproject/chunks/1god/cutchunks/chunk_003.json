As we have seen, despite the odd dissenter, modern opinion mainly reflects that of the\nGreeks themselves who seem to have attained a degree of unanimity\u2014by no means the ac-\ncustomed expectancy\u2014on this particular subject. Let us not, after all, forget that the very\nword \u201ctragedy,\u201d in Greek tragodia, means nothing more than \u201cgoat song,\u201d derived from tra-\ngos, that is \u201cgoat,\u201d the sacred animal of Dionysus. Despite its enigmatic name, the goat song\nitself was sung in honor of Dionysus, describing his birth and violent end. That the term\n\u201cgoat song\u201d \u2014 tragodia\u2014became a synonym for \u201cmisfortune\u201d is therefore understandable.\nChristians, if no one else, can at least understand this much: What could be more tragic than\nthe violent death of a god?\nORALITY\nMyths and rituals originated in the days before the invention of writing. Prior to that,\nmyths were handed down orally. That having been said, the next question the critic will ask\nis: How reliable can a report of anything be if it has been handed down orally for an untold\nnumber of years before it was even written down? And, to be sure, the reliability of oral\ntradition has been the subject of controversy since the time of Euhemerus.*\nIn our own world, as we all know, different eyewitnesses are liable to offer different ver-\nsions of any single event even when the reports are collected within a very short time of the\noccurrence. Not only that, but, with each telling, each report becomes more embellished until\nall semblance of truth is muddied beyond recognition. Can you imagine the reliability of such\nreports being handed down by word-of-mouth over a few thousand years?\nAnd yet, as Dorothy Vitaliano shrewdly observed, how often have parents retold a bed-\ntime story only to be found corrected if they deviate by as much as a single word from the\noriginal version told? Such is the power of oral tradition\u2014as notice, to give but one example,",

    "content": "\nthe accuracy with which the people of sub-Saharan Africa managed to preserve their history,\nwithout the aid of a written language, up until the advent of the colonial period.\u201c\nAs Peter Hallberg pointed out in relation to the Icelandic skalds, when history is transmit-\nted through a succession of professional bards with highly trained memories and powers of\ntecollection, there is reason to believe that, when put into writing even after a few centuries,\nthe details remain more than reasonably accurate.* Thus Alfred de Grazia was echoing re-\nceived opinion when he stated:\n\u201cWe know from general anthropology and ancient literature that an exact rendition of\na large body of verse and prose (such as Homer\u2019s Iliad and other epic works) can be\ntransmitted over generations and centuries...[I]n the period of oral transmission,\ntrained speakers can memorize and reproduce exactly thousands of lines heard from\nthe lips of a teacher.\u201d\nTo paraphrase Peter Warlow\u2019s astute words, the main secret behind the retention and im-\nmediate recall of any part, or all, of a particular epic, regardless of its enormity of lines, is the\nsystematic learning by rote, or repetition. As he aptly demonstrated, this is made evident by\nthe effortless recall of nursery rhymes learned by rote in early childhood together with other\npoems and quotations drummed into youngsters in school and college. It is by rote, which\nWarlow calls \u201cthe basic way,\u201d that every child learns the complexities of speech, the\nchronological order of the alphabet, the days in the month, multiplication tables, spelling\naids, and other fundamentals in the early garnering of knowledge. He was nowhere near ex-\naggerating when he referred to rote learning as \u201can incredibly powerful technique.\u201d\u201d\nIt has also been hypothesized that the hexameter of Homer\u2019s verses was inherited from an\nearlier oral tradition and that it was this very hexameter that helped preserve the epics.* If\nthis was so, verbatim memorization may not even have been necessary. According to Milman\nParry, the hexameters of poetic sagas such as the Iliad and Odyssey are not simply con-\nstructed of word-units but of formulas. These constitute \u201cgroups of words [co-ordinated pre-\ncisely] for dealing with traditional materials, each formula shaped to fit a hexameter line.\u201d\nThus, for instance, as Walter Ong noted, the phrase \u201cthere spoke out clever Odysseus\u201d\noccurs seventy two times in Homer\u2019s poems.\u201d Such a formula would be easy to remember\nevery time Odysseus is introduced to say something.\nPersonally, I disagree emphatically with Ong when, from this, he also surmises that\nOdysseus was thought of as being clever\u2014\u201cpolymetis\u201d\u2014not because he was supposed to\nhave been, but because \u201cwithout the epithet polymetis he could not be readily worked into the\nmeter.\u201d According to Ong, all of Homer\u2019s characters, including the deities, received their\ntime-worn epithets in order to fit the correct metrical lines of the epics in which they appear.\nThis is difficult to believe when one remembers that the same, or similar, epithets were be-\nstowed on the comparative deities of other nations which appear in poetic sagas employing\nan entirely different meter from that of Homer. In various other cases, deities carry the same,",

Even so, Ong\u2019s forceful\nconclusion need not affect the validity of Parry\u2019s approach.\nIn recent years, an interesting experiment was conducted by Hildegard Wiencke-Lotz\nwho traveled some 45,000 miles through Europe in an all-encompassing effort to track the\nvarious versions of the Gudrun Epic still \u201csung\u201d in those parts and to verify, if possible, the\nhistoricity of its setting and occurrences. Previously believed to be \u201clittle more than a fairy\ntale in three parts, of which the middle part possibly reflected some historical events,\u201d the\nGudrun Epic was demonstrated by Wiencke-Lotz to be \u201can ancient oral tradition representing\na unified whole which loses its meaning when the three parts are considered separately.\u201d* As\nDavid Griffard, relying on notes by William Douglas, as well as the work of Wiencke-Lotz\nherself, was able to report:\n\u201c[Wiencke-Lotz] argues that the entire Gudrun Epic has a sound historical basis and\nthat all specific places mentioned can be found where expected geographically,\nthough their distribution covers a large geographical area. She has identified and vis-\nited the numerous places named in the tales and has traced the specific period of Gu-\ndrun\u2019s life in relation to Roman history.\u201d\u00ae\nWhat emerged from this study is that the epic is exclusively indigenous to those territo-\nries which had, at one time or another, been occupied by the Goths. This conclusion received\nconfirmation through the archaeological discoveries of the countries involved\u2014 Yugoslavia",

Those who could became scribes, valuable\nto the court and temples as record keepers. The English word \u201cpaper\u201d is derived from the Greek name\nof the sedge-like plant, the papyrus, the stalks of which were pressed together into a sheet of writing\nmaterial which was then smoothed with a stone. Despite its many advantages, the invention of writing\ncarried with it at least one major disadvantage \u2014it no longer necessitated the memorizing of past events.\n(Illustration by John Green.)\nMost ingenious Theuth [Thoth] ... one man has the ability to begat arts but the ability\nto judge of their usefulness or harmfulness ... belongs to another; and now you, who\nare the father of letters, have been led, by your affection to ascribe to them a power\nthe opposite of that which they really possess. For this invention will produce\nforgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice\ntheir memory. Their trust in writing ... will discourage the use of their own memory\n... You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your\npupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom, for they will read many things\nwithout instruction and will therefore seem to know many things, when they are for\nthe most part ignorant ... \u201d*\nThus, when it came to things past, the later Egyptians read the texts bequeathed by their\nancestors but did not always understand what the written words alluded to, for they had not\nwitnessed what their ancestors had.
