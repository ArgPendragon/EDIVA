True, as stated earlier,\nthere is no way in which Saturn could have shone as bright as the Sun but, for the time being,\nwe will allow the Fiote that much. Even so, the question must be asked: How bright could\nSaturn have been?\nHad Saturn, through whatever means, really radiated as a sun, at its present distance it\nwould have been brighter than the full Moon but, in size, it would not have appeared much\nbigger than it presently does. As a star brighter than the full Moon, we can understand why\nthe Assyro-Babylonians could allude to it as the most prominent among the planets. But why\nwould the Saturnian deity, under whatever name, be allotted a place at the head of every an-\ncient pantheon above the much brighter, and definitely more prominent, Sun? Why would\nSaturn have been considered a greater deity than the Sun itself? Because, let us face it, once\nwe appropriate the roles of deities such as Shamash, Atum, Ra, Surya, Helios, Sol, and oth-\ners, as applicable to Saturn, there is no deity of any significance left to fit the Sun. Call it a\ngut feeling for now, but something impels one to believe there was something more to this\nSaturnian sun besides its brightness that compelled the ancients to revere it, inter alia, as the\nr  |  Vhe Fiote of the African Loango Coast believe that the Star Way\u2014which is usually, but\nLord of the Law of the Universe.\nJANUS\nAs I have already stated, ancient astronomical knowledge can be complimented by\nmythology. Much more than that, mythology will end up shouldering the main burden of the\nscenario we are attempting to reconstruct. Allow me then, at this point, to introduce the Latin\ngod Janus and, through him, a series of interconnected deities.\nJuvenal and Prokopios referred to Janus as the \u201cmost ancient of the gods\u201d and \u201cthe first of\nthe ancient gods,\u201d while Herodian called him the \u201cmost ancient indigenous god of Italy.\u201d4\nThis has led mythologists to label Janus as \u201ca uniquely Roman god.\u201d5 Guirand and",

    "content": "\nPierre tell us that Janus \u201cappears in no other mythology.\u201d\u00ae But in his ancient assimilation to\nthe sky, or heaven, he is, in actuality, only the Latin counterpart of the Greek Ouranos. This\nis not to say that the Latins borrowed Janus from the Greeks, any more than the Greeks can\nbe said to have derived their Ouranos from the Vedic Varuna who also, among other things,\nstood for the sky. I use the term \u201csky\u201d here because that is the way mythologists have\ngenerally understood the meaning of the god\u2019s assimilation. But, despite Arthur Cook, who\nidentified so many ancient deities as personifications of the sky, it is quite obvious that by\n\u201csky\u201d something different is indicated. Thus, as reported by Varro, while some authorities\ndid identify Janus as the sky, others were just as confident that the deity personified the uni-\nverse.\u2019 This \u201cuniverse,\u201d \u201csky,\u201d and/or \u201cheaven,\u201d however, was the kosmos of the Greeks, a\nterm which literally meant \u201corder,\u201d \u201charmony,\u201d or \u201can orderly arrangement.\u201d Thus Janus was\nconsidered a \u201cgod of beginnings\u201d\u00ae and ascribed \u201can essential role in the creation of the\nworld,\u201d? which creation is a topic we shall have to reserve for a future work. As Janus Pater,\nthe god was revered as the father of the gods!\u00b0 and god of gods. !!\nIn all the above, Janus bears a close similarity to the Saturnian deities of other nations.\nAre we then saying that Janus was the same as Saturn?\nAN OR ANU\nAccording to Cook, the \u201cmost probable etymology\u201d of the name Janus is derived from a\nseries of related names. Thus he tell us that:\n\u201cCorresponding with the series Diviana Diana Iana we have the series Divianus Di-\nanus lanus (the same as Janus]. Janus, therefore, can be legitimately connected with\ndius (for diuios), a word familiar to us in the phrase sub dio, \u2018under the open sky\u2019.\u201d!?\nThis derivation has been picked up and repeated by other scholars!3 but, to me, it seems\nmore likely that the name Janus owes its origin to a primitive root which also gave us the\nSumero-Babylonian An or Anu, the Greek Ouranos, and the Indic Varuna\u2014all of whom\nwere inter alia assimilated with the mythological sky. This primitive root would then have\nbelonged to a time when, in the words of Max Miiller, \u201cSanskrit was not yet Sanskrit, Greek\nnot yet Greek, but when both, together with Latin, German, and other Aryan dialects, existed\nas yet as one undivided language...\u201d !4\nLike Janus, the Sumerian An was considered the father of all the gods!5 and, like the Sat-\nurnian deities of other nations, he always stood at the beginning of every theological list from\nall periods.!\u00a9 To be sure, An and Anu have always been identified as a personification of the",

Rather than being the sky, Anu creates the sky.!9\nBut is this enough to equate the celestial body that was An as Saturn? We dig further.\nThe god An also appears in Egypt. We find him there as an alias of the god Osiris.\u201d In\nthe \u201cLamentations of Isis and Nephthys,\u201d Isis addresses Osiris as An.2! In a hymn to Osiris\nhe is called the \u201cgod An of millions of years.\u201d22 As we have seen, as the sun of night, Osiris\nis identifiable as Saturn as so, also, is his assimilation with both Atum and Ra. May we there-\nfore claim that so must An be understood?\nOURANOS\nIn Greek mythology, the place of the Latin Janus is taken up by Ouranos, which name the\nLatins rendered as Uranus. In Greek, ouranos means \u201cheaven\u201d but, as E. Tonnelat indicated,\nthis must not be taken to mean that the god\u2019s original function was the personification of the\nsky.?3 The association of Ouranos with the sky might have derived from the fact that an ear-\nlier name for the god seems to have been Epigeios, that is \u201cthe One who is above the\nearth.\u201d4 Plato himself referred to Ouranos as Kosmos,?5 concerning which see above. It was,\nhowever, the Phoenician Sanchoniathon who directly equated Ouranos with Kronos/Saturn.76\nSo also, more recently, Lynn Rose even though his model is at variance with the one being\nconstructed in this work.?/\nVARUNA\nWe find the Indic version of the Greek Ouranos in the person of Varuna. Although the\ncommon identity of these two deities has been said to be exaggerated?8 and even doubtful,29\nGeorges Dum\u00e9zil has gone a long way in establishing the identification.3\u00b0 As Alexander\nMurray tells us in a more recent work:\n\u201cThe name is derived from Var, to cover, or to overarch: and so far Varuna means the\nvault of heaven.
