Thus, despite the different terms in which it is couched, the entity being described, this\nTao, appears to be no different than that described by other races as the first principle from\nwhich Creation was said to have proceeded.\nIt is upon this \u201call-embracing First Principle\u201d that Lao-tzu was able to base an entire\nphilosophy whose influence on Chinese thought, art, and literature, despite varying interpre-\ntation, has been prodigious. Taoism, in fact, became the dominant philosophy, called Tao-\nchia, and even religion, differentiated as Tao-chiao, of China. But that the basic idea behind\nboth derives from the primeval events with which we are presently concerned, there seems to\nbe no doubt.\nTHE NEBULAR CLOUD\nA Yuki Creation myth refers to this indistinct something as a \u201cfog\u201d and/or \u201cfoam\u201d that\n\u201cmoved round and round continually\u201d during a time, in the beginning, when there was yet \u201cno\nlight.\u201d\u201d' A similar fog is also mentioned in Oceanic mythology. From Nias we have the fol-\nlowing: \u201cIn the beginning there was a thick fog, which condensed and became a being without\nspeech or movement or head or arms or legs.\u201d\u201d This being, without head or arms or legs,\nreminds us of the Eskimo entity Ataksak, whom we have already met, who also was a being\nwithout arms and legs and who, very much like the Latin Janus/Saturn, existed in the shape of\na sphere. It should also be noted that, while the entity which emerged from the fog was said to\nhave been without movement, which accords well with Saturn\u2019s immobility, the lack of mo-\ntion does not necessary apply to the fog itself. Here, then, we seem to catch sight of what\nmight have been a spherical body emerging out of a substance which had the appearance of a\nfog.\nIn their Creation myth, the Pima state that:\n\u201cIn the beginning there was nothing at all except darkness. All was darkness and\nemptiness. For a long, long while, the darkness gathered until it became a great mass.\nOver this the spirit of Earth Doctor drifted to and fro like a fluffy bit of cotton in the\nbreeze. Then the Earth Doctor decided to make for himself an abiding place.\u201d\u201d\nIt is obvious that the entity that was eventually translated into English as \u201cEarth Doctor\u201d\nwas the Pima Creator. Meanwhile, a rotating \u201cfog,\u201d \u201cfoam,\u201d and/or \u201cfluffy cotton\u201d in dark-\nness seems to imply a spinning nebular cloud. The whirling nature of this entity is lent fur-\nther support by a Creation myth of the Marquesas Islands which declares that \u201cthe primeval\nvoid started a swelling, a whirling, a vague growth...\u201d This would be in keeping with an",

    "content": "idea proffered by the late David Griffard who, back in 1979, suggested to this author that\nSaturn could conceivably have been \u201censhrouded in some obscuration emanating from the\nparent body itself which blotted out...a good share of its own radiance.\u201d\u00ae This idea seems to\nbe borne out by the Zoroastrian creation myth in which Zurvan was said to have provided, or\nemitted, the \u201coriginal unformed matter.\u201d This is very interesting because, for one thing, the\nIranian Zurvan was a very ancient deity.\u201d He was regarded by the Zoroastrians as the \u201cfirst\nprinciple,\u201d the \u201coriginal seed,\u201d and \u201cthe father of the Cosmos.\u201d\u201d But, more than that, this an-\ncient deity had a well-known identity. Thus, van der Waerden tells us that, in Armenian texts,\nSaturn is called Zruan which is the same as Zurvan.\u201d The later worshippers of Mithra were\nnot therefore wrong when they identified Kronos, the Greek Saturn, with Zurvan.\u201d Actually,\nthe identity of Zurvan as Saturn is well attested.\u2019\n\nThe implication here is that this nebular cloud was spun off by the rotating Saturnian\nbody out of which the solitary deity\u2014i.e. Saturn\u2014slowly emerged into view. A near-identi-\ncal idea was later proposed by David Talbott when he stated that: \u201cThere is also evi-\ndence...that the participating planets [of the Saturnian system] moved through a diffuse\ngaseous envelope, which almost certainly would have prevented a view of the stars.\u201d*\u201d\n\nGriffard\u2019s 1979 suggestion, that an obscuration of sorts could have been emitted by the\nplanet Saturn itself, directed me to the so-called accretion disc, or placental cloud, from\nwhich the planets of the Solar System were supposed to have accreted. Dramatic paintings of\nsuch clouds by noted space artists such as Chesley Bonestell\u00ae have appeared quite regularly\nin astronomical journals and illustrated coffee-table books. Turning such pictures upside\ndown, so that I could view the entire panorama from below instead of from above, gave me\nan inkling of what Saturn might have looked like had it also been surrounded by a similar\nplacental cloud. The sky would have been almost completely obscured by the colossal\nnebular disc. Part of Saturn\u2019s southern hemisphere would have protruded through its\nequatorial cloud, thus rendering itself quite clearly as a dull red disc to human eyes. What\nintrigued me about these graphic illustrations many years later was that these circumstellar\nclouds all had the appearance of a whirlpool that seemed to be composed of both fog and\ndirty foam (and even greenish fluffy cotton), thus rendering them somewhat comparable to\nwhat was described in some of the myths paraded in the previous section.\n\nA similar doughnut of gas was found surrounding a nearby star by space scientists at the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, in 1985.* Dust disks around so-called newborn stars were",

But Nu more properly\nrefers to \u201cthe primordial ocean in which before the creation lay the germs of all things and all\nbeings.\u201d*\n\u201cThe texts call him [i.e. Nu] the \u2018father of the gods,\u2019 but he remains a purely intel-\nlectual concept and had neither temples nor worshippers.

To be sure, this derivation of the name will remain controversial, but\nwe do not really require it in making our case. As Frank Moore Cross has indicated, the idea\nthat Elohim was a god of the sea actually traces to an ancient belief. An old tradition which\nhe cited has the deity unequivocally stating: \u201cI am El, in the seat of Elohim I am enthroned in\nthe midst of the seas.\u201d*\n\nElsewhere, however, the Egyptian Nu\u2014this \u201cprimeval abyss of water\u201d \u2014is alluded to as\npautet or pautti, which has been translated as \u201cprimeval matter.\u201d Thus Ra is made to state: \u201cI\nproduced myself from the primeval matter [which] I made.\u201d \u201cI produced myself from prime-\nval matter.\u201d \u201cI came into being from the primeval matter...\u201d\n\nIt is obvious from all the above that man did not know what he was looking at. If the cir-\ncumstellar disk we have been postulating as having surrounded Saturn was a fact, we can un-\nderstand man remembering it as a nebulosity, something indistinct. We can also understand\nhis likening it to swirling fog, foam, or fluffy cotton, even a churning of mud or slime, a cha-\notic mess, primeval matter\u2014 but water? Why water?\n\nTHE WATERS OF CHAOS\n\nUp until 1979, I had held the view that the waters of chaos had actually been terrestrial.\nIn fact I had already earlier described these waters as having been piled up in a tidal heap due\nto the gravitational pull of Saturn which hovered overhead.\u201d Although I still hold to a col-\nlection of water piled up at Earth\u2019s north polar regions, a topic which will be explored in a\nfuture volume, I eventually came to realize, primarily on following the advice of Roger\nAshton and David Lorton, to reconsider ancient testimony concerning the celestial nature of\nthe waters of chaos spoken of in relation to Creation. The celestial nature of these waters is\nperhaps best indicated in Egyptian myth. Traditionally, the Egyptian waters of chaos which,\nas we have just seen, were collectively known as Nu, were unequivocally described as having\nbeen in the sky. Of that there was never any doubt. As Budge tells us, \u201cthe name Nu...is ex-\npressed by three vases of water which indicate the sound, and the outstretched heaven...and",
