    "content": "\nTHE BOREAL CRADLE\nHeer\u2019s study of fossil Arctic flora led him to postulate that the Arctic had served as the\ncentre of new generations of plants which then radiated south to America, Europe, and\nAsia.\"\n\u201cThese migrations of new plant species and groups, which originated in the Arctic\nand then became closely related \u2018vicarious\u2019 species through simultaneous differentia-\ntion, elegantly account for the mysterious similarity of tree and shrub vegetation in\nsuch scattered locations as eastern Asia and Atlantic North America. This theory also\nexplained the resemblance noted by Heer of the Tertiary flora of Europe and the Re-\ncent flora of eastern Asia and Atlantic North America.\u201d'?\nAs Johnson noted, while Heer\u2019s theory dates to the late 19th century, his \u201cnotion of an\nArctic evolutionary cradle is startlingly modern, in line with the work of Dawson and\nHickey\u201d'\u00ae to which we shall come anon.\nE. C. Pielou, on the other hand, reminded her readers of photoperiodism which presents\nan \u201capparent obstacle to long, northward and southward migration of plants\u201d since such\nin \u201capparent obstacle to long, northward and southward migration of plants\u201d since such\nmigrations would have moved said plants out of their physiological niche.\"* Long-day\nplants, for instance, cannot survive in the tropics, while short-day plants cannot thrive in\nmore northern latitudes. This is because the photoperiodic length varies from latitude to lati-\ntude and from season to season. Because day and night lengths in the tropics approximate\ntwelve hours each all year round, photoperiodic variations are small to non-existent. In the\nmid-temperate regions, photoperiodic spans can vary from up to nine hours in December to\nup to sixteen hours in June. In the present Arctic regions, photoperiodicity drops to zero in\nDecember, rising as high as twenty-four hours in June.\nAll this, however, would have been of very little, if any, importance during the Tertiary if\nEarth had basked under a continuous and universal sub-tropical climate and light regime as\nseems to be indicated by the evidence presented above. In the case at hand, the climatic\nrequirements would have been close to identical the world over. Migrating plants would not\nhave had to vacate any physiological niches; they would merely have radiated into new areas\nthe climatic properties of which would have been near identical to the ones of their origin.\nIn the end, it is the available evidence that counts. Does the evidence support the theory\nof a Tertiary plant migration from the Arctic into more southerly latitudes? We have seen\nabove that Johnson claimed that Heer\u2019s nineteenth century theory of just such a migration is\nin line with the modern work of Dawson and Hickey. What have these two authorities to\nshow us?",
