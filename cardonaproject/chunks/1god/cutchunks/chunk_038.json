    "content": "\nmotionless lord, we again see that this stability had nothing to do with slowness of move-\nment. What is being described here is an immobile god, a planet bereft of motion.\nTHE EGYPTIAN EXPLICITNESS\nWhen we come to Egypt, there is no longer any ambiguity concerning the Saturnian char-\nacteristic we have been investigating. In a hymn to Ra, the deity is addressed with these\nwords: \u201cO thou firstborn, who dost lie without movement...\u201d Here, once again, it remains\nfor Egyptologists to explain why, if Ra was truly the Sun, it was described as lying \u201cwithout\nmovement.\u201d Ra, it was said, \u201crests on his high place.\u201d\u2122\nAtum was also said to have been immobile. Called \u201cthe Firm Heart of the Sky,\u201d it was\ndistinctly said of him that \u201cthe Great God lives fixed in the middle of the sky.\u201d\nIn the Papyrus of Ani, the deceased is addressed with these words: \u201cO thou who art with-\nout motion like unto Osiris!\u201d\u2014and this phrase is twice repeated.\u201d The immobility of Osiris\nis also mentioned in the Text of Teta: \u201cThou art stable in thy name of \u2018Menu\u2019,\u201d it is there\nstated, where \u201cMenu\u201d itself has the meaning of \u201cStable One,\u201d\u201d the very same epithet we\nhave found attached to other Saturnian deities.\nThe Egyptian god Ptah, whom we have also seen being identified as a personification of\nSaturn, was also syncretized with Tenen or Tatanen, a primeval deity who was also lauded as\nthe Disk of Heaven,\u00ae a definite identification of the god as a celestial body. Here, Wallis\nBudge informs us that the \u201cexact attributes\u201d of this deity \u201cappear to have been unknown even\nto the Egyptians.\u201d\u201d And yet, he had no difficulty in deriving the god\u2019s name from the word\nenen, or nen, which means \u201cinertness, inactivity, rest, motionless,\u201d and the like\u201d Despite\nBudge, what this really tells us is that Tenen was considered to be without motion. If this god\ncan truly be equated with Saturn, as his assimilation with Ptah forces us to conclude, it would\nagain register the planet in question as having been immobile.\nSHINING IN THE LIGHTLAND\nThose familiar with Egyptian mythology, especially Egyptologists, can\u2014actually\nshould\u2014raise one telling objection against all of the above. And the objection is this: that,\ndespite his being lauded as lying without movement and as resting on his high place, there\nare various tracts which describe Ra as rising and setting. For instance, in a hymn to Ra, the\ngod is lauded with the words:\n\u201cHomage to thee, O thou who art Ra when thou risesth and Temu [that is Atum]\nwhen thou settest. Thou risest, thou risest, thou shinest, thou shinest, thou who are\ncrowned king of the gods. ..the company of the gods rejoice when thou risest...\u201d!",

Homage to\nthee...when thou risest on the horizon and sheddest thy beams of light...Homage to\nthee, O thou who risest in the horizon as Ra...\u201d!\u201d\n\nHow, then, can we reconcile the above passages, and many more like them, with the idea\nof a motionless Ra?\n\nWell, in the first place, the word translated as \u201chorizon\u201d \u20143ht\u2014actually means \u201clight-\nland,\u201d'\u00ae and while this term continues to be accepted as meaning \u201chorizon,\u201d it should never\nhave been.\n\nIn the second place, the word translated as \u201crises\u201d actually means \u201cshines,\u201d as Patricia\nSpencer indicated.\" There are various Egyptian words which carry these ambiguous mean-\nings. Nen, for instance, means \u201cto rise,\u201d often used in relation to a celestial body, but it also\nmeans \u201cto shine.\u201d'\u00ae More than that, as we have just seen, nen also carries the meanings \u201cin-\nertness, inactivity, rest,\u201d and \u201cmotionless.\u201d Khaut signifies the \u201crising of a god,\u201d but also\n\u201cappearance, splendor, radiance, or brilliance of a god.\u201d\"\u00ae Skhai means \u201cto make to rise up,\u201d\nbut also \u201cto appear.\u201d \u201d When it comes to the rising of the very Ra in question, one word that\nis often used is kha or khai, meaning \u201cto rise\u201d or \u201cto ascend,\u201d but also \u201cto shine\u201d or \u201cto ap-\npear.\u201d 1B So, similarly, with such words as pert (to come forth),'\u00b0uben (to grow bright), and\nun.\n\nAs for \u201csetting,\u201d there is an Egyptian word\u2014urt\u2014which has been rendered as meaning\njust that, but it is only used for \u201cthe setting of a star.\u201d\"' On the other hand, a related\nword\u2014urt-t\u2014actually means \u201cimmobility,\u201d while Urt refers to \u201ca motionless god.\u201d'?\n\nEgyptologists who have translated such phrases as \u201cO thou who risest in the horizon as\nRa\u201d did so because the words \u201cO thou who shines in the lightland\u201d made little sense. On the\nother hand, and in face of the fact that Ra is often described as having been motionless, trans-\nlators should have kept these additional meanings in mind. A motionless god, or celestial\nbody, that rises and sets is an impossibility. A god, or celestial body, that shines without\nmovement is not. Thus, As David Talbott indicated, the god does not rise or set but comes\nforth and recedes, that is he grows bright, he shines, and he dims.'\u201d\n\nREIGNING EM HETEP\n\nWe have already seen it said of Atum that he \u201clives fixed in the middle of the sky.\u201d\n\nInter alia, the god was also said to have reigned in peace. \u201cHomage to thee, O thou who\nart in peace,\u201d is a phrase twice repeated in the Papyrus of Mut-hetep. \u201cCome, come in\npeace!\u201d he is implored, \u201cthou wakest in peace...\u201d!*",

    "content": "We suggested above that the Semitic word for \u201cpeace\u201d \u2014 shalom, salam, sliema\u2014derived\nfrom the name of the Saturnian deity called Shulman, Shulmanu, and/or Shalem. We have\nalso seen that the name of this god translates as \u201cthe Stable One.\u201d But what, then, is the con-\nnection between peace and stability?\n\nThe Hebrew shalom derives from shalam, which means \u201cto be safe.\u201d \"> So, also, with the\nMaltese sliema which also means \u201csafety.\u201d\"\u00b0 \u201cPeace\u201d and \u201csafety\u201d are allied terms but, in a\nsense, is not also \u201cstability\u201d?\n\nNow, as it happens, the Egyptian word sharm\u2019 means \u201cto be peaceful,\u201d but also \u201cto be\nidle\u201d\"\u201d\u2014that is \u201cto be doing nothing,\u201d which negates motion. Another Egyptian word\nmeaning \u201cto be at peace\u201d is heri, but heri also means \u201cto rest.\u201d\"\u00ae The Egyptian word most\ncommonly used for \u201cto be at peace,\u201d however, is hetep which also means \u201cto repose,\u201d \u201cto\nrest,\u201d and \u201cto be at rest.\u201d\"\n\nThis, then, raises the question: Given that Atum was described as being fixed in the mid-\ndle of the sky, what is the logical characteristic to be allotted him when he is stated to have\nbeen em hetep \u2014to have been at peace, or to have been at rest?\n\nThis, incidentally, brings us back to the god Imhotep\u2014the same as Em Hetep\u2014and\nmakes us ask the question: Was Imhotep really the deified architect who built Djoser\u2019s pyra-\nmid, as generally believed? Or was he yet another manifestation of the immobile god we\nhave learned to recognize as Saturn? Talbott, who embraced the meaning of this god\u2019s name\nas \u201cthe one who comes forth while standing in one place,\u201d \u2122 seems to have had no doubt.\n\nIMMOVABLY FIXED\n\nThe Egyptian Ra is not the only supposed sun-god said to have been devoid of mo-\ntion. In chapter 3 we saw the Indic Surya called Suraj, which latter name belongs to the\nplanet Saturn. We also noted there that Surya is said to have occupied samanam dhama, \u201cthe\nsame place of rising and setting.\u201d We did not there explain the meaning behind this term,\nhaving used it only to denote that Surya could not possibly have been the present Sun. What\nis easier to believe, that a celestial body can climb vertically up the sky and vertically down\non the same path, or that it brightens and fades while remaining in the same spot? In view of\nwhat we have now disclosed, does not the latter seem preferable? In fact, we can state it un-\nequivocally, since it is unambiguously written that Surya \u201cstands firmly,\u201d and he does so on a\n\u201csafe resting place.\u201d The belief in Surya\u2019s immobility was so ingrained that he continued to\nbe remembered as \u201cthe immovable center of his system.\u201d \u201d So how can Indologists continue\nto perpetrate the disinformation that Surya is the Sun?\n\nEven Brahma, we are told, does not rise and set. He \u201cremains alone in the center.\u201d'\u201d And\nif there are those who think that this immobility may have applied to planetary deities, but\nnot necessarily to the planets they once personified, they are mistaken. Sthirah, for instance,\nis yet one more Sanskrit name for the planet Saturn.'\u201d No deity is involved here. And yet we",

It is a pure astronomical\nassertion deduced from the very meaning of the planet\u2019s name.\nTHE NEVER-SETTING PLANET\nLynn Rose deduced that the bizarre astronomical system of Philolaos, the Pythagorean\nphilosopher from Souther Italy, was merely a \u201cgarbled\u201d version of the primeval Saturnian\nsystem. This, needless to say, led him to the conclusion that the Central Fire of which\nPhilolaos spoke was really an allusion to the old Saturnian sun. As Rose then tells us:\n\u201cHistorians of philosophy are fond of referring to the \u2018dark sayings\u2019 of Heraclitus. If\nHeraclitus was at times reflecting back to conditions during the Age of Kronos, per-\nhaps we are now in a position to understand some of his mysterious remarks. The\nCentral Fire is always at the same location in the sky (as viewed from one spot); this\nmay be why Heraclitus asks, \u2018How can anyone hide from that which never sets?\u201d\u201d!\u201d\nAs Rose continues:\n\u201cEven some of the Philolaos fragments, although their authenticity has been ques-\ntioned, make more sense now We are also told that \u2018it [the Central Fire] is ruler and\nteacher of all things; it is God, One ever-existing, stable, unmoving, itself like to it-\nself, different from the rest,\u2019 and that it \u2018remains One for ever in the same position\nand condition\u2019.\u201d\"\nand condition\u2019.\u201d'*\nGreek knowledge of the immobile Saturnian sun, however, was not restricted to the\n\u201cgarbled\u201d version of Philolaos. In his evaluation of the Greek Helios and other so-called an-\ncient sun-gods, E. A. Butterworth also came to the conclusion that this luminary \u201cis not the\nnatural sun of heaven, for it neither rises nor sets, but is, as it seems, ever at the zenith...\u201d'\u201d\nSo similarly from other parts of the world. For example, in Roman tradition, among the\npoets, Saturn was remembered as the god of \u201cthe steadfast star.\u201d 30\nThe Incas, too, preserved a memory of a sun-god\u2014a resting one, to be sure\u2014who was\nable \u201cto light the world from one spot.\u201d'' We can therefore be assured that when the\nMakiritare of the Upper Orinoco River, in Venezuela, tell us that their god Wanadi was \u201clike\na sun that never sets,\u201d'\u201d they are referring to an old tradition about the planet Saturn. That\nWanadi was not the present Sun is additionally indicated by the fact that the Makiritare name\nfor the Sun is Shi.",
