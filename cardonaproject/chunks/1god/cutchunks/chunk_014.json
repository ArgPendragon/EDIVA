Developed in the fourteenth century B.C., the calen-\ndar passed on to the Olmec of the Gulf Coast and, from there, to the Maya in the east and the\nplateau of Mexico in the west.\u00ae Whether Malmstrom has come across a red herring, and/or\nwhether Mayanists will ever accept his conclusions, as of this writing remains to be seen.\nOne thing that can be stated for certain is that the synchronization of this calendar with the\n360-day one occurred once every 18,980 days, which makes for 52 years.\u00ae This is the same\ntime period we have already encountered as separating the ceremony known as the Binding\nof the Years which began at the midnight transit of the Pleiades constellation.\n\nThe Mesoamericans also devised a lunar calendar which fitted into their other time-\nkeeping devices. The lunar r period of 29.53 days that they obtained contained a mere discrep-\nancy of only .112 of a day.\n\nThe Dresden Codex not only includes the perpetual lunar calendar mentioned above, but\nalso a table of new moons to be used for the prediction of solar eclipses.\u201d\n\nVENUS\n\nOf all the celestial bodies that the Mesoamericans observed, the planet Venus seems\nwithout doubt to have been considered the most important. Called, among other things, the\nGreat, or Ancient, Star, it is repeatedly alluded to in the extant codices. Ram\u00e9n y Zamora,\nwho studied the lore of the Mexican tribes only a few decades after the re-discovery of\nAmerica, was astounded to discover that the Indians kept a precise record of the appearances\nof this planet. \u201cSo accurately did they keep the record of the days when it appeared and dis-\nappeared,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat they never made a mistake.\u201d\u201d Toribo Motolina added that \u201cthey\nknew on what day it would appear again in the east after it had lost itself or disappeared in\nthe west\u201d and that \u201cthey counted the days by this star and yielded reverence and offered sac-\nrifices to it.\u201d\u201d\n\nThe Dresden Codex of the Maya includes a complete record of the apparition of this\nplanet in its cycle from Moming to Evening Star, recorded in the dot and bar mathematical\nsymbols which they employed (in which a dot signifies 1, and a bar stands for 5, with an\noval\u2014a stylized seashell, really\u2014for the concept of zero). Intervals indicating the elapsed\ntime between successive heliacal risings are there recorded. This interval of time was calcu-\nlated by them as a period of 584 days which the Maya subdivided into four subintervals: the\nappearance of the planet as Morning Star; its appearance as Evening Star; its disappearance\nin front of the Sun; and its disappearance behind the Sun.\u2122\n\nVenus takes 224.7 days to complete one circuit around the Sun. As seen from Earth,\nhowever, it appears to take 583.92 days to complete one circuit. This is because Earth, too, is\nmoving in the same direction. This apparent time-span is known as the synodic period. As\nnoted above, the Mesoamericans calculated the Venerian synodic year as 584 days,\u201d which,\nwhen compared to the modern value of 583.92 days, discloses an error of less than one hour",

Indeed, Floyd Lounsbury has argued that the Venus table \u201cwas historically set in\nmotion\u201d on a date which translates as November 20 in A.D. 934.\"\nThere has also been some scholarly speculation that the codices also contain information\nconcerning the other planets visible to the naked eye,\u2122 but, as of this writing, this has not yet\nbeen verified. On the other hand, we will never know just how much lore has been lost due to\nthe burning of so many other codices by the Spanish Catholic Church, concerning which Di-\nego de Landa, the first archbishop of Yucatan, boasted so much.\nSUN SPOTS\nThe ancient Chinese were aware that the Sun exhibits spots on its surface.

It is easily forgotten by the\nlayman that one cannot easily view the Sun directly without some form of optic protection\nexcept during its risings and settings. Of course, it could also be argued that the Chinese, who\nwere so adept at just about everything, could have utilized dark, or smoked, glass in order to\nenable them to view sunspots. Actually, not even a smoked glass would have been necessary.\nDespite the fact that the Sun cannot be viewed directly for any length of time with the un-\naided eye, it can be viewed indirectly when it is shielded by haze or thin clouds. As John\nGribbin noted, it is hardly surprising that those Chinese records which mention sunspots\n\u201cvery often comment at the same time that the brightness of the Sun was reduced.\u201d As\nGribbin explained: \u201cThis does not imply that the Sun itself was dim, but that dust or haze in\nthe atmosphere was obscuring its light and making it possible to pick out the spots against the\nglare of the solar disk.\u201d\u00ae Had sunspots been as easily detected with the unaided eye as some\nwould think, it would not, in Europe, have taken till the early seventeenth century for them to\nbe re-discovered. One of the reasons why Galileo was persecuted by the Catholic Church was\nhis insistence that the Sun often exhibits such blemishes on its surface. Prior to that, one of\nthe central dogmas of the Church was that the Sun, having been created by God, had to be a\nperfect sphere. \u201c[S]uggesting imperfection in the Sun was seen in some quarters as implying\nthat God could be fallible and was guilty of shoddy workmanship.\u201d\u201d\u201d And yet, even before\nthe Chinese, sunspots had long been known to the ancient Greeks.\nTHE ETERNAL PLANET\nThe caliber of ancient Chinese astronomy can inter alia be judged by what the imperial\nastronomers were able to discover about the planets. Here I do not wish to bore the lay reader\nwith too many technicalities, so I will merely zero in on what the Chinese had to say con-\ncerning the planet Saturn, the astronomical name of which was T\u2019ien-Sing, which means\n\u201cEternal Planet.\u201d The slowness of this body in its course around the Sun, for instance, was\ndescribed by them in this manner:\n\u201cThis planet, with its slow and heavy walk, imitating age, drags itself along its path,\nin a manner of speaking; before finishing its revolution, it had seen a great number of\nmen die whom it had seen being born, so slow was its pace.\u201d\u00ae",
