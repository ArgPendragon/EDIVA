No other deity existed with him or before him.\nPRAJAPATI\nWe have already seen the Indic Brahma, known as the \u201cfather of gods and men,\u201d identi-\nfied as Saturn through the name Brahmanyah. In that respect, it is noteworthy that Brahma is\nconsidered to have been the first of the Devas, which term is understood as meaning\n\u201cdeities,\u201d but which, in effect, means the \u201cshining ones,\u201d\u201d an apt term for heavenly bodies. It\nis therefore telling that Brahma, too, was described as having originally been alone: \u201cHe hov-\ners, alone, above everything.\u201d\u2122\nAn epithet, usually translated to mean \u201cLord of Creatures,\u201d\u201d by which Brahma was\nknown is Prajapati.\u201d This is so true that, in the Vishnu Purana, Prajapati is given as an addi-\ntional name for Brahma.\u201d Like others of the Saturnian deities we have been examining,\nPrajapati was also referred to as \u201cthe One God.\u201d\u201d\nPrajapati\u2019s identity as Saturn does not solely rely on that of Brahma. As the 11th century\nA.D. Arabian scholar, Al-Biruni, discovered during his travels in India, the Lord of Saturn is\ncalled Prajapati\u2014pure and simple.*\nIt should therefore not surprise us that, in distinction to Brahma, who was actually his\nown self, Prajapati was believed to have originally ruled alone. This we find in the Satapatha\nBrahmana which, among other matters, states that \u201cPrajapati alone, indeed, existed here in\nthe beginning.\u201d\u2122\nFOUR FROM THE \u201cPRIMITIVE\u201d WORLD\nThe doctrinal conviction we have been investigating is to be found not only among the\ngreat faiths of the ancient world, but also among more primitive peoples.\nAmong the American Indians of the north-west, the creator was known as Raven. But\nhere we have to differentiate between two Ravens. Most tales concerning Raven present this\nmysterious being as a shape-shifter and trickster who was often meddling with what had been\ncreated, even though he himself was also responsible for creating certain elements. As a\nmeddler, shape-shifter, and trickster, Raven is identifiable as a personification of the planet",

But as the prime creator of the cosmos,\u201d Raven has to be identified as the planet Sat-\num.\nNow it is true that most myths do not differentiate between the two but, at least among\nthe Eskimos and the Tlingit, the difference between them is remembered and indicated by the\nappearance of Raven Boy in addition to Raven.\u201d Presented as the son of Raven,\u201d it is Raven\nBoy who is there painted as the mischievous trickster.*\nIn keeping with our present topic, note now the Haida creed as paraphrased by Helmut\nHirnschall:\n\u201cNo one is exempt from loneliness, and the old and wise ones who teach the ways of\nliving and tell stories at campfires say that even Raven, the Creator, knew the burden\nof loneliness.\u201d\nIn order to have known \u201cthe burden of loneliness,\u201d Raven had to have been alone\u2014that is\nthe only deity in existence.

Those who hold to this\nby David Rohl in his sensational attempt to rewrite ancient history.\u2019 Those who hold to this\nview usually point with pride to the Mesopotamian Gilgamesh, a supposed king of Uruk, and\nthe Egyptian Imhotep, architect to King Djoser, as prime examples of their evidence. But that\nGilgamesh was anything but a historical person has finally been established beyond a reason-\nable doubt, once and for all, by Ev Cochrane,\u201d while the case of Imhotep is somewhat\nunique. The first builder of a pyramid\u2014a stepped one to be sure\u2014later dynasts were so im-\npressed by Imhotep\u2019s accomplishments that he was elevated to the stature of a god. This is\nnot to be wondered at because, after all, the Egyptian pharaohs themselves were all looked\nupon as living gods. We do not, however, encounter Imhotep in any mythological themes, let\nalone any of a cosmogonic nature. For whatever it is worth, and Rohl notwithstanding, the\nbelief that the ancient gods were really deified historical persons, never adhered to by many,\nis now accepted by even less. On the contrary, the reverse is true, in that some of the\nprimeval deities were eventually demythologized and presented in human garb even by the\nancients themselves.\u201d\nOur own hypothesis, as presented in this work, holds to the view that the concept of deity\nowes its origin to the planets, especially the planet Saturn, and not to such invented spirits,\nghosts, demons, or historical persons as described above. I am not here asserting that the\nmysteries of everyday life, as they pertained to our primitive forebears, were not conducive\nof the myth-making process. But to say that our ancestors were more concerned with the\nthreatening character of everyday life, such as flood, famine, earthquakes, and the like, is to\ngo against what they themselves told us concerning their beliefs. If the truth need be known,\neven such calamities as enumerated above were often connected with the planetary deities,\nand they were so connected by the ancients themselves. Thus, to give but a few examples:\nAmong the Incas, Saturn was considered the god of famine.\u00ae* Almost throughout the entire\nworld, Mars was considered the god of pestilence.\u201d Venus was associated with fear, dark-\nness and death.\u201d The Babylonians, moreover, never discarded their belief that even earth-\nquakes were actually caused by the planets.*\nquakes were actually caused by the planets.  st\nAdherents of the animistic theory, however, base their concepts of the origin of religion\non the beliefs of present primitive peoples, rather than the civilized nations of the ancient\nworld. But even there, their theory meets with various objections. Consider, for instance, the\nEfe pygmies of the Ituri forest whom we had occasion to mention in a previous chapter.\nThese pygmies do not cower in fear of thunder and lightning. Their lives are not ruled, or ter-\nrorized, by a squadron of jungle spirits that have to be appeased every time a calamity hits",
