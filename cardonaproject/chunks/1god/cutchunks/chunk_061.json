This evidence comes from tree rings. As every Boy Scout knows, tree\ntrunks are marked out in transverse section into concentric rings, one ring for each \u201cseason\u201d\nof growth. In order to tell the age of a felled tree, Boy Scouts are taught to count the number\nof rings laid out in its trunk. Known as annular rings, these growth marks owe their emer-\ngence to differences in the elements at the beginning and end of each growing period.\nFossilized trees from various past ages show distinct annular rings. Others do not. Wood\nretrieved from late Paleozoic deposits in the southern hemisphere has been said to show\npronounced ring growths. So, also, fossils of deciduous trees from the Cretaceous. In fact,\nfossilized wood samples ranging all the way from the Devonian to the Eocene have been\nclaimed to show well marked annular rings. The scientific literature on this subject, however,\nis very ambiguous. More recent work has tended to show that rings are either lacking or very\nweak in all known specimens from the Devonian period which seems to indicate a non-sea-\nsonal environment. Most fossil trees from the Carboniferous period, which followed the De-\nvonian, also lack rings. As Elso Barghoorn noted:\n\u201cOne impressive indicator of uniform climate over great areas of the Carboniferous\ncontinents is the great absence of annual growth rings in coal-swamp trees. The entire\nquestion of ring development in woody plants is one fraught with botanical variables\nas well as climatic variables. However, the consistent absence of any index of sea-\nsonal growth seems difficult to explain except on the assumption that winter cold and\nseasonality of rainfall were absent or at a minimum.\u201d\nBy the time we come to the late Permian period, still within the Paleozoic era, we end up\nwith a mixed bag. Fossil woods from Canada, Europe, and Asia have weak or non-existent\nrings, while those from South America, Africa, and Antarctica show prominent and wide\ngrowth rings. A mixed bag from trees growing in different areas may be expected. But what\nabout a similar mixed bag from trees known to have grown in the same locality? Thus, mov-\ning slightly closer to our time, we come to the Triassic period of the Mesozoic era. Few fossil",

One specimen from this collection lacks annular markings, but others display very\nwide prominent rings. In samples from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods of the same\nMesozoic era, as well as from the Early Tertiary period, tree rings range from prominent to\nnon-existent, depending on the paleolatitude in which they are claimed to have thrived.\nWhen it comes to polar fossil plants, as Edward Berry noted: \u201cDetailed comparisons of\nthese Arctic floras with contemporary floras from lower latitudes...show unmistakable\nevidence for the existence of climatic zones...\u201d C. P. Brooks reached the same opinion,\nclaiming that climatic zones existed in the Eocene,\u201d as so did Ralph Chaney, who pushed the\nmargin up to the Pliocene.\u201d As Jane Francis noted, samples of wood collected by her on\nAxel Heiberg Island showed clear annular rings over a quarter of an inch wide. And, because\nthe darker latewood added at the end of the growing season featured very narrow bands, the\nconclusion has been drawn that the trees grew rapidly during the twenty-four hour sunshine\nperiod of the Arctic summer and then closed up shop during the winter hours of darkness.\u201d\nThe problem with this, however, is that trees would not have survived such prolonged\nperiods of darkness. And then there is the fauna to consider. What\u2014did tapirs and crocodiles\nsleep through these darkened months? Could land tortoises have migrated to warmer climes?\nBesides, where did the warmth that would have been needed to thaw the Arctic ice cap come\nfrom? The present Sun is not capable of accomplishing that feat. And if the Sun, as accepted\nby orthodoxy, had been dimmer in those eras, it would have been able to accomplish it even\nless. Or are we to believe that sub-tropical flora and fauna existed in an ice-bound region, and\nfor millions of years at that? But how, then, do we get out of this dilemma?

All of which forces us to ask yet another ques-\ntion: Are annular rings really indicative of seasonality?\nActually, annular rings are only formed in those plants whose growth is interrupted by a\nregular winter or dry \u201cseason.\u201d The increment of new wood formed in these trees is marked\nby a distinct line which is produced by the contrast between the late summer of one year and\nthe spring of the next. The lines of separation between successive rings marks the limit of a\nmicroscopically thin layer of cells, known as the cambium, which lies between the wood and\nthe bark, at the end of each successive growth period. The bark then cracks and/or expands to\nallow for the new growth of wood, and the tree trunk is thus thickened. It should be noted,\nhowever, that the cambium responds mainly to conditions of temperature and rainfall rather\nthan the incidence of light.\nIn temperate climates, the cambium produces new wood only during spring and early\nsummer. It becomes inactive during autumn and winter. But what about trees growing in\ntropical and equatorial regions where seasonal differences disappear? Do they still grow\nrings? As it happens, many kinds of evergreen tropical trees do not grow rings.\u2122 But others\ndo. As Barghoorn reported: \u201cIn existing woody plants, annual ring development may occur\nunder nearly uniform climatic conditions, as in equatorial rainforests.\u201d\u00b0* What, then, is it in\nthis seasonless environment that tells these trees that a year has passed and that it is time to\ngrow more wood and thus form a new ring?\nThat the growth of annular rings is not tied to seasonal change is evidenced by the fact\nthat some trees have been known to grow as much as three or four rings in one year. Nor is\nthis an uncommon situation, as Nelson Glueck noted, especially in trees which grow on\nsloping ground that turns wet and dry several times in one year because of rapid outflow of\nwater.\u201d According to an item in Nature magazine, multiple rings in larch trees were normal\nin 1919; in fact, larches seem to be prone to multiple ring growth.\u201d\nMeanwhile, trees which miss growing a ring in certain years have also been known.\u201d As\nHerbert Sorensen pointed out:\n\u201cIn dry and climatically harsh years, no detectable growth may occur. In this case no\nring is formed and the ring is missing for that season of the year.\u201d\u201d",

In fact,\nlet us be honest about it, they are not indicative of seasonal change at all. But if tree rings do\nnot indicate seasonal change, what, then, do they indicate?\n\nWe have already noted above that the cambium responsible for the growth of trees re-\nsponds mainly to conditions of temperature and rainfall rather than the incidence of light.\nAnd, in fact, when it comes to the growth rate of trees, water is the limiting factor. In other\nwords, water is the one true constituent which limits the growth of cambium and thus the\nformation of growth rings. This is what tree rings, when they grow at all, truly indicate\u2014a\ncycle dictated by the availability and cessation of an adequate water supply \u2014which is pro-\nbably what Ian Johnson meant by \u201cordinary seasonal growth cycle\u201d as opposed to \u201ca polar\nseasonality.\u201d Only in the most indirect way can tree rings be said to indicate seasonal change\nwhen they do so at all.\n\nThat being the case, the lower incidence of light from the Saturnian sun, as compared to\nthe higher incidence from our present Sun, would have posed no obstacle to the growth of\ntrees. Temperature would also have posed no problem because, while the Saturnian sun\nwould not have been as hot as our present Sun, its proximity to Earth would have compen-\nsated for its lower caloric output.\n\nAs we have seen, it is quite apparent that trees grow rings, or fail to grow rings,\nregardless of seasonal change or stability. More importantly, if trees can, as they do, grow\nrings in tropical and equatorial regions in which there is no appreciable seasonal change,\nwhat is so problematic with having trees growing rings in a sub-tropical Arctic which\nenjoyed but one spring-like season?\n\nPaleobotanists remain hard-put to account for the growth of sub-tropical forests and the\nexistence of sub-tropical animals within the Arctic Circle. Uniform heat and light, to say\nnothing of the absence of an ice cover, would have been required for the flourishing of such\nforests and the thriving of such animals.\n\nTHE AXIAL TILT HYPOTHESIS\n\nWhy not simply straighten Earth\u2019s axis?\n\nThis, too, would have ensured a world with one season, an eternal spring. And as difficult\nas it might be to later tilt Earth\u2019s axis to the angle it now holds, it seems more feasible than\nany of the hypotheses we have so far proposed. This, in fact, had been suggested by various\nauthorities at the end of the nineteenth century as, for instance, by Julius Hann: \u201cThe simplest\nand most obvious explanation of great secular changes in climate, and of former prevalence\nof higher temperatures in northern circumpolar regions, would be found in the assumption\nthat the earth\u2019s axis of rotation has not always had the same position, but that it may have",
