    "content": "\n\u201cThe filaments look like textbook examples of electromagnetic vortices, consisting of\nan outer layer of spiraling helices surrounding an inner layer of nearly straight\nthreads. What\u2019s more, indirect measurements suggest that the strength of the mag-\nnetic field in the filaments is far greater than what most astrophysicists thought\npossible on such a scale \u2014 but just about what Peratt\u2019s simulations predicted.\u201d%8\nThis then raises the question as to where the original filaments that form galaxies come\nfrom. Arp talks of \u201cnewly created matter\u201d as a matter of fact as so, also, do most astro-\nphysicists. He, however, clarifies this by stating that \u201cit would not strictly be new creation\nbut merely materialization of mass-energy from a different, perhaps diffuse location.\u201d 1\u00b0\n\u201cOf course if the universe is operationally defined as everything that is detectable or\npotentially detectable there can be no such thing as \u2018new\u2019 matter. So when we speak\nof creation of matter we do not mean matter coming into our universe from some-\nwhere else (there is nowhere else) or from nothing. We must mean the transformation\nof previously existing mass-energy. Probably this means materialization from a pre-\nviously diffused state...\u201d 101\nGranted, Arp does not speak of plasma, but his \u201cpreviously diffused state\u201d can be under-\nstood as just that. In fact, if we are to believe Alfv\u00e9n, plasma simply exists and, as we have\nseen, the entire Universe is actually composed of 99% of it. As Lerner paraphrased Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s\nargument:\n\u201cTn any plasma...tiny vortex filaments form spontaneously, and over time they grow\nlarger and larger. Given enough time...there\u2019s no reason why cosmic filaments\ncouldn\u2019t have grown to a length of billions of light-years. Gathering matter around\nthem, the filaments could have organized the universe into a complex web of mag-\nnetic fields, electric currents, and plasma\u2014a kind of cosmic power grid.\u201d 1\nOnce these filaments organize themselves into super-cluster complexes, they will have\nacquired so much mass that they will continue to be shaped by gravity as well as electric and\nmagnetic fields. Gravity itself would break the filaments into \u201ccluster-size clouds of plasma,\nlike beads on a string.\u201d Eventually, while being further compressed by new filaments, the\nplasma will again be broken up and, still according to Alfv\u00e9n, would then form galaxies.\nMore than that, the sequence would continue to be repeated in steps, down to stars, planets,\nand their satellites.!3 It is for this reason that plasma is now considered to be the Funda-\nmental State of Matter. ! Or, as the renowned physicist David Bohm has been known to\nclaim: \u201cPlasmas are the origin of everything.\u201d!05\nThroughout the years, Arp has supplied a large body of observational evidence verifying\nthe concept.! Like some of the astral jets emanating from their centres, some galaxies also",

Arp believes that stars are also ejected from gal-\naxies through their spiral arms. Actually, he believes the spiral arms themselves to be ejec-\ntions which then become \u201cthe loci of new star formation.\u201d!!\u00b0 But then, in discussing pole-\nward ejections, he stresses that: \u201cThe tyranny of the observations is to insist on opposite\nejection of extragalactic material as a ubiquitous process that operates on all scales.\u201d!!! If\nthat is so, it would indicate that stars, too, could also be ejected poleward in opposite direc-\ntions along galactic plasma jets. And, in fact, Arp gives \u201ca vivid demonstration that the phe-\nnomenon of ejection of discretized bodies not only characterizes the birth of quasars and gal-\naxies...it also extends down into the realm of young star formation.\u201d !!? He does this by refer-\nring the reader to the photographs of HH 34, which we have already encountered in a previ-\nous chapter as a Herbig-Haro object displaying distinct knots in its jet. He then goes on to say\nthat \u201cthere is an uncanny resemblance between the formation of young galaxies and the for-\nmation of young stars.\u201d!!3 And, to be sure, the belief that Herbig-Haro objects actually give\nbirth to stars is now being preached as a matter of fact.!!4\nIf galaxies eject galaxies, and galaxies eject stars, all along their plasma jets in opposite\ndirections in direct line with their axis of rotation, can stars eject dwarf stars through the\nsame process? As we have seen, mainstream astrophysicists are now convinced that brown\ndwarfs can be ejected from star forming regions if not from stars themselves. As Reipurth\nphrased it, \u201cthe smallest [stellar] embryos will often be completely ejected from the star-\nforming region, destined to spend eternity alone as brown dwarfs.\u201d But also \u201csome brown\ndwarfs may be kicked out of the star-forming cores.\u201d 115\nSpeaking of the \u201cknots\u201d seen in the jet emitted by HH 34, Thornhill offered the follow-\ning:\n\u201cIn my humble opinion, HH 34 is spitting out objects which might become individual\nbrown dwarfs...\u201d 16\nBut if Arp is correct in that the ejection of cosmic bodies takes place at all scales, why\nshould the next step down not be the ejection of planets from brown dwarfs?\nThornhill, however, included gas giant planets with these brown dwarfs\u2014and more. As\nhe explained, \u201cbrown dwarfs in the plasma environment of a brighter star become gas giants,\nspitting out rocky planets and moons from their interiors in an attempt to alleviate electrical\nstresses.\u201d When it comes to the direction in which these bodies are ejected, Thornhill then\noffered the following: \u201cWhether the spitting occurs in the polar or equatorial direction de-",

In the case of HH objects, they are generally more active than our\nSun, that is, more electrically stressed.\u201d !73\nArp himself does not treat of dwarf stars, brown or red. As we have seen, however, ob-\nservations have led him to believe that poleward ejection is a process that operates on all\nscales. So why not brown dwarf stars?\nTrue, no jets from brown dwarfs have so far been detected. Because of their low mass\nand feeble optical radiation, however, brown dwarf stars themselves are very difficult objects\nto detect. The detection of any existing jets emanating from them would be all that more dif-\nficult. Even so, there are other emissions from brown dwarfs to be considered. Thus, even as\nthe writing of this book is nearing the end, astronomical discoveries continue to accumulate\nin favor of its thesis. To begin with, on December 15, 1999, Bob Rutledge and his colleagues\nnoted an X-ray flare emanating from the brown dwarf star designated LP 944-20, located in\nthe constellation Fornax, estimated at 16 light-years from Earth. \u201cIt seemed fantastically\nbright and hard to believe,\u201d said Gibor Basri who then hailed from the University of Califor-\nnia at Berkeley. The flare appeared \u201cbriefly as an intense flash before fading out over the\nfollowing two hours.\u201d !74\nLess than a year later, a group of graduate students on a National Science Foundation\nsummer program, working at the Very Large Array near Socorro, New Mexico, detected\nstrong radio waves emanating from the same brown dwarf star. These emissions \u201cspiked up\nto 10,000 times stronger than what astronomers thought possible, indicating an intense flare\nof energy that may be similar to flares on the Sun,\u201d researchers said. The dwarf was found to\nemit these radio waves constantly \u201cwith intermittent flares that last for hours.\u201d As Shri Kul-\nkarni stated: \u201cMany astronomers are surprised at this discovery, because they didn\u2019t expect\nsuch strong radio emissions from this object.\u201d!25 Or, as Eduardo Martin, from the University\nof Hawaii, phrased it:\n\u201cIt is not surprising that LP 944-20 has flares, but it is surprising that they are so\nbright in the radio [wavelengths]. The result is significant in telling us that brown\ndwarfs break the rules of stellar astronomy.\u201d !26\nCall me naive when it comes to plasma physics, but do not these two items tend to throw\na certain amount of doubt re Thornhill\u2019s claim that brown dwarf stars are too electrically low\nstressed to enable them to emit jets. Besides, as Arp discovered in a certain galaxy that he has\nstudied, the radio jet, the X-ray jet, and the optical jet \u201care all coincident and define a precise\nejection axis.\u201d !27 Radio and X-ray emissions thus seem to go hand in hand with optical jets.\nSo if brown dwarfs emit both radio and X-ray emissions, the likelihood of their emitting op-\ntical jets does not seem that far fetched.\nAdditionally, and more importantly, there are the so-called accretion, or circumstellar,\ndisks to consider. As we have seen, the birth-place of planets these disks could not be. Most,\nif not all, of the stars emanating plasma jets, however, are also encircled by these disks. Do\nbrown dwarfs exhibit such disks?",

More than that, circumstellar disks are be-\nlieved to be linked to these circumstellar disks. !3! More than that, circumstellar disks are be-\nlieved to be crucial in the formation of jets.!32 As one theory proclaims, it is \u201ca mixture of\nions, atoms, molecules and dust\u201d raining onto circumstellar disks along magnetic field lines\nthat accounts for the generation of jets. These magnetic field lines are then said to be \u201cpulled\nin\u201d from the perpendicular, or pinched. Centrifugal force then \u201cflings material outward along\nthe lines.\u201d Finally, the \u201cinertia of the swirling material twists the field lines into a helix,\nwhich helps to channel the outward-flowing material in a vertical direction\u201d !33\u2014which is so\ndescriptive of a Birkeland current.\nIf the above turns out to be correct, the newly discovered disks surrounding free-floating\ndwarfs should act in like manner, and one can perhaps see the day when astral jets may yet\nbe detected emanating from brown dwarf stars. And yet we have previously seen that Alfv\u00e9n\nbelieved the jets to have been generated by the induction of electric currents in the interstellar\nplasma toward the centre of galaxies \u201cwhere they turn and flow upwards along the spin axis.\u201d\nTo use Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s own terminology, this current then \u201cshort-circuits\u201d and, dumping vast\namounts of energy into the galaxy\u2019s core, ends up \u201cblowing a fuse.\u201d It is the blast from this\n\u201cfuse-blowing\u201d that propels the jets of plasmas up the spin axes of galaxies. Although Alfv\u00e9n\nwas referring to galaxies, rather than individual stars or less massive bodies, is this method of\ngeneration really that much different from the one proposed above?\nThornhill himself seems to accept both methods as being compatible. Thus, concerning\nAlfv\u00e9n\u2019s theory, he has stated that:\n\u201cOur Sun, Jupiter and Saturn, etc., all have equatorial plasmoids. It seems to be the\nnormal state for spherical magnetized anodes in a galactic discharge. Only when the\nenergy stored in those plasmoids becomes excessive will it switch to a polar jet (ac-\ncording to Alfv\u00e9n).\u201d !34\nBut then, in discussing the proposed circumstellar or placental cloud around proto-Saturn,\nhe also had this to say:\n\u201cDwardu [Cardona] mentions proto-Saturn\u2019s accretion disk. Regardless of whether\nthere was such a disk, in my opinion [it] would have nothing to do with accretion and\na whole lot to do with expulsion. Whatever its origin, it would intercept electrical en-\nergy and radiate in the infra-red. In fact it is the infra-red glow from a brown dwarf\nthat is used to infer an \u2018accretion disk\u2019 rather than direct observation.\u201d !3>",
