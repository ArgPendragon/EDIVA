Thus, for instance, where the Greeks saw a scorpion in the constellation Scor-\npio, so had the Babylonians before them. Where the Greeks saw twins in the constellation\nGemini, so had the Babylonians before them.\nPeter James has even indicated \u201csome specific linguistic borrowing\u201d in this context.\nTake, for instance, the constellation which the Greeks called Pegasus. To the Sumerians and\nAkkadians this group of stars was known as Iku, a word that meant \u201cfield.\u201d Why, then, did\nthe Greeks see a horse in this constellation had they really borrowed their lore from them?\nThis misnomer, according to James, probably stems from the fact that, in Greek, igo, which\nsounds much like iku , used to mean \u201chorse\u201d \u2014as recorded on the Linear B Tablets\u2014before\nthe word hippos was later adopted. If this is true, it would also mean that the borrowing of\nBabylonian astronomical knowledge by the Greeks \u201chad already begun in Mycenaean\ntimes,\u201d\u201d\u201d to which the Linear B Tablets belong.\nIt is known that Democritus \u201cspent some time in the East and his astronomic ideas were\ndefinitely Babylonian.\u201d '\u2122 So, also, with Hipparchus, who based much of his findings on\nBabylonian records. Here is what G. J. Toomer had to say about the subject:\n\u201cIt has always been known that Hipparchus derived material from Babylonian astron-\nomy. A considerable number of Babylonian observations are quoted in Ptolemy\u2019s Al-\nmagest (which is the principal source of our knowledge of Hipparchus\u2019 work), and\nsome of these are explicitly said to have been used by Hipparchus. But it is only in the\npresent [20th] century, with the decipherment and interpretation of the relevant cu-\nneiform texts, that his debt to Mesopotamian sources was more fully revealed.\u201d\n\u201cThus, although our information about Hipparchus\u2019 work is largely secondhand and\nfragmentary, his extensive knowledge of both the observational and theoretical parts\nof Babylonian astronomy is beyond any doubt.\u201d\"\u201d\nAs James pointed out:",

All that they recorded, he has con-\ncluded, \u201chas actually happened in the sky.\u201d As far as he was concerned, the old Babylonian\neclipse data can be used with confidence. As he wrote: \u201cComparison of modern calculations\nwith the Babylonian eclipse records gives an excellent figure for the average rate of length-\nening of the day over the past 2500 years.\u201d In fact, he went out of his way to inform his read-\ners how Babylonian astronomical records were proving useful to modern astronomers in cal-\nculating changes in the length of the day. He did, of course, discover a statistical uncertainty\nof 1.78 milliseconds per century, but, as he explained, this \u201carises not so much from inaccu-\nracies in the Babylonian measurements but more from uncertainties in the modern estimates\nof the rate of expansion of the Moon\u2019s orbit.\u201d\"\"\n\nThe Assyro-Babylonians, or Chaldeans as Diodorus Siculus called them, already knew\nthat the planetary system was a dynamic one. As Diodorus wrote: \u201cEach of the planets, ac-\ncording to them has its own particular course, and its velocities and periods of time are sub-\nject to change and variation.\u201d'\u201d They also knew that Earth was a sphere and thus counted it\namong the planets. This is evidenced by the words of Diodorus who wrote that the Chaldeans\nhad it stated \u201cthat the moon\u2019s light is reflected and her eclipses are due to the shadow of the\nearth.\u201d\n\nAmong the Babylonians, texts that deal strictly with astronomical, as opposed to astro-\nlogical, observations do not seem to have made their appearance until about the middle of the\nseventh century B.C. during the reign of Nabonassar. It is from about this time, down to the\nturn of the millennium, that we have in our possession a collection of cuneiform tablets to\nwhich Abraham Sachs has applied the term \u201castronomical diaries.\u201d\n\nThese diaries record such phenomena as the length of the lunar months, based on the\nphases of the Moon; lunar and solar eclipses; the dates of first visibility for Mars, Jupiter, and\nSaturn; the first and last visibilities of the inner planets, Venus and Mercury; the dates of the\noccurrences of the equinoxes and solstices; the dates of the significant appearances of the star\nSirius; and the \u201cconjunction\u201d of the Moon and each of the visible planets with various stars.\nMeteorological phenomena during the rainy seasons are also recorded, with diverse cloud\nand storm conditions. To all of this, one finds appended the changes in the level (rise or fall)\nof the river at Babylon, often followed \u201cby a report of secular events or rumors of such\nevents.\u201d Finally, the amount of produce (barley, dates, etc.) that could be purchased for one\nshekel of silver during any one month is also listed. The technical data\u2014 measurements, cal-\nculations\u2014 given in cubits and degrees, are evidence of a sophisticated attempt at reconciling\nonce mysterious motions with numerical allocation, while the glosses concerning obstruction\nof visibility by bad weather are indicative of diligent observation.\u201d\n\nThere is nothing spurious about these astronomical diaries\u2014nothing magical, mythologi-\ncal, or even faintly oracular. They are a mere record of the night by night occurrences con-\ncerning the heavenly bodies\u2014hence the term \u201cdiaries\u2019\u2014month by month, throughout the\nyear. Were it not for the historical events that they also report, they would probably have in-\nspired less interest among scholars. Astronomically, they are nothing but a catalogue of the\nsame boring celestial events that we see enacted in the sky above us to this day. But they are\naccurate \u2014so that a modern student of astronomy would not have been embarrassed had he\nor she been the author of the diaries.
