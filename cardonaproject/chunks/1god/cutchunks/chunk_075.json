    "content": "What is left is to explain how a Birkeland current is made visible. After all, since it, too,\nfollows Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field lines, Io\u2019s flux tube is also a Birkeland current.>? It thus turns\nout, after all, that Lynn Rose\u2019s postulate is not as unsound as | had originally assumed. As\nstressed earlier, however, Io\u2019s flux tube is not optically visible. Neither are the Sun\u2019s pole-\nward emissions. As we have indicated, the mythological axis mundi, on the other hand,\nseems to have been very much visible. So are astral jets. Under what conditions, then, can a\nBirkeland current be made visible as a twisted ray of light? Needless to say, this might not be\nthe right question to ask, especially since Birkeland currents have already been explained as\ninvisible power transmission lines. Even so, as the plasma physicist Anthony Peratt stated at\nthe Laughlin World Conference sponsored by KRONIA Communications on July 8, 2001, a\nBirkeland current can be made visible through the detritus it may collect about it. What is,\nhowever, really visible is the plasma through which these currents flow. To be sure, the\nplasma itself needs to be made visible.\n\nAccording to the electrical engineer, Don Scott, there are three different modes in which\na plasma can operate, and these depend on the strength of the electrical current passing\nthrough it. In what is known as the dark current mode, where the electrical current is very\nlow, the plasma will not glow and, therefore, remains invisible. It can only be detected\nthrough the measurement of its electrical activity with sensitive instruments. As Scott ex-\nplains, the present magnetospheres of the Solar System planets \u201care examples of plasma op-\nerating in the dark current mode.\u201d But if the strength of the electrical current is \u201csignificant,\u201d\nthe entire plasma begins to glow, its brightness being naturally dependent on the strength of\nthe current. If the electrical current is very high, the plasma goes into arc mode, during which\nit \u201cradiates brilliantly over a wide spectrum,\u201d with the current tending to form the filaments\nwe are now becoming familiar with.*3\n\nBut, with a current of 400,000 volts, why does Io\u2019s flux tube not glow? As Peratt ex-\nplains, given the size of the system, this is not a \u201cterribly impressive\u201d amplitude. Translating\ninto one mega-ampere, it even falls short of the seven mega-amperes conducted by Earth\u2019s\ncircular auroras, made visible in Earth\u2019s northern and southern polar skies (even though this\nvaries considerably).34 So that while it is the strength of the current passing through a plasma\nthat accounts for its ability to glow, this strength has to be considered in relation to the size of\nthe system that spawns it or, better said, in relation to the magnitude of the plasma itself. As\nScott explains further, it is not the actual current in total amperes that is the real issue, but the\ncurrent density, that is the amount of amperes per square meter.35\n\nActually, Peratt defines the situation even further and, at the risk of befuddling the lay\nreader, I hereby include his words for the benefit of the specialists. As he stated, whether a\nplasma glows or not relies on how energetic the relativistic electrons happen to be, plus the\nstrength of the magnetic field, \u201cas this determines the intensity of synchrotron radiation the\nelectrons beam towards Earth.\u201d3\u00b0 Those who are interested enough can consult his major\nwork on the subject.37\n\nAs for our own proto-Saturnian polar column\u2014or \u201cpolar Birkeland current\u201d \u2014Peratt es-\ntimates it to have probably carried something like \u201ca thousand mega-ampere into and out of",

    "content": "\nthe planetary polar regions.\u201d 38\nAs earlier stated, it would not be correct to claim that proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column was a\nstellar jet comparable to Herbig Haro objects. Even if scaled down from stellar amplitudes to\nbrown dwarf magnitudes, such jets would remain colossally active in their electrical mani-\nfestation. It is more than probable that proto-Saturn\u2019s polar ray did originate as such a jet, but\nit is doubtful that it still retained its full potential by the time man came upon the scene.\nAs Ken Moss suggested, it would have been more likely that the polar ray mankind re-\nmembers was, at best, the remnant of an original jet.3? And why not? After all, cosmic jets\nare known to fade. As Peratt disclosed in 1992:\n\u201cComparison of the integrated magnitude of the jet in M87 over the period 1934-1980\nshows that the jet is variable and has been fading, more or less uniformly, by about\n0.8 mag per decade between 1964 and 1980. The data imply that over the period\n1952-1980, the total jet intensity fell by at least 2.5 mag. Comparisons of isophotes\ntaken in 1964 and 1979 show no obvious differences in overall shape, apart from ef-\nfects of variation and noise. This indicates that the fading has affected the whole\nchannel uniformly since 1964...\u201d4\u00b0\nThat jets fade is exemplified by our present Sun. The present poleward fields emanating\nfrom the Sun are so relatively weak that they operate in the dark mode. It is, however, doubt-\nful that they always did so.\nAs we shall soon see, brown dwarfs are believed to degenerate into giant gas planets.\nWhat this additionally means is that any jets spawned by such free floaters, already scaled\ndown, would necessarily continue to decay in their electrical amplitude. We have no way of\nknowing at what exact phase in its evolution the proto-Saturnian brown dwarf star had ar-\nrived at during the time of man, prior to its entry into our Solar System. It, however, seems\nreasonable to assume that it was well along its way in its evolutionary transformation. Even\nthe word \u201cjet\u201d might be misleading here where \u201ca sustained Birkeland current\u201d might much\nbetter fill the nomenclative bill.\nDespite all that, none of the above is to say that proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column was devoid\nof electrical activity, or that this activity failed to manifest itself in catastrophic dimensions.\nIt should, however, be emphasized that, during man\u2019s existence on Earth, the polar column\ndid not always exhibit its full tornadic force and, if we are to believe the mytho-historical re-\ncord, its twisted serpentine character was not always apparent. As seen from latitudinal dis-\ntance, very much as Thornhill intuited, the column would have appeared \u201clike a spectacular\nauroral effect,\u201d a tapering swath of light stretching all the way from proto-Saturn to Earth\u2019s\nnorth axial pole, a thing of beauty, even one of tranquility. Yes\u2014it would have been seen to\nwhirl, perhaps even accompanied by an electric hum. It is even possible that ancient man at-\ntempted to approach it. But as one came ever closer to it, its vibrational envelope, to say\nnothing of an electrical feel similar to that encountered prior to a storm, would have been felt\nas a warning against further approach.\nTHE ARCTIC DEPRESSION\nSuch a planetary tornado, in the form of a rotating sustained Birkeland current, acting\ncontinuously over the same area in Earth\u2019s north polar region, scouring the land underneath,\nshould have left an indelible scar. As it happens, small as it is compared to the Pacific and",

    "content": "Atlantic, the Arctic Ocean \u201ccontains four depressions of oceanic depth which, unlike other\noceans, hold large volumes of sediment.\u201d4! This bespeaks a different method from other\noceans by which these sediments were collected. Charles Ginenthal understood this extra\nthick sediment as having been deposited by \u201ca global, oceanic tidal wave, flowing north-\nward.\u201d42 This is a theory that has also been proposed by Jueneman.* As the latter indicated,\nhowever, such a flood, acting through waves of translation, would have been subject to\nEarth\u2019s rotation and would have swept from the equator in a colossal spiraling tide toward\nboth poles, to say nothing of travelling back toward the equator.\u201c That being the case, these\nwaves should just as easily have deposited their load of sediment in other land-encircled seas\nwhich would have been in their path, such as Hudson\u2019s Bay and the Black, Caspian, and\nBaltic Seas. Why, then, do we not find a similar thick load of sediment in these depressions?\n\nIt is not that Earth\u2019s Arctic region has not been inundated by an immense flood\u2014which\nsubject is also reserved for a future volume\u2014but this would have entailed an entirely differ-\nent mechanism.*> Under the scheme presented here, it seems more reasonable to suppose that\nthe thick sediment of the Arctic Ocean was created in situ by the constant scouring of the\ntornadic polar column.\n\nAlso, as we have seen, Earth\u2019s boreal lithospheric bulge would have risen because of\nproto-Saturn\u2019s proximity. The tidal heaping of Earth\u2019s interior magma, however, would have\nactually been greater than at the surface. The thermal energy which would have resulted from\nthe friction between this molten material and the enveloping crust would have enhanced the\nmagma\u2019s mobility. This heated plastic matter would then have broken through the surface,\ncausing a collapse of the crust. This is precisely what has been discovered in the Eurasian\nBasin of the Arctic Ocean, an area which \u201crepresents a regional collapse of the Earth\u2019s sur-\nface due to material being removed from the lower mantle.\u201d\n\nEven more recently, a swirling vortex of molten rock has been discovered 3000 kilome-\nters beneath the North Pole.4\u201d Peter Olson and Jonathan Aurnou, then from the Johns Hop-\nkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, traced a flow of almost a quarter of a degree per year\nin a region some 2400 kilometers across. As Olson stated, the flow \u201chas the structure of a gi-\nant hurricane.\u201d48\n\nThere is, incidentally, no point in claiming that these effects could have been caused by a\ndifferent set of circumstances. What is stressed here is that this is precisely what our theory\ndemands and, in that respect, the demand is met. In conjunction with the other physical evi-\ndence from the same region supplied in earlier chapters of this work (to say nothing of what\nwe intend to add in coming volumes), the accumulating signs continue to build up in our the-\nory\u2019s favor.\n\nOne more problem yet to be solved concerns the manner in which Earth came to be\nlocked within proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column. This, however, is going to take us on a final tan-",

As we have already seen, red and brown dwarfs are believed to\n\u201coccupy the middle ground between planets and stars.\u201d4? But the demarcation between stars,\ndwarf stars, and planets seems forever to be changing. To make matters worse, along the way\na new class of free-floating objects were discovered that were \u201clighter than the lightest brown\ndwarf and heavier than the heaviest planets.\u201d> While less massive than brown dwarfs, some\nastronomers have questioned the use of the word \u201cplanets\u201d to describe them. Other problems\nhave been listed besides their massiveness. Thus, to give one lame example, it has. been. cal-\nculated that the objects lurking in the globular cluster known as M22 \u201cmake up as much as\n10 percent of the cluster\u2019s mass\u2014 too numerous to be wandering \u2018orphaned\u2019 planets.\u201d>! As if\nquantity has any bearing in the classifying of astronomical bodies.\nAlan Boss settled on the term \u201csub-brown dwarfs\u201d as a designation for these free-floaters.\nBut, as Glen Schneider opined: \u201cGive a billion years of cooling and evolution, and these ob-\njects may be indistinguishable from planets.\u201d52 This is primarily because it is believed that\nthese objects are still contracting, \u201ccollapsing because of their own gravity.\u201d As Maria Za-\npatero-Osorio stated: \u201cWith time, they will look like Jupiter and Saturn.\u201d*? And did not Carl\nSagan claim that, at least in the infrared part of its spectrum, \u201cit might even be correct to con-\nsider Jupiter a star\u201d?\u21224 Did not Mark Marley more recently note that: \u201cIf you line a mug shot\nof Jupiter up with these guys, it [i.e., Jupiter] is just a very low-mass brown dwarf.\u201d?55 And if\nJupiter, why not then Saturn? All of which eliminates the objection concerning whether such\na brown dwarf star\u2014or should we say sub-brown dwarf star?\u2014could ever turn into the\nplanet Saturn as proposed in the present work. But what of the stated billion years said to be\nrequired for such a transformation?\nUnanimity among astrophysicists seems to be as rare as that among politicians. Thus,\nquite recently, when Goran Sandell discovered what he believes to be a \u201cmonster of a proto-\nstar\u201d in the Cepheus constellation, near the emission nebula known as NGC 7538, he claimed\nthat it, and others like it, could develop into a high-mass star \u201cin an astronomical blink of an\neye\u2014only about 10,000 years.\u201d\nBack in 1977, astronomers focused on a disk-shaped object in the constellation Cygnus\nwhich was identified as an evolving star. Not only that, it was said that it \u201ccould well be a\nsun in the process of forming its own planets.\u201d Although the object, dubbed MWC\n349, had been known since the 1930s, it was only now that they \u201crealized how unusual it",

(approximately 140 million miles) in\ndiameter.\u201d>8 The strange thing about this, however, is that the star was believed to be \u201clittle\nmore than 10,000 years old,\u201d even though it is believed to be still developing.>\u00b0 Stranger still\nwas the rate at which it was developing. As stated in the periodical in question:\n\u201cSuch a process can sometimes take millions of years. But scientists will not have to\nwait that long to see how MWC 349\u2019s birth turns out. At the rate at which the disc is\ndisappearing, it will be gone in a mere 100 years.\u201d\u00a9\nAnother star, FG Sagittae, has been said to be evolving so rapidly, it can actually be seen\nchanging color as it moves from one theoretical phase to another. This star has already\nchanged from blue to yellow over a mere 40 years.\nIn view of these cases, it does not seem reasonable to assume that a body so much less\nmassive would take a billion years to form. Coincidentally or not, 10,000 years is precisely\nthe amount of time Sam Flamsteed claimed it would take a brown dwarf star to turn into a\nJupiter sized planet. \u00a9\nAdditionally, it is believed by some that brown dwarf stars do not shine like stars, even\nthough they generate enough heat to be detected by infrared-sensing instruments.\u00ae Stuart\nGoldman, on the other hand, seems to disagree when he speaks of \u201cthe visible [although\nfeeble] light from such stellar embers.\u201d And, according to the editors of Astronomy, thirty\nnewly discovered brown dwarf stars in Rho Ophiuchi are considered to be young enough to\nallow them \u201cto glow slightly brighter than their older relatives.\u201d\u00ae> This is precisely what we\nhave been proposing for the brown dwarf star that was proto-Saturn in the past pages of this\nvolume.\nIn the interim, models based on the known characteristics of these dwarfs have been cre-\nated in order to ascertain what these sub-stellar bodies actually look like.
