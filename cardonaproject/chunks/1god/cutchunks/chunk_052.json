Jill Abery, on the other\nhand, was not quite happy with this identification or with any of the others mentioned\nabove\u2014and rightly so. As she opined:\n\n\u201cQuetzalcoatl is a very ancient god with a multiple of aspects. As the feathered ser-\npent, readers of Velikovsky will have no difficulty in identifying him as Venus in\ncometary garb. But beyond this he is the Lord of healing, learning, beauty, creativity\nand vegetation. He was a benefactor who brought to men the use of metals and the\narts of government; who ruled in an age of perfumed, melodious plenty which can be\nregarded as the Golden Age of Mesoamerica...It would [therefore] appear that Quet-\nzalcoatl was originally the Mesoamerican equivalent of Osiris or Saturn.\u201d\n\nWould that mainstream mythologists had been as astute. Abery, of course, was not the\nfirst to ferret out the true identity of Quetzalcoatl,\u201d but I mention her especially because her\nintuition exemplifies what can be gleaned by a mind which is not constrained by orthodox\nviews.\n\nWhat has confused the issue, and many a mythologist, is the Mesoamerican belief that\nwhen Quetzalcoatl died, his heart flew up and turned into the Morning Star,\u00ae which star has\nbeen usually understood as Venus when it appears in the morning\u00ae\u2014an event that, as we\nhave seen on an earlier page, is duplicated in the mythology of the Egyptian Osiris/Saturn.\nWhat mythologists and archaeoastronomers seem to forget is that it was the heart of\nQuetzalcoatl, and not Quetzalcoatl himself, which turned into the Morning Star. Quetzalcoatl\nand the Morning Star were thus two entirely different entities.\n\nLet me now state that nowhere in Mesoamerican lore is Quetzalcoatl identified as Saturn.\nIf this identification is to hold, it must do so on the evidence offered by comparative\nmythology.\n\nLike the Saturnian deity of other nations, Quetzalcoatl was considered as the creator.\u201d\nLike the Saturnian deity of other nations, as Abery indicated, Quetzalcoatl was also a\ncivilizer.\u201d As in the Saturnian myths of other nations, Quetzalcoatl was the original one and\nonly god.

And yet, the depiction in question incorporates the sign for \u201cnight\u201d with that of To-\nnatiuh,\u201d thus intimating that Tonatiuh and, by inference, also Quetzalcoatl, was a sun of\nnight.
