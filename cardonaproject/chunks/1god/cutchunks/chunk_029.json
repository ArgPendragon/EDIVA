    "content": "\nnos, whom we already know to have been a sky-god: Ouranos means the coverer,\nbut...the name would have remained unintelligible apart from its reference to the\nSanskrit name.\u201d3!\nGiven the equivocalness of translation, we are not surprised to find Wendy O\u2019Flaherty\ngiving the meaning of the name Varuna as \u201call-enveloping.\u201d32 Even so, and once again, tem-\nporarily leaving aside the god\u2019s assimilation to the sky, we find that Varuna was sometimes\nsimply called Aditya\u2014\u201ceternal, celestial light\u201d33\u2014-which, like the other deities in the series\nwe have been considering, identifies the deity as a celestial body.\nLike the Saturnian deities of other nations, Varuna was considered \u201cthe first Sovereign\u201d 34\nand \u201cuniversal monarch.\u201d35 While Ovid spoke of \u201cyellow-eyed Saturn,\u201d3\u00b0 Varuna was said to\nhave had yellow eyes.3\u201d\nTrue, some may consider the above as rather slim evidence on which to base the identity\nof Varuna as Saturn but, in following chapters, more will be presented. All that needs to be\nre-stated here is that, like Janus, with whom we are presently mainly concerned, the above\nseries of gods were all believed to have represented that entity which the Greeks called\nkosmos and which, among modern mythologists, has come down to symbolize the sky or\nheaven. Using the old adage that things which are equal to the same thing must be equal to\none another, one can therefore assume that, since the deities enumerated above are all, to\nsome extent, identifiable as avatars of the Saturnian deity, then so must Janus be identified.\nActually, the above series of identifications has been presented more as an exercise in\ncomparative mythology, and as a basis for coming chapters, than as evidence for the Saturn-\nian identity of Janus since the comparisons are not really required to make our case. As will\nbe seen directly below, we have direct evidence at our disposal.\nSATURNUS\nThat Janus was merely another name for Saturn was known and acknowledged by the\nancients themselves. Thus, in describing the New Year Festival, which we have already seen\naffiliated with the Saturnian planet through the Persian feast of Nauroz, Joannes Lydus had\nthis to say:\n\u201cOur own Philadelphia still preserves a trace of the ancient belief. On the first day of\nthe month [that is January, named after Janus] there goes in procession no less a per-\nsonage than Janus himself, dressed up in a two-faced mask, and people call him Sat-\nurnus, identifying him with Kronos.\u201d38\nHere I must at once state that there is no point in claiming that Janus and Saturnus are\npresented as different deities in the Roman pantheon or that the quote from Lydus is too late,\ndating from the sixth century, for any credence to be attached to it. In the first place, it was\nnot Lydus who called Janus by the name Saturnus. It was, as he tells us, the people who did\nso. In other words, he was reporting general belief. More than that, as Lydus himself stated,\nthe knowledge he imparted still preserved \u201ca trace of the ancient belief,\u201d meaning that the",

As noted earlier, and as has been recognized by others, there is nothing\nstrange about having different deities, even within the same pantheon, as personifying the\nsame celestial object. As far as Janus is concerned, he could be considered an older Saturn\u2014\nCook had no qualms about making him an older Jupiter,3? with which this author naturally\ndisagrees.\nTo be fair, since I mentioned him, Cook did not accept the statement of Lydus\u2014 bur not\nbecause he considered the source as a late one. \u201cThe confusion of Ianus [the same as Janus]\nwith Kronos,\u201d he tells us, \u201cno doubt presupposes the usual blunder Kronos = Chronos [that is\nTime personified], which from the fifth century B.C. onwards queered the course of Greek\ntheology.\u201d4\u00b0\nWhy did Cook bring this point up? He did so because he could not avoid the veneration\nof Janus as a god of time, or Time personified,*! which, through the rules of comparative\nmythology, would equate the Italic deity with the Greek Chronos. But, in the first place, ac-\ncording to Lydus, his countrymen did not call Janus by the name Kronos. They called him by\nthe name Saturnus. The identification with Kronos was added because Kronos was simply\nthe Greek counterpart of the Italic Saturnus. In the second place, as will be indicated in detail\nin a later chapter of this work, the blunder concerning the identification of Kronos/Saturn\nwith Chronos/Time happens to be Cook\u2019s. In fact, as we shall soon see, the identification of\nJanus as Saturn does not rest solely on the statement of Lydus but also on the comparison of\nthis deity\u2019s characteristics with those of the known Saturnian deities of other nations. Thus,\nfor instance, William Heidel speaks of \u201cthe recognized association of Saturn with Janus\u201d 4?",

The implication here is\nclear. If ancient man could remember a time when Saturn appeared as a sphere to the\nunaided eye, Saturn would had to have been closer to Earth.\nTHE DOGON MYSTERY\nAt this point I wish to introduce a few items which archaeoastronmers have found quite\nbewildering. I start with the astronomical knowledge of the Dogon of Mali of what had once\nbeen the French Sudan, in Africa.\nThanks to the writings of Marcel Griaule, Germaine Dieterlen, and Robert Temple, the\nDogon, once a little-known tribe with some very curious rituals, have now been placed on the\ntourist map. But more than their exotic costumes, bizarre masks, dances, and commemorative\nfestivals, these people have become increasingly renowned for their astronomical lore. As\nEdwin Krupp reported:\n\u201cCounting the phases of the moon, keeping track of the configurations of Venus, and\nwatching the arrivals and departures of the stars are all part of Dogon practical as-\ntronomy. The Dogon recognizes 266 stars or asterisms and associate them with 266\npictographic symbols that are painted on rock shelters, altars, and other shrines.\u201d49\nThe Moon, say the Dogon, \u201cis dry and dead like dry dead blood.\u201d>\u00b0 They know that the\nplanets, which they call tolo tanaze \u2014that is \u201cstars that turn (around something)\u201d>! revolve\naround the Sun. They claim that \u201cJupiter follows Venus by turning slowly around the sun.\u201d52\nThey possess four different kinds of calendar\u2014a solar calendar, a lunar calendar, a Venus\ncalendar, and, remarkably, one based on the star known to us as Sirius.\u00b03 Either through in-\ntuition or otherwise, the Dogon are of the belief that an infinite number of stars and an infi-\nnite number of planets, together with their satellites, exist.\nWhat mostly interests us here, however, has to do with what they have to say in relation\nto Saturn. Concerning this planet, the Dogon \u201caffirm there is a permanent halo around the\nstar, different from the one sometimes seen around the moon.\u201d55 Their own drawing of Sat-\nurn actually shows the planet, depicted as a circle, distinctly surrounded by a ring. Saturn is\nalso known to them as \u201cthe star of limiting the place,\u201d which probably alludes to the fact\nthat Saturn is the outermost planet among those visible to the naked eye.\nAs Krupp was later to admit, these astronomical traditions of the Dogon \u201cwere bound to\ncause consternation among astronomers, for it seems impossible to reconcile the Dogon as-\ntronomical knowledge...with their instrumental resources, namely the unaided eye.\u201d57 While\nGriaule and Dieterlen did not, themselves, come to a definite conclusion concerning how the\nDogon came upon their astronomical lore, Robert Temple, who built an edifice on their",
