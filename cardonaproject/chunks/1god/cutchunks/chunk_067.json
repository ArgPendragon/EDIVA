    "content": "Together with that of Lynn Rose, which has already been treated of in past pages of this\nwork, there were other competing models based on the Saturnian phenomena which appeared\nthroughout the years.? Although still purportedly based on the content of the mytho-historical\nrecord, some of them did not even involve planets!!\u00b0 None of these had any light to shed on\nthe problem of Earth\u2019s axial coupling with Saturn.\n\nMeanwhile, from the very inception of his model, Talbott had opted for the planet Jupiter\nhaving attained a position \u201cabove\u201d Saturn, in line with Saturn and Earth, but not in axial\nalignment with them. According to this scheme, Saturn and Earth would have rotated on their\nsingle axis \u201cextending out from Jupiter.\u201d This would have meant that, from the vantage point\nof Earth, Jupiter would have been hidden behind Saturn and thus not visible to Earth-bound\nobservers. !!\n\nRight from the start, the above scheme did not sit well with me because I had not come\nacross anything in the mythic record that could be made to account for this hidden aspect of\nthe planet Jupiter or any god identifiable as such. And, as of this writing, Talbott has yet to\npresent the evidence on which he continues to base this particular hypothesis.\n\nI, on the other hand, had toyed with the idea of placing Jupiter at the other end of the con-\nfiguration with Earth stationed in between the two giant planets. Thus Jupiter would have ap-\npeared stationary in Earth\u2019s south polar sky. Such a configuration, or so I reasoned at the\ntime, would have lessened the instability problem since Earth would have been\ngravitationally attracted to both giants without succumbing to either. !2 This idea had been\nfed fuel by a few mythological tidbits which name the planet Jupiter as the Star of the South.\n\nThus, in the Persian Bundahish it is stated how the \u201cseven chieftains of the planets have\ncome unto the seven chieftains of the constellations\u201d where the planet Jupiter is matched with\nthe constellation which the ancient Persians called Vanand.!3 Elsewhere in the same work,\nVanand is described as \u201cthe chieftain of the south,\u201d!4 which would make Jupiter the planet of\nthe south.\n\nIn Hindu astro-mythology, Brihaspati, which is the Sanskrit name for the planet Jupiter, !>\nis also linked \u201cwith the fire of the south.\u201d!6\n\nIn Egyptian astronomy of the Ptolemaic period, the southern stars were held sacred to\nHorus !7 who, as Heru-Up-Shetau!8 and/or Heru-pe-sheta (Heru-ap-sheta and/or Heru-ap-\nsheta-taui), was one of the names of the planet Jupiter. !9 In fact, among other things, Horus",

The title of the paper itself\u2014\u201cThe Plausibility of the Po-\nlar Saturn\u201d \u2014was such a positive statement that it made me devour its contents with childlike\neagemess.\nSherrerd had no apprehension about stating that such a planetary system was \u201cnot only\nplausible but likely.\u201d He considered that a linear configuration, with Jupiter and Saturn at one\nend and Earth in the middle, \u201cis a feasible and stable arrangement according to well-known\nprinciples of modern physics.\u201d23\nFurther research on my part, however, indicated that deities other than those identified as\nthe planet Jupiter were also associated with the south. For instance, the Mexican gods Tez-\ncatlipoca and Huitzilopochtli are both designated as rulers of the south.?4 These two deities,\nhowever, fit the role of Mars better than they do that of Jupiter,25 very much as Velikovsky\nhad earlier surmised.26 Worse still, in Roman mythology, Jupiter, like Saturn, was associated\nwith the north rather than the south.\u201d It thus became apparent that Jupiter\u2019s claim to the\nsouth, as also, incidentally, his claim to the north, had to do with something entirely different\n(concerning which, in order to keep events in a chronological order, I will have to write in a\nsubsequent volume). I was therefore left with no recourse but to abandon this line of\ninvestigation.\nDue to lack of editorial concurrence, Sherrerd\u2019s paper was never published. Nevertheless,\nthe barbell formation theory refused to go away. So much so that, in 1988, Talbott, too,\nthought it prudent to pay it some notice. As he wrote:\n\u201cMore than one physical model, in order to preserve stability (or at least a semblance\nthereof), would suggest a line up of planets in the fashion of a tumbling barbell, with\nthe larger orbs balancing the two ends of the planetary assembly and the Earth locked\nin polar alignment between them. On this theoretical principle I can express no opin-\nion, though applying the principle to the mythically-supported planetary line-up does\nyield some interesting results.\u201d*8\nBut since Talbott had alrerady opted for Jupiter\u2019s locality behind Saturn, he ended up by\nsuggesting the introduction of yet one more planet.

    "content": "\n\u201cMy proposed sequence of northern planets, of course, was never influenced by this\nbalancing mechanism. It may be significant, however, that the concept would seem to\nsupport the suggested relative positions of the planets...While this does not answer\nthe question as to what large planets might have balanced the other end of the barbell\n(for which question myth offers no help), the logical candidates would surely be first\nNeptune and then Uranus.\u201d?\u00b0\nThis, in turn, was picked up by Frederick Hall, a retired engineer from the Stanford\nLinear Accelerator Laboratory:\n\u201cProto-Saturn [he wrote] is not alone. In the fashion of a binary system, it is accom-\npanied by the smaller Neptune, except Neptune is not stellar.\u201d3\u00b0\nRobert Driscoll, a physicist from Caltech, did not seem to give Neptune\u2019s participation in\nthe Saturnian configuration any thought. Whether he already knew of Sherrerd\u2019s theory\nwhich had suggested Jupiter as the other member of the barbell formation, or whether he\ncame to this tentative conclusion on his own, I have no way of knowing. But it is the Saturn-\nJupiter barbell formation that he saw fit to analyze through a series of mathematical-physical\nequations.3! This was encouraging, to say the least, because, for the very first time since\nthose physicists I had accosted earlier, someone had attempted to quantify the solution to the\nco-axial quandary inherent in the proposed Saturnian system.\nBut even here, there were still some problems.\nAccording to Driscoll, the Saturnian system came into being within the Solar System it-\nself when an unnamed gaseous super-giant went through nuclear fissioning, thus instigating a\nseries of minor calamities resulting in aerodynamic drags, shrinking and rounding of orbits,\nelectric charges, cancellation of gravitational attractions, centrifugal forces, the combined\ninfluence of which resulted in Earth being captured between Jupiter and Saturn.32\nThat, in brief, was Driscoll\u2019s theory. There would be no point here in presenting it in\nmore detail and/or reproducing its attendant equations since these would be beyond the com-\nprehension of most of my readers.33\nSeven years later, Driscoll returned to the topic in a longer paper in which he not only\nconsidered the barbell model with Earth captured between Jupiter and Saturn, but also, and\nmainly, Talbott\u2019s original, and still adhered-to, prototype in which Jupiter is placed behind\nSaturn. In this attempt, the aerodynamic forces relied on previously were eliminated, with the\nstability of the system now more heavily dependent upon the Sun\u2019s gravitational attraction.*+\nWhile I welcomed its greater detail and additional equations, I was less happy with this\nversion than I was with Driscoll\u2019s earlier attempt. Nor did a still further, but much shorter,\npaper by him, with yet more equations, add anything substantially new to his theory.3>\nTalbott\u2019s model, in which the co-axial Saturnian system is made to orbit Jupiter equatori-\nally as a rigid rod, received something of a dubious boost from the structural dynamicist,\nRobert Grubaugh, who specialized in placing satellites into orbit.%\u00b0 In this scheme, the two",

Several calculations were performed by\nGrubaugh to \u201cdemonstrate that the alignment is feasible according to the laws of Newtonian\ngravitation, and that the magnitude of torque necessary to produce the required precession is\nwithin the realm of possibility.\u201d Once again, it is not necessary to reproduce these calcula-\ntions here and interested parties are asked to consult the original documents cited.\n\nWhile no other physical model of the Saturnian configuration had until then received as\nmuch attention as Grubaugh\u2019s proposed model did, it had its ups and downs. In the end,\neven Talbott, at whose instigation Grubaugh had patterned his hypothesis, discovered a flaw\nin Grubaugh\u2019s model, although it was not one affecting his calculations. What Talbott real-\nized is that, physically verifiable as it may be, Grubaugh\u2019s model did not conform to his own\nscenario as he had constructed it on the basis of the mytho-historical model. This problem\nwas also picked up by Wallace Thornhill.4! Worse than that, Thornhill also found fault with\nGrubaugh\u2019s system, and therefore, to an extent, also Talbott\u2019s, as a whole.*?\n\nIn 1999, Emilio Spedicato, physicist and head of Mathematics at the University of Ber-\ngamo, Italy, next applied his hand to the problem.* Like others before him, he, too, produced\nan impressive array of equations which, at least numerically, were found to be in agreement\nwith the Saturnian polar model. But, like others before him, he also envisioned the system as\nhaving resided within the Sun\u2019s sphere of influence.\n\nNevertheless, Spedicato did manage to show that, at least mathematically, the co-axial\nsystem would have been stable even under Newtonian constraints. He could not, however,\nvouch for the length of time the stability of the system could have prevailed.\n\nA year later, Spedicato teamed up with Antonio Del Popolo, an astrophysicist who was\nthen also at the University of Bergamo, in a further attempt to quantify the inherent stability\nof the proposed Saturnian co-axial system and, more importantly, to see how long the system\nwould have remained stable.\n\nTo the chagrin of some, the obtained results from the equations involved did not confirm\nthe required sustained dynamical stability of the model.45 On the contrary, it was found that\nthe stability of such an axially aligned system would be lost \u201crather fast, with its maximum\nduration corresponding to only about 3 months\u201d when its \u201cexpected stability should extend at\nleast over several thousand years.\u201d4\u00a9 Spedicato and Del Popolo did, however, concede that:",

His main criticism centered on what he deemed to be the gargantuan\ncataclysmic destruction on Earth that would have resulted during and after the break-down of\nthe Saturnian system.*\u00b0\nWhat remained curious about Ashton\u2019s recantation is that, despite all his objections, he\ndid not discard the Saturnian model or its accompanying scenario. How could he when he\nhimself had spent hours of research, especially in Sanskrit literature, and reams of paper,*! in\nsuccessfully verifying the model\u2019s basic premises?> In fact, in a 1987 paper of his which, as\nof this writing, has not yet seen publication, he stressed his belief that the so-called Saturnian\napparition from which \u201cthe metaphors of myth\u201d can retrospectively be derived can be con-\nsidered the very bedrock of myth.*? But then, reverting to the old canard that the identifica-\ntion of deities with planets is late, he convinced himself that the Saturnian apparition, as it\nmight have appeared in man\u2019s ancient sky, had nothing to do with planets. Apart from the\nfact that this is verifiably untrue, he seems to have forgotten that, in many instances, ancient\nrecords speak specifically of planets besides their corresponding deities, as shown in earlier\npages of this work. Even so, if not planets, what? What was it that Ashton believed was re-\nsponsible for the so-called Saturnian apparition? I quote directly from the paper concerned:\n\u201cTo abandon the planetary and retain the north celestial polar aspect of the primeval\ngods allows for an open and unbiased approach to the question of whether there was\never any original physical basis for mythical conceptions. Until the thesis set forth in\nthe course of this essay receives some measure of physical verification, it is still eas-\nily conceivable that the material of myth is due to subjective, visionary, psychic,\nmystic, metaphysical, cryptic, subliminal, or, if one can stomach the idea, occult fac-\ntors. This may be true no matter how neatly mythical motifs coalesce into one com-\nposite image retrospectively, and no matter how well the archaeological finds...may\nseem to attest that coalescence.\u201d 55\nHe was, however, obviously unhappy with this so, in lieu of it, he did forward a physical\nmodel of sorts, one which turns out to be even more bizarre than the planetary model he no\nlonger espoused.
