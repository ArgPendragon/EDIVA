Indeed numerical inte-\ngrations backward in time could take the system, still well behaved, through the\nepisode of wild behaviour as if it had never been.\u201d3\u00b0\nOvenden himself went even further when he theorized that the close approach of planets\nto each other is not only possible but possibly inherent in the very nature of the cosmos.?!\nFrom this he also reached the conclusion that \u201ca system of planets (or satellites) will change\nits configuration slowly when the planets are far apart\u201d but \u201cquickly when they are close to-\ngether and interacting violently.\u201d32\nThis brings us to W. M. Smart who, in 1953, had already understood that such\n\u201cperturbation series\u201d could not be relied upon except for a very short time\u2014one or two\ncenturies\u201d to be exact.33 Later, Bass demonstrated that:\n\u201c,..it is perfectly possible, according to Newton\u2019s Laws of Dynamics and Gravitation\nwhen three or more bodies are involved, for planets to nearly collide and then relax\ninto an apparently stable Bode\u2019 Law type of configuration within a relatively short\ntime. ..\u201d34\ntime...\u201d34\nMoreover, by \u201ca relatively short time,\u201d Bass meant \u201cin a few centuries.\u201d35\nIf it can therefore be shown that the planets approached and interacted with each other\nduring the age of man, the resonances inherent in Bode\u2019s Law will not admit to dating in\nmillions of years. And, on this issue, the historical record seems to be clear enough even if\nstill unrecognized by most conventionalists.\nRETROACTIVE CALCULATIONS\nWhat then of retroactive calculations (or retrocalculations, for short)? Retrocalculation \u201cis\nthe method which relies on the assumption that the Earth has been behaving in a nice sedate\nuniformitarian manner, and it is assumed that it is possible to calculate backwards in time to\nestablish the exact date of astronomical events.\u201d3\u00a2 Do not such calculations prove that no\nchange in the orbits or placements of the planets have taken place in the past? No, they do\nnot. As Leroy Ellenberger indicated when he was still a Velikovskian catastrophist: \u201cNo\nretro-calculations to date have been inherently capable of duplicating near-collisions [among\nthe planets] even if one occurred.\u201d37 William Mullen, too, observed that such retrocalcul-\nations are futile since they involve \u201ca problem rather like taking the position of a few billiard-\nballs towards the end of the game and calculating the positions of the complete set back to\nthe beginning.\u201d38 Or, as Warlow pointed out: \u201cIn fact, as far as the stability of the system is\nconcemed, there are experts in the field today who admit that, if we take the system in its\npresent state, it is only reasonable to calculate forward or backward in time for about three",

However,\u201d he continues, \u201cthey would admit that there is much we do not under-\nstand.\u201d40\nThe astronomers Victor Clube and Bill Napier are of the same mind:\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d they wrote, \u201cit is not generally possible to calculate past and future\norbits in great detail, small uncertainties magnifying rapidly. Most calculations in-\nvolving three or more solar system bodies are unreliable beyond a few hundred\nyears.\u201d41\nOr, as Jill Abery succinctly phrased it:\n\u201cForget all those old computer calculations of past and future behaviour of the Solar\nSystem. Mathematicians now realise that the system is too complicated for conven-\ntional computers to ever come up with the right answer. However, they have a new\nmathematical system which ignores the laws of motion in our familiar 3-dimensional\nspace. Interestingly it demonstrates that the Solar System\u2019s behaviour is very chaotic\nwith many possible scenarios.\u201d42\nLet us not forget the words of astronomer Archie Roy, reviewed above, to the effect that\n\u201cnumerical integrations backward in time could take the system, still well behaved, through\nthe episode of wild behaviour as if it had never been.\u201d\nIn the end, nobody put it better than Lynn Rose and Raymond Vaughan. \u201cRetrocalcula-\ntion is a very iffy business at best,\u201d they wrote. \u201cSuppose that a spacecraft was launched into\norbit this morning. Retrocalculation would show where that spacecraft was located on its or-\nbit at this same time yesterday, when it was still on its launching pad!\u201d43\nFORMER ORBITS\nAs Wallace Thornhill wrote in 1997, \u201cit is well known among astronomers that Newton\u2019s\nlaw of gravity when applied to more than 2 orbiting bodies results in chaotic motion after a\nrelatively short time.\u201d4+ But, more important than that, he also asked:\n\u201cHow can the solar system have remained in its apparently stable configuration for\nthe 5 aeons required by current theories of solar system evolution? And why, if the\nplanets and moons were formed from the same primordial cloud of gas and dust, are\nthey such a fruit salad of physical characteristics, axial tilts, rotation rates and or-\nbits?\u201d45\nbits?\u201d",

The \u2018Mercury as Venus\u2019s Moon\u2019 theory explains at one\nstroke many observations, such as the reduced/reversed spin of Venus, its massive\natmosphere, the 2/3 spin resonance of Mercury, the oblate shape of Mercury, and\nmany more.\u201d48\nGeorge Wetherhill posited an even wilder scenario for Mercury in which the planet had\noriginally orbited the Sun at Earth\u2019s present distance. Then, according to this particular the-\nory, Mercury was involved in a violent collision in which the planet was melted. A second\ncollision then resulted in the stripping away of Mercury\u2019s crust and its ejection out of its or-\nbit. Deflected from its path by Earth\u2019s gravity field, together with that of Venus, Mercury\neventually settled down into its present circular track.4\nAlan Stern, on the other hand, came out with a proposition of satellite capture, rather than\nescape. Not that the capture of satellites by planets had not been propounded before. But this\none deals with the planet Neptune and its companion, Triton, a moon the size of the planet\nPluto. Triton, it was found out, orbits Neptune in what astronomers call \u201cthe wrong direc-\ntion,\u201d that is clockwise as seen from \u201cabove,\u201d when all other satellites revolve counterclock-\nwise. The most likely explanation for this, according to Stern, is that Triton had once orbited\nfreely but, passing too close to Neptune, was captured by the larger planet as its moon.\nSo, similarly, with the planet Pluto which, until 1978, was still believed to be without a\nmoon. But a later ground-based photograph of Pluto revealed the presence of a\nsatellite\u2014since then named Charon\u2014 orbiting the planet. Because Charon is larger than our\nMoon, and one third as large as Pluto itself, Stern has said that it is \u201creally more accurate to\ncall this a double planet.\u201d>! Stern is thus of the opinion that these two planets had also once\norbited freely but that, coming too close, they managed to capture each other.52\nBut what of Earth itself? Has anyone before us ever posited that it, too, may have shifted?\nTHE SHIFTING EARTH\nAs Tom Yulsman reported:\n\u201cWe like to think that the Earth\u2019s orbit and the shape of its magnetic field are\nchangeless\u2014that as the years pass, the planet follows a rock-steady route about the\nSun while the compass points resolutely north. Not only is this not true, but scientists",
