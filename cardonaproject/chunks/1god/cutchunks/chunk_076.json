If a dwarf\nturns fast enough, the spin could drive the clouds into a stellar weather system much\nlike the bands on Jupiter.\u201d\nOr, one might add, also like the bands on Saturn\u2014although, to be sure, the proto-Sat-\nurnian latitudinal cloud bands only became apparent toward the end of the configuration\u2019s\nexistence.\nTHE ACCRETION DISK MODEL\nTogether with the existence of planets in extra-Solar systems, the discoveries enumerated\nabove have added further havoc to the current theory of planet formation. As Zapatero-\nOsorio has stated: \u201cThe formation of young, free-floating, planetary-mass objects like these\nis difficult to explain by our current models of how planets form.\u201d6 And: \u201cThe most\nintriguing question now is how can we explain the formation and evolution of planetary-mass\nobjects outside the solar system?\u201d And, in a press release: \u201cThese free floaters may pose a\nconsiderable challenge to current theories about how planets form.\u201d7!\nThere was a time when the formation of the Solar System planets was believed to have\nbeen due to material being drawn out of the Sun by a close passing star. This theory was\nhowever discarded in favor of the one now accepted in which the planets are theorized to\nhave formed from the same gas cloud that collapsed through its own gravity to form the Sun\nitself. The material remaining after the Sun had formed is said to have continued to circle the\nSun in its equatorial plane. Known as an accretion disk, this gaseous cloud continued to col-\nlapse into smaller clumps of matter, which clumps eventually aggregated into the planets and\nat least some of their accompanying satellites. There have been various other theories, but the\naccretion disk model became the one most widely accepted.\nWhen it comes to extra-solar systems, however, it has recently been discovered that the\naccretion process encounters difficulties. Thus, for instance, 90% of the young stars known to\nexist in the Orion nebula are surrounded by so-called accretion disks \u201cthat could potentially\nclump into new worlds.\u201d But, as Kathy Svitil noted, \u201cmaking a planet, it turns out, isn\u2019t all\nthat easy to do.\u201d72\n\u201cTRobert] O\u2019Dell christened these disks \u2018proplyds,\u2019 for protoplanetary disks. The\nname may actually be a misnomer, because these disks will evaporate within a mil-\nlion years, probably before planets can form.\u201d\n\u201cIntense radiation streaming from the nebula\u2019s brightest infant stars can stop the\nprocess in its tracks, says astronomer C. Robert O\u2019Dell of Vanderbilt University in\nNashville, Tennessee. \u2018Radiation evaporates away the disks in a few hundred thou-\nsand years or less,\u2019 he says, leaving little or no time for planets to coalesce.\u201d",

What makes this system doubly interesting is that, un-\nlike others previously discovered, it resembles mostly our own Solar System. One of these\nplanets has been calculated to have a mass equivalent to 2.6 that of Jupiter, with the other\ncontaining a mere 0.76 of Jupiter\u2019s mass. The two planets therefore \u201chave about the same\nmass ratio as Jupiter and Saturn.\u201d Moreover, unlike other previously discovered extra-solar\nsystems, the planets around 47 Ursae Majoris travel in circular, rather than elliptical, orbits.\nAs Debra Fischer noted: \u201cNow, for the first time, we have a system that looks like it had a\ngentle dynamical history, similar to our own solar system.\u201d What is germane to our present\ntopic, however, came to light when Greg Laughlin conducted a computer simulation of the\nsystem only to discover that \u201cthe gravity of the larger inner planet would jostle planetesimals\nin the star\u2019s habitable zone, preventing them from aggregating into a terrestrial planet.\u201d7\u201d\nGranted that the above may be considered unique examples, what about our own Solar\nSystem? Despite everything that had been claimed previously, back in 1960, W. H. McCrea\u2019s\ncalculations indicated that planets could not have originated by aggregation between the orbit\nof Jupiter and the Sun.\u201d8 That same year, R. A. Lyttleton confirmed this assumption through\nhis own calculations, again showing that the terrestrial planets, that is those within the orbit\nof Jupiter, could not have formed from the so-called accretion disk, but must have originated,\nby disruption, from the giant gaseous planets themselves.\u201d? Not everyone agreed, however,\nand, in 1979, Robert Jastrow was still claiming general ignorance when it came to the forma-\ntion of our Solar System\u2019s inner planets. As he wrote:\n\u201cWe can understand the birth of the giant planets of the solar system\u2014Jupiter, Saturn,\nUranus, and Neptune...But the smaller planets\u2014the earth, Mars, Venus and Mer-\ncury\u2014their origin is a mystery. Somehow they collected out of tiny grains of matter\nand developed into full-sized planets. We may never know exactly how the earth and\nits sister planets were born.\u201d8\u00b0\nBy 1997, there were other astrophysicists who began questioning the theory of planet\nformation through the core accretion mechanism,\u00ae! so that it eventually had to be admitted\nthat the accretion disk model falls flat on its face. By then, Uranus and Neptune were made to\njoin the terrestrial planets as being impossible to have been formed through the accretion\nprocess. As Joshua Roth stated: \u201cPity Uranus and Neptune...no one can even explain why\nthey exist.\u201d82 Agreeing with what has now become the general consensus, Roth declares that",

News of such a brown dwarf did not take long in coming.\n\nActually, there already had existed indirect evidence for several brown dwarfs orbiting\naround stars. But direct evidence did eventually filter through. This concerned a brown dwarf\nthat Michael Liu and his colleagues discovered through the infrared adaptive-optics systems\nof the Gemini North and Keck telescopes. What these optic systems disclosed was a brown\ndwarf \u201cglowing faintly\u201d around the \u201cSun-like star\u201d known as 15 Sagittae.8\u2019 If nothing else,\nthis takes care of the objection that the sub-brown dwarf that was proto-Saturn had no busi-\nness residing, or settling, within the Solar System. Moreover, in comparison to our Solar\nSystem, the proximity of the brown dwarf in question to 15 Sagittae, \u201cas little as 14 astro-\nnomical units,\u201d would have positioned it \u201cbetween Saturn and Uranus,\u201d\u00ae not far from the\nvery locality in which proto-Saturn itself finally settled.\n\nWhat is also interesting is that, according to Liu, this brown dwarf \u201cis too massive to\nhave formed within a circumstellar disk like a planet.\u201d8\u00b0 While expressing his belief that\n\u201cthere are a diversity of physical processes that act to populate the outer regions of exoplanet\nsystems,\u201d\u00ae Liu did not venture to say by what possible procedure such a dwarf could have\nbeen formed. Bo Reipurth, on the other hand, has proposed that \u201cbrown dwarfs begin their\nlives as protostellar \u2018embryos\u2019 just like ordinary stars\u2014but are gravitationally ejected from\ntheir parent gas clouds before they have time to grow.\u201d\n\nBut what of the planets in our own Solar System? Planetary ejection had been proposed\nby orthodox astronomers long before the discovery of extra-solar planets. But this was an\nentirely different mode of ejection in which small planets were theorized to have been ejected\nby larger ones. In 1989, V. N. Zharkov and A. V. Kozenko revived this theory by again pro-\nposing that Jupiter must have ejected an \u201cembryo\u201d which then initiated the formation of Sat-\nurn, with further ejected \u201cembryos\u201d forming the planets Uranus and Neptune.\u201d In 1993,\nwhile questioning the very process of what he termed \u201cthe often-invoked idea that planets all\ncondensed from a collapsed cloud of material in orbit around the Sun,\u201d Thomas Van\nFlandern proposed that cosmic bodies are emitted by a fast rotating parent.

Moreover,\nthese emissions are initially jettisoned out in opposite and aligned directions, before being\nscattered in equatorial planes.% In fact, as we have seen, astrophysicists began speaking of\nplanets \u201cbirthing punier planets\u201d purely as a matter of fact.% If nothing else, this demon-\nstrates that alternative theories claiming that the Solar System planets have been ejected from\nother planets, so much ridiculed when proposed by Immanuel Velikovsky in 1950, have\nmore than once been proposed by academia.\n\nThe planetary ejection models developed by those mentioned above differ from each\nother, as they also differ from the one propounded in this work. Here we follow what is being\ndiscovered in our immediate spatial neighborhood, which continues to lend credibility to all\nthose who have been stressing the plasma and electric nature of the Universe. In this respect,\nHalton Arp had the following to offer:\n\n\u201cThe assumption in cosmogony until now has been that all bodies in the universe\ncondensed out of a uniformly spread, homogeneous medium and hierarchically ag-\ngregated to their current sizes. The evidence, however, is that proto-bodies are ejected\nfrom previously existing parent bodies and subsequently grow to their presently ob-\nserved sizes. We have seen this strongly in the formation of galaxies, quasars and\ncluster galaxies and quasars...We are seeing it now in the formation of planets.\u201d95\n\nBut bear with me a wee longer while we back-track a little and I promise that, by the end\nof this last chapter, we will have managed to drive our ultimate peg into its hole.\n\nASTRAL EJECTIONS\n\nLet us move far out in space into the dominion of galaxies. How are galaxies formed?\nThe theory that new galaxies are formed by ejection from older galaxies harks back to 1957\nas adduced by Viktor Ambarzumian,\u00ae who has long been regarded as a hero of science in his\nnative Armenia. This theory has also been one of the mainstays of Halton Arp\u2019s career.\nMeanwhile, Hannes Alfv\u00e9n had for long suggested that plasma filaments, which have since\nbeen detected in space in quantum sufficit, are responsible for the formation of galaxies. An-\nthony Peratt, a former student of Alfv\u00e9n who later acted as his secretariat, and who has since\nbecome a renowned plasma physicist presently working at Los Alamos National Laboratory,\ndecided to test Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s hypothesis. What Peratt discovered in the laboratory is that \u201cplasma\nfilaments tend to twist up into what look like tiny spiral galaxies.\u201d Through computer simu-\nlation, he then scaled the action up to galactic size. Starting with two parallel filaments that\nare drawn together by their magnetic fields, and followed by what Eric Lerner called \u201ca pro-\nlonged mating dance,\u201d the filaments merged into a single structure that correctly mimicked a\nbona fide spiral galaxy. Some of these simulations even produced the poleward jets seen\nemanating from real-life galaxies.\u201d\n\nAs Lerner noted, computer simulations are one thing, the real Universe is quite another. It\nwas, however, not long after Peratt had published his results that, in 1984, real filaments,\nmore than a hundred light-years long, were observed at the centre of our own galaxy, the\nMilky Way.
