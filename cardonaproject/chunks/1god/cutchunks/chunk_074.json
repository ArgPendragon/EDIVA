    "content": "\ncalled for Mars as the boreal planet, the mechanics of a Rankine vortex could just as easily be\napplied to our Saturnian model. As Jueneman explained it, a Rankine vortex consists of\n\u201cnested cylinders of atmospheric gases and debris, one within another, each separated by\ndensity gradients caused by pressure, thermal, and perhaps electrical differentials.\u201d\u00ae But what\nwould have been the cause of such a planetary vortex?\nAs explained in a previous chapter, proto-Saturn\u2019s proximity would have raised a litho-\nspheric bulge in Earth\u2019s northern region, the shadow of which exists to this day. But, too, as\nthere explained, Earth\u2019s hydrosphere and atmosphere would also have responded to proto-\nSaturn\u2019s attractive force. As Jueneman clarified, this gravitational force would have been en-\nhanced by the inertia inherent in the synchronous rotation of the planetary pair. Thus the\ngentle westerly winds of lower latitudes \u201cwould have turned into increasingly violent south-\nwesterly gales\u201d at higher ones. In their northward spiral, aided by coriolis effects, these hur-\nricane winds would then have towered above Earth\u2019s north polar region.\u00ae\n\u201cThe tremendous energy of forward motion in the air mass, imparted by the relatively\nclose proximity of the northern celestial body, would have been converted into angu-\nlar momentum, increasing the velocity of this atmospheric maelstrom as it continued\nto accelerate into a tighter and tighter spiral. Finally, it would have sent a towering\ntornado-like polar column beyond the upper atmosphere and deep into space, ever\nreaching toward the northern body and forming a gaseous bridge in an attempt to span\nthe void between.\u201d!\u00b0\nThe beauty of this model is that, unlike Talbott\u2019s flow of debris and Rose\u2019s flux tube, it\nreadily explains the whirlwind motion attributed to the mythological axis mundi. But does it\nlend itself to a ray of light shining from above? After all, as we all know, tornadoes are any-\nthing but luminescent. They are, on the contrary, often very dark in appearance, some of\nthem close to black, and definitely opaque enough to mask their internal lightning displays.\nAnd yet, external luminosities have been known to accompany tornadoes such as that which\nroared through St. Louis in 1959. This was described by various witnesses as having been of\n\u201ca continuous illumination,\u201d \u201ca flame-like flare right up from the horizon,\u201d and of \u201cthe shape\nof a broad sword.\u201d!! Others have been described as having a \u201cbeautiful electric blue light\u201d\naround them, or of looking \u201clike a searchlight beam\u201d extending down to the skyline.!?\nJueneman himself attributes various electrical and light activity occurring within his\nplanetary vortex'3 but, as he described it, much like the tornado mentioned above, the overall\nappearance of the planetary vortex would have been a \u201cbluish color\u201d of \u201cexquisite bril-\nliance...encased in a pale green envelope.\u201d '4 Granted that some of these effects stem from\nJueneman\u2019s objective perceptivity, it is difficult to judge how much of them might also be\ndue to his fertile speculation.\nFor years I had accepted Jueneman\u2019s model as being a tentative valid prototype of the\nmythological polar column. Then, as the years went by, my interest shifted to the discovery",

    "content": "\nBut can an electric discharge be sustained? Apparently so. Thus, for instance, in 1991,\nAndrew Gray discovered a bright strand, 150 light years long and a couple wide, near the\ncentre of the Milky Way. Dubbed \u201cthe Snake,\u201d it is similar to other so-called \u201cthreads\u201d which\nhave been discovered within the barrel-shaped region of space known as the Galactic Centre\nLobe. Gray himself is of the opinion that the Snake \u201cis an electrical discharge, like a vast\nlightning bolt\u2014so vast that it just hangs in space, instead of disappearing as earthly lightning\ndoes.\u201d20\nMeanwhile, the \u201ccorkscrew motion\u201d of the jet, as mentioned above, originates from the\nplasma\u2019s discharge system. As Thornhill succinctly explained:\n\u201c...plasma is highly structured, allowing electric currents to flow through it along\nmagnetic field lines in the form of filaments, themselves twisted into ropes. Such\ntwisted filaments are seen in the powerful jets issuing from the cores of active galax-\nies, the tornadic clouds in the Lagoon nebula, the giant prominences streaming from\nthe sun, comet tails, etc.\u201d2!\nMoreover, these twisted filaments are not static, but highly active vortices,?? thus ac-\ncounting for the whirlwind motion endemic in the mythological axis mundi, But then,\nharking back to astral jets, is it known that these rotate? They surely do. Thus, for in-\nstance, data received from the Ulysses spacecraft showed that the twisting field lines\nconnected to both poles of the Sun rotate with it. As Thornhill stated: \u201cAstral jets are a\nmore active and visible manifestation of the same Birkeland currents.\u201d?3 This, of course,\nhad already been ascertained by others, including Eric Lerner, who described such a jet as\n\u201ca plasma-pinching vortex filament.\u201d4 As he explained:\n\u201cThe vortices are produced by a phenomenon known as the pinch effect. A straight\nthread of electric current flowing through a plasma surrounds itself with a cylindrical\nmagnetic field. This field attracts other currents flowing in the same direction. Thus\nthe tiny current threads tend to \u2018pinch\u2019 together, drawing the plasma with them. The\nconverging threads are twined into a plasma rope, much as water converging toward a\ndrain generates a swirling vortex.\u201d 25\nAs indicated by the diagram on the previous page, a Birkeland current has the appearance\nof two serpents twisted about each other. And was not Boreas originally said to have\npossessed serpent tails for feet? (Even so, it should be noted that the serpentine structure of\nthe axis mundi was not always visibly apparent, concerning which much more will be di-\nvulged in a future volume.)?6\nTaking his cue from Thornhill, Talbott, too, latched on to the polar jet theory. Thus, in an\ninterview conducted by AEON, he spoke of the \u201cgalactic scale plasma model\u201d which carried",

    "content": "\n\u201cthe potential for a jetting of material\u201d along the axis of a plasma discharge.?\u2019 To which he\nadded:\n\u201cThis streaming of gases along the axis of rotation has, for 25 years, been part of the\nbedrock of the Saturn theory.\u201d?8\nNow while, as we have seen, it is true that the interpretation of the polar column as a\nstream of debris, now clarified as streaming gases, was part and parcel of Talbott\u2019s particular\nmodel since its inception, the interpretation of the same phenomenon as a plasma jet or dis-\ncharge was entirely new. Here it is more than evident that, while willing to accept cosmic\nplasma jets as scaled-up versions of proto-Saturn\u2019s boreal column, Talbott was not ready to\nrelinquish his original idea, and thus sought to amalgamate the two. Thornhill himself was\nnot exactly hostile to this unification. Thus, when questioned about Talbott\u2019s interpretation of\nthe polar column as a stream of fiery debris ejected toward Earth, he replied with these\nwords:\n\u201cT think that for most of the time [the polar column] would have been like a spec-\ntacular auroral effect with very little matter transfer taking place. It is only when it\ntransformed suddenly from a glow discharge to an arc that substantial matter would\nhave been transferred between bodies.\u201d??\nBut can a Birkeland current transfer matter between bodies? Apparently so. As Thornhill\nexplained:\n\u201cTo begin with, a rotating Birkeland current will form a tornado in an atmos-\nphere...Secondly, Eric Crew back in the 80s discussed how lightning usually acceler-\nates positive ions vertically, creating a jet of hot moist air at the top of the discharge\nchannel. In general terms the discharge compresses, heats and accelerates gases from a\nregion of high pressure to a region of lower pressure. So bulk matter is moved by an\nelectric discharge..\u201d3\u00b0\nThe tornadic quality of this sustained Birkeland current thus compensates for the loss of\nJueneman\u2019s Rankine vortex model.\nOr does it have to? After all, with the tidal heaping of the terrestrial atmosphere due to\nproto-Saturn\u2019s proximity combined with its inevitable spiraling motion, the effects proposed\nby Jueneman should have taken place. Even the twisting of the axis can be accounted for\nthrough the workings of a Rankine vortex. Just as terrestrial tornadoes \u201coccasionally exhibit\nsmaller counter-rotating vortices in close proximity to the primary whirlwind,\u201d so \u201con a\nmuch vaster scale, similar counter-rotating catenulate bolus flows would have snaked around\nthe polar column in filamentary fashion.\u201d3! Could it not, therefore, have been that both\ncauses, a planetary Rankine vortex and a sustained Birkeland current, have joined forces in\nproducing the most colossal tornado Earth has ever experienced? Or would the electrical\nforce inherent in a Birkeland current have overpowered the Rankine effect?",
