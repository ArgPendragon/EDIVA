    "content": "Jerusalem, but also as B\u00e9t (or Bit) Sulman.\u201d48 The designation \u201cHouse\u201d \u2014i.e. B\u00e9t(h)\u2014for\ncities in Palestine is, of course, quite common. Easily coming to mind are such cities as Beth-\naven, Beth-El, Bethlehem, Beth-haran, Bethshemesh, Beth-horon, Beth-eden (in Syria),\nBeth-peor, Beth-shan, and many others. Lewy himself explains such place names as due to\nthe one-time existence of sanctuaries each of which was dedicated to the deity there named.*9\nThus, Jerusalem would have been referred to as Beth Shulman because a temple of Shulman\nwould have existed there.\n\nLewy\u2019s conclusion was that a temple of Shulman supplanted an earlier one dedicated to\nShalim but that it did not last for long. During the same period, the name of the city changed\nfrom Urusalim to Bet Shulman; but, with the destruction of the Shulman temple, the name of\nthe city reverted back to Urusalim. This would explain why the name Bet Shulman never be-\ncame popular.\u00b0\u00b0\n\nNeedless to say, this was all conjecture on Lewy\u2019s part. For one thing, Lewy himself ac-\ncepted that Shalim and Shulman(u) were slightly different versions of the same deity,>! so\nthat no replacement of sanctuaries need enter the picture. Nor need the name Bet Shulman\nhave ever supplanted that of Urusalim since, in effect, the meaning of both names is theolog-\nically, even if not philologically, synonymous\u2014the former meaning \u201cHouse of Shulman,\u201d\nthe latter, as we have seen, \u201cFounded by Shalim.\u201d>? It is thus more than possible that Bet\nShulman was merely another designation for Urusalim, the one derived from Assyrian,\nthe other from Chaldean sources. The Chaldean name passed into Hebrew; the Assyrian did\nnot. The one became popular; the other not.\n\nIn any case, whether called by the very name of the god (Salem); referred to as having\nbeen founded by him (Urusalim/Yerushalem); or simply called his city (Bet Shulman); it re-\nmains obvious that the city we call Jerusalem was named in honor and dedicated to the god\nShalem/Shulman.3\n\nIndications that this god was worshipped there can be traced at least to the time of Israel\u2019s\n\nUnited Monarchy.* Also rendered Shulman or Shulmanu,\u00b0> this god\u2019s name gave Jedidiah,\nson of David and king of Israel, his more popular name of Solomon.* Rendered Shlomoh in\nHebrew, this monarch\u2019s name has also been stated to have been derived from shalom, which,\nas everyone knows, does, inter alia, mean \u201cpeace.\u201d (Compare also the Arabic salam and\nMaltese sliema.) The probability, however, is that both the monarch\u2019s name and the word for\n\u201cpeace\u201d derived from the name of the god. As Roy Rosenberg tells us, Stomoh (Shlomoh)\nmeans \u201cbelonging to Salim\u201d57\n\nBiblical theophoric names derived from Shalem are common including the names of\nkings of Israel and Judah. Among such names we find: Shallum, Shelemiah, Shelomi, Shel-\nemi (or Shulamit), after whom Immanuel Velikovsky named one of his daughters, and\n\nelemoth.",

    "content": "\nOutside of the Old Testament, we find this theophoric name adopted by Shalamanu, King\nof Moab.\u00b0S It also appears in the name of Shalmaneser, a name borne by more than one As-\nsyrian king. Perhaps less known is the fact that Salummati was an epithet of the great Assur-\nnasirpal.5?\nAs a god, Shulman was worshipped in Nineveh and, under the variant Shulmanuha or\nShulmanuhi, is found mentioned in Assyrian tablets.\u00a9\nShulman is known to have had a feimine counterpart named ShulmanituS!\u2014but also\nShala.\u00ae This goddess\u2014but not Shulman \u2014has been identified with Astarte and Ishtar, both\npersonifications of the planet Venus. Moreover, Assyrian sources define Sulmanitu (the same\nas Shulmanitu) as distar Urusilimma which Michael Astour has rendered \u201cIStar of Jerusa-\nlem.\u201d That this goddess was known in Jerusalem is verified by her laudation in the famous\nSong of Solomon in which she is referred to merely as the Shulammite.\u00ae5\nThe sacrifices performed in Solomon\u2019s temple were referred to in Hebrew as she-\nlamim\u2014the plural of shelem. Usually translated as \u201cpeace offering(s),\u201d R. de Vaux is of a\ndifferent opinion in that shelamim \u201cimplies the idea of a tribute offered to God...\u201d\u00ae If this is\ncorrect, the god in question must originally have been Shalem.\nAs they appear in cuneiform, the words salummatu and salummati are usually thought to\nsignify \u201cbrightness\u201d and \u201csplendor\u201d respectively.\u201d As epithets, these descriptive terms were\napplied to Enlil (Saturn), Nergal (Mars), and Nabu (Mercury). On their own, they throw no\nlight on the real identity of Shalem. Who, then, was this god?\nVery much like other names of Saturn, Shalem (or Salim) meant \u201cthe Stable One.\u201d\u00a9\nSolomon\u2019s name, \u201cbelonging to Salim,\u201d can then be translated as \u201cbelonging to Saturn.\u201d\nDavid, his father, must have been very partial to the Saturnian deity for not only did he name\nSolomon in his honor, but also his first-born son, \"Amnon, which means \u201cbelonging to\n*Amin\u2014i.e. the Stable One,\u201d and even his third, AbSalom, which means \u201cthe Father is\nSalim.\u201d It can now safely be said that Jerusalem was the City of Saturn, a conclusion that\nwas additionally reached by Lewis Greenberg.7! (And did not Isaiah himself refer to\nJerusalem as the city of justice,\u201d2 which justice, in Akkadian kittum, we have already\nfound to be an epithet of Shamash/Saturn?)

In two of these letters which Egyptologists\nhave numbered 74 and 290, reference is made to a place which transliterators have rendered\ndifferently. In 1915, J. Knudtzon settled on the reading of this place as Bet Ninib\u201d\u2014i.e.,\nHouse of Ninib.\nSome time later, in 1940, Julius Lewy re-read the name of this place as Bit Shul-\nmanu\u2014House (or Sanctuary) of Shulman.\u201d\nWilliam Albright did not accept Lewy\u2019s transliteration, claiming that the ideogram which\nhe read as \u201cShulmanu\u201d did not incorporate the determinative for divinity.\u201d\nIn 1969, the team of Tadmor and Kalai re-read the ideogram again, this time as Beth Nin-\nurta.\nWhich, then, was the correct reading?\nThis problem has given birth to many a debate,\u201d but it should never have done so. Let me\nsay that Knudtzon was perfectly correct in reading the name as Bet Ninib since the cuneiform\nideogram which \u201cspells\u201d the name of the god in question is \u201cNIN.IB. Of that, there never was\nany doubt.\" As pointed out in an earlier chapter of this work, Ninib, sometimes rendered\nNinip and/or Nirig, was the planetary god Saturn.\u201d\nThe reason behind Lewy\u2019s re-reading of the name as Shulman may not appear clear to the\nuninitiated. Suffice it to say that cuneiform characters can be read ideographically and/or\nphonetically. Thus the ideogram \u201cNIN.IB can also be read \u201cNinurta\u00ae\u2014which means that",

    "content": "Tadmor and Kalai\u2019s reading of the place in question as Beth Ninurta was also correct. As we\nhave already documented, Ninurta was also one of the names by which the planet Saturn was\nknown.\n\nLewy\u2019s re-reading, meanwhile, was based on an equation which is to be found in an\nAssyrian explanatory list of divine names. In this list, the Assyrians themselves equated\n\u00a2NIN.IB with \u201cDI.MES. Just as \u2018NIN.IB can be read as \u2018Ninurta, so also can \u201cDI.MES be\nread as \u201cShulmanu.\u00ae It therefore follows that, like Ninib/Ninurta, with whom he was\nequated, Shulman was simply an alias of the planetary god Saturn.\n\nFrom this it can be seen that all three readings\u2014Bet Ninib, Beth Ninurta, and Bit Shul-\nmanu\u2014are correct. They all mean the same thing: \u201cHouse (or Sanctuary) of Saturn.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Albright was entirely wrong when he claimed that the name Shulman\ndid not incorporate the determinative for divinity. The name Shulman, as it appears in el-\nAmarna letter 290, does incorporate the determinative \u2014dingir\u2014for divinity. Lewy repro-\nduced it by the usual transliteration\u2014 viz., \u201cSulmani.\u201d\u2122\n\nThe equation of Shulman with Ninurta/Saturn, as revealed in the above, is of additional\nimportance to the subject of this chapter because, very much like Shulman/Shalem, Ninurta\nwas also considered an immobile god. Thus, in Akkadian, Ninurta was styled kaimanu, that\nis \u201cthe steady star.\u201d\u201d\n\n(For those in the know: The association of Shulman with Resheph, like that of Ninurta\nwith Nergal, will be discussed in a future work.)\n\nTHE MESOPOTAMIAN EVIDENCE\n\nWhile we have already seen that one of the Assyro-Babylonian names for the planet Sat-\nurn was (Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-US, we have so far refrained from saying what the name stood\nfor. Simply put, Lu-Bat Sag-U\u00a7 means \u201cthe steady planet.\u201d The term \u201csteady planet\u201d is not\nmuch different than the term \u201cstable planet,\u201d so that we can see that this characteristic of the\nSaturnian deity was by no means a rarity.\n\nIn keeping with this topic, we also find that Shamash/Saturn was said to have occupied\n\u201cthe house of rest.\u201d\u00ae Here there is no intimation of slow movement. A deity who occupies a\nhouse of rest must himself be at rest.\n\nWhen speaking of the Sumerian god Ea, Berossus, writing in Greek, used the name Kro-\nnos\u201d who was Saturn. And did we not, in Chapter 6, see Ea identified precisely as that very\nsame planet?\n\nThe Babylonian name of Ea was Enki.\u201d In fact, Ea was actually written with the ideo-\ngram EN.KI. Our interest here lies in the fact that Enki, who must, therefore, also be equated\nwith Saturn, was known as \u201cthe motionless lord\u201d and god of \u201cstability.\u201d\u201d As the god of sta-\nbility, Enki compares favorably with Saturn\u2019s epithet as the Stable One.
