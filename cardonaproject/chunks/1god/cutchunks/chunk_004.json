As Sharon Begley ef al noted:\n\u201cBefore there is knowledge, there must be memory. Yet few subjects remain so\nunknown, so obscured in metaphor and myth.

I sit\nin the pupil of the Eye.\u201d*\nNow I ask you, what meaning can be extracted from the above? As the \u201clord of the\ncrown,\u201d the deity can be understood as the crowned god. Thus he can say that his seat is on\nhis throne. There is nothing enigmatic about a crowned god sitting on his throne. But what\ndoes it mean that the deity is, or resides, \u201cin the Eye\u201d or that he sits \u201cin the pupil of the Eye\u201d?\nWhat is this \u201cEye\u201d in which the god resides? And why is the eye equated with his egg? What\nhas an eye to do with an egg? What is this egg anyway?\nAnd yet, enigmatic as these words are, together with others pertaining to different themes,\nan in-depth study will reveal their coherence and even logic once the key to the symbolism\nbehind them is understood.\nMISTRANSLATIONS\nOnce myths were put into writing, mistranslations were bound to occur. Here, an illustra-\ntion offered by Bob Forrest comes immediately to mind.\n\u201cI can imagine how odd anomalies could arise in transmission, and this point was\nbrought home to me by a curious example I came across just recently: Cinderella\u2019s\nglass slipper. I had always found it peculiar that the slipper should be said to be made\nof glass, but according to Brewer\u2019s \u2018Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\u2019 this came about\nvia a mistranslation of the phrase \u2018pantoufle en vair\u2019 (a fur slipper) as \u2018a glass slipper\u2019\n(pantoufle en verre). I do not suppose, though, that the vagaries of oral transmission\ncan account for more than the odd \u2018peculiarity\u2019 of a myth, legend or story.\u201d\u00ae\nAnother example concerns one of the most famous sayings attributed to Jesus: \u201cIt is eas-\nier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the king-\ndom of God.\u201d\u201d As Vitaliano indicated, this is more than probably a mistranslation of the\nGreek, in which the Gospels were originally written, where the Greek word for\n\u201crope\u201d \u2014 kameylos \u2014was mistranslated as \u201ccamel\u201d \u2014 kamelos. \u201d This is because the sound of\nthe Greek letter efa sounds very similar to that of epsilon to a foreign ear. Thus the words of\nJesus should be translated as: \u201cIt is easier for a rope to go through the eye of a needle, than\nfor a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God\u201d\u2014which, let\u2019s face it, makes for a better\nsimile.\nWhen it comes to Hebrew, in which the books of the Old Testament were originally set\ndown, we encounter even greater difficulties because, for one thing, Biblical Hebrew was\nwritten without vowels, thus making for confusion between words containing the same con-\nsonants but different vowel sounds, and, for another, there are over a thousand Hebrew words\nwhich appear only in the Old Testament, and, in some cases, appear there only once. How,\nthen, without comparison, can the meaning of such words be verified with certainty?\nAs will be seen in forthcoming pages, such mistranslations, which owe more to the writ-\nten word than they do to oral tradition, permeate the mythological sources of most ancient\nnations. But, rather than proving detrimental to our cause, such mistranslations, where found,\nshall actually help us ferret out the truth.",

    "content": "\nMISINTERPRETATIONS\nThe casual reader of popular mythology may not realize to what extent the subject is in-\nfused with astronomical content. This is partly due to the aversion displayed by most modern\nmythologists to anything in their studies that smacks of astronomical connections. This is so\ntrue that when Girogio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend dared to go against the com-\nmon trend in their monumental work, Hamlet\u2019s Mill, they found the doors of academia closed\nshut in their face. As Martin Bernal found reason to state:\n\u201cHaving written a major book on Galileo, de Santillana [whom Bernal qualifies as\npossibly the greatest historian of Renaissance science] became interested in the Her-\nmetic Egyptian tradition; then, late in life, he read Dupuis\u2019s Origine de tous les cultes,\nand was convinced by its argument that much of ancient mythology was indeed alle-\ngory for scientific astronomy.\n\u201cDespite de Santillana\u2019s enormous reputation, Hamlet\u2019s Mill\u2014the book in which he\nand a younger German colleague [Hertha von Dechend] set out [such a mytho-astro-\nnomical] scheme\u2014was not accepted by any university press and was published com-\nmercially. This means that respectable scholars are not obliged to take such work into\naccount. In addition, de Santillana\u2019s having stuck his neck out so far lessened his ef-\nfectiveness as a [historian]. Furthermore, his work ... could be lumped together with\na more or less \u2018lunatic fringe\u2019; this allowed or even compelled orthodox scholars to\nignore it.\u201d\u201d\nEarlier in this century, mythologists were quite aware of the astronomical nature of an-\ncient myths, but, of lately, the general assumption has been that these astral connections are\nof late derivation, having been foisted on an already existing mythology. So much can be\nsaid against this that volumes, of which this is one, can be written.\nThe problem, however, goes deeper than that because even those earlier mythologists\nwho had accepted the astronomical nature of the myths were themselves often guilty of tam-\npering with their sources so that, today, it is not easy to discern what these ancient sources\nreally had to say about the cosmic powers our ancestors venerated. This is not to be\nwondered at because, if one had to pursue the astronomical motifs inherent in most of\nmythology, one would be forced to assume that the ancients\u2019 perception of the celestial\nsphere was entirely different from that of modern man. Thus, when modern mythologists\npursue these astral myths, they tend to look up at the sky, if only figuratively, and realize that\nwhat the ancient records state about the planets, and even the Sun and Moon, bears\nabsolutely no resemblance to the present Solar System. And yet one must keep in mind that\nthese self-same ancients, as we shall see in the next chapter, were quite sophisticated when it\ncame to observational astronomy. Thus something of a dilemma faces the mythologist as was\npoignantly demonstrated, a few decades ago, by Irene Nicholson.\nIn a Mayan scheme purported to describe the celestial sphere, Nicholson discovered that\nthe planet Venus was positioned above the Sun, below which was the Milky Way and, below\nthat, the Moon.\u201d Knowing full well that the Maya had been better astronomers than that, she\nattempted to circumvent the problem by blaming these disparities on a faulty record.",
