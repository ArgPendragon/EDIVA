It must be\nvisible in the same form to people scattered over wide areas of North America and\nEurasia. | therefore propose a hologrammatic phenomenon of polarization of light of\nstratospheric particles which is manifested only at certain points in a series of inten-\nsities of solar radiation at harmonically related electromagnetic frequencies.\n\u201cAt an appropriate intensity, the radiation at various frequencies is in a proper mutual\nrelationship, and the hologram is brilliantly lighted. It is seen in essentially the same\nform from points of viewing thousands of kilometres apart. It appears to be in the ro-\ntational polar space. It constitutes the central feature of the sky. The complete visual\nassemblage of it is that lost ancient sky which was radically different from what we\nnow associate with the sky.\u201d5\u00b0\nIn order to circumvent the problem raised by the invisibility of this hologrammatic appa-\nrition in the present sky, Ashton proposed that \u201cbetween the activating intensities of solar ra-\ndiation, there is an interference phenomenon which [now] blots out the polar apparition.\u201d5\u201d\nHe even provided \u201ca hypothetical instance of how this might work\u201d*8 but, as he made clear in\n1999, the entire exercise becomes irrelevant since he himself eventually disavowed it all. As\nhe then wrote: \u201cIn \u2018The Bedrock of Myth,\u2019 as yet unpublished, I explain why, by content of\nmyth alone, I reject the role of planets in the Polar Assemblage, which I think may well have\nbeen objective, but for which I failed to propose a plausible model.\u201d\u00b0\u00b0\nOne should recommend Ashton for his honesty but, since he continues to believe that\nwhat he terms the Polar Assemblage was the very bedrock of myth, and since he now admits\nthat the hologrammatic model he had previously advanced cannot be considered plausible,\nwhat is he left with to explain the apparition he continues to believe in?\nKnowing Ashton for the intelligent man he is, it remains my personal opinion that he\njumped off the planetary Saturnian ship a little too hastily and much too early.\nAll of the above attempts, noble efforts one and all, suffered through similar problems\nand, in one respect, by one and the same difficulty. All of them, in one way or another, were\nburdened with items which are contrary to what the mytho-historical records demands,\nand/or with items which, at best, are not contained within that record. To be fair to all con-\ncerned, most of those who had thus far attempted to solve the axial problem inherent in the\nSaturnian configuration were in something of a peculiar situation in that the Saturnian sce-\nnario had not yet been gathered together in chronological sequence in any one place. Worse\nthan that, not all of the events, with their celestial interactions, and their consequential out-\ncomes, had till then received treatment. Nor can the present work alleviate that problem be-\ncause, while a chronology of sorts is here being attempted, the history of the Saturnian sys-\ntem contains too many constituents, and too many events, only a few of which have so far\nbeen touched upon, to be told in one short volume. Add to all that the additional problem the\nabove theoreticians encountered in that they were already faced with slight disagreements\nbetween the main proponents of the thesis, and one can well understand the shortcomings of\ntheir attempts.\nThe one difficulty with which they all strained, however, was in their location of the Sat-\nurnian configuration within the bounds of the Solar System. This encumbered their theories",

This mass would\nnot have been involved, at least not initially, in our alternative scenario where the co-axial\nSaturnian system would have originally sustained itself far away from the Sun\u2019s gravitational\nand/or electromagnetic influence. And this should not be wondered at because, despite Juer-\ngens\u2019 original concept regarding the extraneousness of the Saturnian system, the theory had\nnot yet received much publicity.\nBesides, as Talbott himself was astute enough to recognize, until all the mythological\nchips are in their correct place, theories concerning the astronomical workings of the Sat-\nurnian system must remain hypothetical at best. As he had it stated:\n\u201cWhat I will argue for is that the search for physical explanations have at its highest\npriority reckoning with the full implications of myth, wherever a definitive consensus\nis indicated. As more information is brought to the discussion this will require a con-\ntinued willingness to reconsider previous speculations\u2014with no qualms about modi-\nSying or even abandoning earlier frameworks .\u201d\u00a9\nTHE LESSON OF SHOEMAKER-LEVY 9\nThe problem then becomes even more obvious because, despite the internal consistency\nof the mytho-historical record, our theory continues to demand an astronomical solution. As\nalready noted, there are no bodies in the present Solar System which are linearly aligned.\nWorse than that, present Solar System theories, based on purely gravitational forces, even\nwith the refinements introduced from lessons learned through the detection of extra-solar\nplanets, do not seem to allow for celestial bodies to be so aligned. But then, in July of 1994,\nComet Shoemaker-Levy 9, which taught us more than one lesson, plowed into Jupiter.\nThe most important message writ large by this impact was more of a warning than any-\nthing else. It taught astronomers, once and for all, that Earth is not the safe haven they had\npreviously believed it to be. If a comet could collide with Jupiter, as this one did, chances of\na similar collision with Earth could not be as far-fetched as once believed. Geologists, of\ncourse, had long recognized the scars left behind by previous terrestrial impacts, but these\nhad always been pushed beyond the reaches of the present into the dim horizon of a long-\ngone past. Until recently, and despite the devastation it caused, even the impact of a fireball\u00ae\nin the valley of the Tunguska River in northern Siberia, in June of 1908, failed to alert as-\ntronomers to the dangers of cosmic impacts. Shoemaker-Levy 9 accomplished what the Tun-\nguska fireball failed to do. It sent entire nations on a world-wide program designed to keep\ntrack of near Earth-grazing objects, such as errant asteroids, in an attempt to forewarn hu-\nmanity of any impending cosmic-induced catastrophe\u2014even though no one seems certain of\nhow to avoid the calamity if and when such a time comes.\nThe second lesson learned from the impact of Shoemaker-Levy 9 had to do with the na-\nture of comets which, for years, had been touted as being mainly composed of ice\u2014\u201cdirty\nsnow-balls,\u201d they have been called, or \u201csnowy dirtballs,\u201d as some jocularly termed them. But\nwhen Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacted on Jupiter, no water was detected.\u00a9? Again, as in the case",

Like Shoemaker-Levy 9, Ida and Dactyl are believed to be fragments of a once single\nlarger asteroid that was shattered by interacting with some other celestial body.\u201d Nor does\nIda seem to be alone in this respect.\nInstead of orbiting around each other, the fragments of Shoemaker-Levy 9 ended up\n\u201cstrung out like pearls,\u201d as one reporter expressed it,7! in a linear configuration that was al-\nmost as straight as an arrow. What this means is that celestial bodies can be linearly lined up,\none \u201cbeneath\u201d the other. If twenty-one individual bodies (the fragments of Shoemaker-Levy\n9) can do so, then so, too, can two of them (in our case, Saturn and Earth)\u2019 despite the dif-\nference in size and mass.\nJust as it was Jupiter\u2019s gravitational pull that was responsible for the fragmentation of the\ncomet, so also was it that same force which \u201cstretched\u201d its fragments into their now-famous\nline-up. It may therefore be objected that Shoemaker-Levy 9\u2019s linear coupling was a fran-\nsient phenomenon. True\u2014but it can no longer be claimed that a linear coupling of celestial\nbodies is physically impossible. Shoemaker-Levy 9 taught us that.\nTHE TRANSITORY SYSTEM\nFrom the very inception of his Saturnian scenario, Talbott had expressed his opinion that,\nlong before Saturn wed Earth in axial coupling, the Saturnian deity was seen to wander in\nspace. As he stated in 1977: \u201cA number of sources suggest that the solitary god wandered for\na time, but eventually came to rest at a stationary point, which is celebrated as the cosmic\ncenter.\u201d73 Later, and elsewhere, he wrote: \u201cIn the primordial epoch the creator first appeared\nin the Abyss, alone, wandering without a resting place.\u201d\u201d4 And: \u201cFor a time the creator wan-\ndered in the luminous sea but eventually came to rest at a point of stability...\u201d75\nIn this scenario, the axial coupling of the two planets would have taken place at the mo-\nment mankind saw their Saturnian deity coming to rest at his stationary celestial point. What,\nthen, would have been Earth\u2019s relation to Saturn during this wandering period?\nAccording to Frederick Hall, while Earth might have always been a satellite of Saturn, it\noriginally orbited the giant planet equatorially but, like the Moon in relation to Earth, the ter-\nrestrial globe would have been phase-locked so that one hemisphere would always have\nfaced its Saturnian primary.\u201d This was identical to Lynn Rose\u2019s model and Talbott, who\ncould not fail to note it, despite the fact that he objected to it, found reason to accept it as a\ntemporary condition of the developing Saturnian system. As he announced:\n\u201cThe simple scheme suggested by Rose may in fact add a vital ingredient to the\nmodel-building process. As noted by Fred Hall...there is terrestrial evidence that the\nEarth was once a satellite of a larger planet, rotating in phase with its revolution. And\nas I have, in turn, stated to Hall in private communication, there is a great deal of\nmythical evidence as well. Mythically, the key is the original state of the old sun god,\nprior to creation. The god, in his earliest remembered state, is \u2018inactive\u2019 or \u2018motion-\nless,\u2019 not in the axial or polar sense, but apparently in the sense of doing nothing,\nlacking activity or animation. This is the state which, in the myths, precedes the god\u2019s",

Though Hall himself would be the first to emphasize the tentative\ncharacter of his speculations, the very fact that they are worth discussing...is at least a\npartial vindication of Rose\u2019s efforts.\u201d7\u201d\nWhile the above is not in keeping with the scenario presented in this work, I do concur\nwith Talbott in that it is worth discussing. More than that, it is worthy of further considera-\ntion despite its disagreement with the alternative concept presented in this work. At this point\none nevertheless wonders why I bother to bring all this up. I do so because Hall\u2019s hypothesis\nled to yet another attempt in explaining how the co-axial system of Saturn and Earth could\nhave been held together in at least a temporary stability. This has to do with Hall\u2019s elucida-\ntion of the transition from Earth\u2019s phase-locked equatorial orbit around Saturn to its later ax-\nial alignment. As Hall explained:\n\u201cNow assume this primordial, dying system enters the alien system of the Sun, even-\ntually encountering the Sun\u2019s largest satellite Jupiter (whose spin axis tilt\u2014or let us\nsay, non tilt\u2014marks it as a primordial companion of the Sun). As a result of this en-\ncounter, or perhaps a series of encounters, Proto-Saturn...is drawn in the direction of\nthe Sun\u2019s equatorial plane which, we shall assume, meant a northerly direction. In ef-\nfect, Proto-Saturn is pulled from the center of its native planetary system by a mas-\nsive force \u2018above\u2019 it, while Proto-Saturn, in turn, pulls [its former satellite, Earth] in\nits wake...\n\u201cUnder this obviously-precarious state, the usual orbital mechanics have suddenly\nbecome irrelevant. What, then, might happen to the Earth?...One of Saturn\u2019s power-\nful magnetic poles is now much closer to Earth and the other more remote. Thus,\nwhile magnetic forces are much weaker than the force of gravity [actually the oppo-\nsite is true\u20198], we have here a classic case in which they can be invoked.\u201d 79\nIn short:\n\u201cEarth is exposed to forces acting as a couple, with the near Saturnian magnetic pole\nattracting one of Earth\u2019s magnetic poles and repelling the other. As a result, the Earth\nis flipped over and is locked into a polar alignment with Saturn .\u201d\u00ae\u00b0\nTalbott\u2019s proposed temporary wandering of Saturn would then have taken place during\nthe transition period between Earth\u2019s phase-locked equatorial orbit around its primeval pri-\nmary and Saturn\u2019s eventual settling in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole due to its axial alignment\nwith the giant. As Talbott himself explained:\n\u201c{After years of research] I concluded that the earliest remembered condition was that\nof phase lock. That was the best explanation for the initial MOTIONLESSNESS or\nINACTIVITY of Atum-Ra, prior to...the wandering of the god as he looked for a",
