    "content": "\nFollowing Juergens, Frederick Hall disclosed similar ideas of his own:\n\u201cMost stars are paired in binary systems. A few are trinities or orbit each other in\ngroups of four or more. Still fewer go it alone. The Sun appears to be a loner. In re-\ncent years it has been postulated that the Sun, after all, may have its partner too,\nwhich would necessarily be a very small star, not seen as yet by astronomers. Neme-\nsis [as this solar companion has been dubbed] is posited to be in an extremely ellipti-\ncal orbit, approaching the Sun every 26 million years...\n\u201cA stronger likelihood, perhaps, is that Nemesis does not exist and will not be found.\nNemesis would now be near its aphelion and, over an incredibly long moment arm,\nshould exert a detectable tug on the Sun. No news is no news. But another possibility\nis also worth considering. If in the past there was a Nemesis and it is no longer out\nthere, it may actually be here. Two stars in a binary system each may have a quota of\nterrestrial bodies and gas giant planets. If their orbital relationship is highly elliptical,\nboth systems could suffer drastic changes at each close approach. The much smaller\nstar would be subject to close encounters with gas giant satellites of the much larger\nstar, involving a possible loss of considerable angular momentum and mass. Hence, it\nis possible that a former Nemesis is now part of our Solar System.\n\u201cIn the event of such a catastrophic event such a \u2018star\u2019 could also lose its ability to\ngenerate stellar amounts of heat and light and could be captured as a close-in gas gi-\nant satellite of the larger star...If it is ultimately decided that Earth did arrive into the\nSolar System as a satellite of a Nemesis-like sun/planet\u2014perhaps Jupiter or Sat-\nurn\u2014then numerous geological mysteries would be cleared up and man\u2019s early pre-\noccupation with planetary worship would be much easier to understand.\u201d !2\nEven more recently, the invasion of the Solar system by the Saturnian one, including\nEarth, has been taken up and expounded further by Wallace Thornhill. 3\nAstronomers have not yet postulated that Earth may have originated outside our Sun\u2019s\ndomain. But, in view of their recently revised history of the Solar Systems, as will be\noutlined below, even they are now asking whether Earth has always been where it is now.14\nSo where could it have been?\nEXTRA-SOLAR PLANETS\nWhen, in the 1980s, Carl Sagan aired his belief, earlier adhered to by Giordano Bruno,\nthat the universe is filled with planets orbiting stars other than our own Sun, he was laughed\nout of court. As Kathy Svitil reported, unlike Bruno, Sagan \u201cwas spared the stake, but not the\nsmug laughter of some of his fellow astronomers\u201d who were quick to point out that \u201cno\nplanet had yet been found in any galaxy beyond our own solar system.\u201d !5",

    "content": "\nMaybe not in a different galaxy but, as early as 1967, Axel Firsoff had already been\nwriting about the discovery of extra-solar planets as if they were in the realm of general\nknowledge. Thus, in explaining what he termed \u201cthe general plan of planetary systems,\u201d he\nalready could refer to \u201csuper [JJovian planets, which are known to accompany some stars.\u201d !\nDespite more recent reports to the contrary, the first of these extra-solar planets was dis-\ncovered by D. Reuyl in 1936. With an estimated mass of 0.04 M, and an orbital period of 15\nyears, it was detected near the star known as Ross 614.17\nAnother planet already known to Firsoff is one \u201ca little less than twice as massive as Ju-\npiter,\u201d which orbits Proxima Centauri, 4.3 light years away. '8\nThese planets, it should be pointed out, are detected rather than observed. Stars which are\naccompanied by planets go through periodic wobbles which are ascertained through the\nDoppler shifts in their spectral lines, due to the attraction of their invisible attendants. The\namount of wobble allows the accompanying planet\u2019s mass and orbit to be calculated.\nAs Firsoff reported:\n\u201cSeveral other stars are known to have dark companions, but these are rather more\nmassive than Proxima\u2019s big planet. Such superplanets may be partly degenerate, with\ninteriors in superdense conditions encountered in White Dwarfs, and so could be\nquite small, despite their great masses.\u201d!9\nAnother body, which Firsoff referred to as \u201ca dark companion of about 10 times the mass\nof Jupiter,\u201d was also detected orbiting the red dwarf star Lalande 21185, which is calculated\nto be 8.1 (or 8.25 as newer sources have it) light years away and said to have a mass of 0.4\nM. As Firsoff adds: \u201cThis discovery was due to the exceptionally large proper motion of the\nstar, which changes its position in the sky by 4.8\" a year and, for this reason, was being\nclosely followed.\u201d 2\u00b0\nFirsoff did not enumerate the discoveries and identities of the extra-solar planets known\nin 1967 one by one, but he did state that \u201cnearly 10 superplanets are now known to be at-\ntached to the nearest stars.\u201d2! Thus, even then, Firsoff could claim that:\n\u201cFar from being exceptional, the Solar System is rather a humdrum example of\nplanetary configurations. There are multiple stars, each with an array of planets of its\nown; close binaries sharing one or more planets; superplanets that may have planetary\nsatellites, which may in turn be accompanied by moons.\u201d22\nAstronomers are not always honest. Take, for instance, the planet supposedly discovered\nby Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz in orbit around the star 51 Pegasi at a distance of 50\nlight years. More recently touted as the first such planet detected, Sam Flamsteed even spoke",

What, then, of the 10 extra-solar\n\nplanets that were already known by 1967, the first of which was discovered in 1936?\nSo, similarly, with the planet\u2014or, at least, a brown dwarf star\u2014said to orbit Proxima\nCentauri, which has recently been said to have first been discovered in 1998 through the\nHubble Space Telescope.24 How, then, could Firsoff have written about it in 1967?\nBut then, David Golimowski and Dan Schroeder nixed the whole thing. More sensitive\nobservations led these two observers to conclude that no evidence really existed for such \u201ca\nbrown dwarf or planet companion.\u201d As Golimowski stated:\n\u201cWe have images of Proxima that definitely should have revealed something. They\ndid not.\u201d25\nEven so, as of this writing, planets in extra-solar systems are being detected almost every\nmonth. These assemblages, however, bear little resemblance to our own Solar System. Cal-\nculated to be half the mass of Jupiter, the 51 Pegasi planet orbits its primary at a mere dis-\ntance of 5 million miles, which is seven times closer than tiny Mercury orbits our Sun. The\nplanet completes its orbit in a mere 4.2 days.26\n\u201cTo appreciate how bizarre this behavior is,\u201d writes Flamsteed, \u201cit helps to consider\nthe bigger planets in our solar system\u2014Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They\nare all at least a hundred times farther from the sun than 51 Peg[asi]\u2019s planet appears\nto be. And it takes them years\u2014a full dozen years, in the case of Jupiter\u2014to make a\nsingle orbit.\u201d27\nWhat, then, of the belief that giant gas planets can only form somewhere in the middle of\nthe revolving cloud of collapsing interstellar gas and dust that goes into forming a solar sys-\ntem? By the 1990s, astronomers had to ask: \u201cHow could a giant planet form so close to a star\nwithout being sucked in by gravity?\u201d8\nActually Doug Lin had already suggested that planets like Jupiter could migrate from an\nouter system in toward their parent star. Lin\u2019s hypothesis, however, did not envisage such\ngiant planets ever coming to a halt close to their primary. His theory demanded that such\nplanets would eventually be swallowed up by their sun. But, in view of newer discoveries,\nLin and fellow astronomers were soon writing in Nature with two different scenarios aimed\nat getting a Jupiter-sized planet to stop short of being swallowed up.29\nAnd then\u2014the see-saw of scientific opinion\u2014David Gray announced that the posited\nplanet around 51 Pegasi was not really there at all.3\u00b0 Most astronomers, however, have disre-\ngarded his conclusion, and the posited planet has now become fact.\nIn the twelve months following this discovery and its attempted debunking, six other ex-\ntra-solar planets were announced as having been detected. Three of them were said to be Ju-\npiter-sized bodies orbiting \u201cabsurdly close\u201d to their primaries. Two others were found to orbit",

As\nFred Rasio had to admit, \u201cyou get the impression that most solar systems are not like ours.\u201d32\n\nAnother planet was discovered orbiting the star Tau Bootis, which is slightly larger and\nhotter than our Sun, at a distance of sixty light-years. This planet has been calculated to have\na mass equivalent to 3.87 that of Jupiter. It orbits its primary in a circular path in 3.3 days. It\nis 6.9 million kilometers (0.046 astronomical units) from its sun.33 This places it closer to its\nprimary than Earth is to our Sun.\n\nThe planet orbiting Lalande 21185, concerning which Firsoff had written in 1967, is even\ncloser to us\u2014now calculated as 8.25 light-years away. It is now believed that this star is or-\nbited by at least two planets. One of these is said to be the size of Jupiter at a distance\nequivalent to Saturn\u2019s distance from our Sun. The other planet, only slightly less massive\nthan Jupiter, is believed to orbit Lalande at about the distance of the asteroid belt.34\n\nThe binary star system CM Draconis, 50 light-years away, is also believed to be orbited\nby a planet with a diameter equal to 85 percent that of Jupiter. The stars themselves orbit\neach other around a common center of gravity once every day. The purported planet would\nthen orbit both stars in a circuit completed in \u201cseveral months.\u201d This is the first planet de-\ntected in orbit around \u201ca tightly separated binary star.\u201d35\n\nMeanwhile, Doppler shifts are not the only means by which extra-solar planets can be\ndetected. In 1996, through the use of the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers noticed that\nthe disk of dust around the star Beta Pictoris seemed to be tilted. They could only think of\ntwo possible ways in which this stellar disk could have been unbalanced: it was either due to\nradiation from the star itself or the existence of a large planet which would have tugged at the\ndebris in the disk. Two years later, Sally Heap, then of NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Cen-\nter, trained Hubble\u2019s Imaging Spectrograph on Beta Pictoris to obtain closer views of the star\nand its disk. Her verdict was that the images she was able to resolve strongly suggested a\nplanet or planets.3\u00b0 She did, however, warn that: \u201cBecause the star is shrouded in dust, it will\nbe impossible to ever see any planets around Beta Pic., so I don\u2019t know how we will get a\ndirect confirmation.\u201d3\u201d\n\nAnother extra-solar planet, calculated to be 6.84 times the mass of Jupiter, has been de-\ntected orbiting the star 70 Virginis at a mere distance of 0.47 astronomical units in an orbital\nperiod of 116.7 days.38 It was unmasked by the team of Geoffrey Marcy and Paul Butler,\u00b0\nwho have found \u201cmore planets than anyone else in history.\u201d40 Six of these planets, brought to\nlight by 1998, were featured in Astronomy; five others were reported by early 1999, two of\nwhich have been calculated to be 5 times the mass of Jupiter.4?\n\nIn the year 2000 came news of the possible discovery of extra-solar planets which ap-\npeared to measure a mere 2.5 Earth radii.

Until\nthen, as we have seen, only Jupiter-sized, and larger, planets had been located.\nWilliam Cochran and his collaborators from the University of Texas announced a planet\n\u201cthat closely resembles Jupiter\u201d around Epsilon Eridani, which is the closest star that is\nsimilar to our own Sun. Orbiting at 300 million miles from the star, it takes close to seven\nyears to complete one circuit.4\nOther extra-solar planets imbedded within the disks surrounding youthful stars, detected\nthrough means other than Doppler shifts, have been announced by Nick Gorkavyi at NASA\u2019s\nGoddard Space Flight Center. Gorkavyi\u2019s method involves a search for \u201cwhorls and clumps\nproduced by a planet\u2019s gravitational meddling.\u201d This method rewarded him with three new\nplanets, including one that is said to be only 0.2 times the mass of Jupiter, revolving around\nEpsilon Eridani, 5.5 billion miles away, which would make it about twice the distance our\nown Neptune orbits from the Sun.45\nAn even smaller planet, weighing in at about 0.15 Jupiter\u2019s mass\u2014which makes it about\nhalf Saturn\u2019s mass\u2014has been detected circling the star HD 83443. This one has a second\nSaturn-sized planet which, as Svitil reported, \u201cbolsters the view that groupings like our solar\nsystem are not uncommon.\u201d 4\nIn January of 2001, the extra-solar planet-hunting team lead by Geoffrey Marcy an-\nnounced the detection of \u201ca pair of planets, each about the mass of Jupiter, that whirl around\ntheir home star [Gliese 876], 15 light-years from Earth in perfect lock-step.\u201d One of these\nplanets takes 30 days to complete its orbit, the other \u201cexactly\u201d twice as long\u2014that is in a\ntwo-to-one ratio.47\nAlso announced by Marcy and his team is a solar system, dominated by the star HD\n168443, at a distance of 123 light-years in the constellation Serpens. This system harbors a\n7.7 to 15 Jupiter-mass planet accompanied by another body that has been calculated to be\nfrom 17 to 40 times as massive as Jupiter. A body that massive had astronomers scratching\ntheir heads since they could not \u201cquite figure what it can be.\u201d As Marcy himself noted: \u201cIt\u2019s\na bit frightening.\u201d \u00ae\n\u201cWhat\u2019s frightening,\u201d reports Michael Lemonick, \u201cis that these discoveries make it clear\nhow little astronomers know about planets...\u201d49 Or, as Princeton astronomer Scott Tremaine\nput it: \u201cNot a single prediction for what we\u2019d find in other systems has turned out to be cor-\nrect.\u201d50\nAs of this writing, the number of extra-solar planets that have been detected orbiting\nother stars had risen to 55.5! The problem caused by all these discoveries was succinctly\nstated by Flamsteed when he wrote that:\n\u201cAfter decades of searching, we\u2019ve finally found other planets orbiting other stars,\nand found them in abundance. Now the only problem is figuring out how on Earth to\nexplain them.\u201d 52",
