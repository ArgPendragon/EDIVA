It was a \u201cpre-existing polar configu-\nration\u201d that was disturbed \u201cby the increasing influence of the Sun.\u201d\nWhat seems to have transpired is that Earth\u2019s axis was temporarily and slightly dislodged\nas the Sun attempted to separate it from Saturn. The Saturnian system\u2019s entry into the Sun\u2019s\ndomain, however, was a prolonged development that unfolded in a series of awe-inspiring\nevents. For a while of relative short duration, Earth teetered slightly off balance, and it was\nduring this precarious episode that Saturn was seen to slowly circle around its former station-\nary spot. The god wandered for a time. But Saturn was soon to reassert its hold upon its sat-\nellite and the deity returned to his former motionless locale. There is, of course, much that\nwent on before this temporary interlude, and even more that followed it\u2014but the detailed ac-\ncount of all that, complete with the relative evidence, will have to wait for the proposed se-\nquel to this work.\nThrough all this we have not been able to lay down our dragon\u2019s ugly head\u2014because, if\nthe mechanics behind the break-up of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 are not the ones we seek in\nexplaining the manner in which the Saturnian system could have maintained its axial cou-\npling, we are simply back to where we had started at the beginning of this chapter. What\nShoemaker-Levy 9 taught us is that linear formations can exist, but only for a short period.\nThat is not what we seek. What is required is a means to keep such a formation linearly\naligned for a much longer period\u2014longer than 3 months, longer than 45 years, 100 years, or\n200 years. We need to discover a means to keep Saturn and Earth axially coupled for\nthousands of years, if not even longer.\nWhat, then, is the answer?\nCOSMIC JETS\nThe subject of the Saturnian co-axial system was discussed during the private round-table\nsession held for the speakers at the 2000 KRONIA Communications world conference in\nPortland, Oregon. At that time, the astrophysicist Halton Arp declared that linear formations\nare not uncommon in the cosmos\u2014to which he added the caveat that such formations are\nonly possible if given a long time to form. While this declaration should have raised eye\nbrows, it raised but little.\nWhen, a month later, I asked Arp what linear formations he had in mind,\u201d he referred me\nto the \u201ccondensations\u201d which had been discovered being ejected by galaxies.!\u00a9 These\ncondensations, as Arp called them, are now known to be \u201cviolent jets of plasma that erupt\nfrom the cores of some galaxies\u201d !\u00b0! in poleward directions. In other words, the jets in ques-\ntion are shot out along the axis of the galaxy\u2019s rotation. How are these jets formed?\nOnce deemed anathema to astronomy, electric currents are now known to exist through-\nout the Solar System. As James Peebles declared:\n\u201cNo one today denies the importance of magnetic fields and currents in the solar sys-\ntem and in its formation. This is now completely accepted.\u201d 102\nMore than that, as noted earlier in this work, 99% of the universe is now known to consist\nof plasma, an ionized gas that can conduct electricity. This led the plasma physicist and\nNobel laureate Hannes Alfv\u00e9n to ask: \u201cwhy shouldn\u2019t plasma still behave the same way for",

The currents flow in\ngreat filamentary spirals toward the center of the galaxy, where they turn and flow\nupwards along the spin axis.\u201d!05\nIt is this model, according to Alfv\u00e9n, which accounts for the violent jets that are observed\nerupting from the centre of galaxies.\n\u201cEvery now and then [says Alfv\u00e9n], the electric current in a galaxy short-circuits and\ndumps a vast amount of energy into the core. The galaxy \u2018blows a fuse,\u2019 and the blast\npropels a jet of plasma up the spin axis.\u201d 10\nMost astrophysicists, on the other hand, claim that these jets are due to the intense gravity\nof a black hole harboring at the centre of these galaxies,!\u00b0\u2019 even though the existence of\nblack holes themselves has recently been raising some serious doubts. !\u00b08 But when it comes\nto similar jets expelled by a breed of new stars, to say nothing of the remains of supernovae,\nthe black hole explanation becomes untenable.\nThe Crab Nebula is the remains of just such a star which went supernova in 1054 A.D.\nThe explosion blazed so brightly that it was visible from Earth in broad daylight. Plasma jets\nsimilar to the ones seen ejecting from galaxies, to say nothing of a ring of hot plasma, have\nrecently been revealed by X-ray photography around the \u201cinner workings\u201d of the Crab. The\nplasma ring itself has been calculated to be 200 times wider than the Solar System. This ring\nis believed to be \u201cpowered by particles shooting along the star\u2019s magnetic poles\u201d which cre-\nate the twin jets that are seen \u201cfiring out perpendicularly to the ring.\u201d !\u00a9 An identical situa-\ntion has been found in the Vela supernova remnant. !!0\nThe same is true of young stars, which are now believed to form from gas and dust which\n\u201cclump\u201d at the centre of \u201can envelope of material\u201d surrounded by \u201ca swirling disk.\u201d Magnetic\nforces then \u201cdirect jets along the axis.\u201d\nActually, even our own Sun is now posited to have exhibited such bi-polar outflows,!!! to\nsay nothing of a so-called accretion disk, a remnant of which remains to this day as a circum-\nsolar ring of asteroidal dust.!!2\nBut what have these cosmic jets to do with Earth\u2019s axial coupling with proto-Saturn?",

(The jet itself is labeled HH 409.) HH 34 has\nat least five of these globular clusters all lined up in a row along the star\u2019s polar jet. The tell-\ntale \u201caccretion disk\u201d is also shown encircling HD 163296.\n\nHere, then, was incontestable evidence\u2014nay, proof\u2014that axially aligned linear forma-\ntions were not only possible, but actually existed in space. They line up along plasma jets\nejected poleward, sharing the same axis of rotation as their parent star, exactly as has been\nposited for Earth and Saturn in this study. Nor can it be said that these configurations are in\nany way transitory, as in the case of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, since they are believed to\nexist for millions of years\u2014and thus Arp\u2019s caveat re the \u201cvery long time\u201d needed for their\nformation. Moreover, rather than being uniquely rare cases, Herbig-Haro objects occur in\nprofusion. As of 1994, as many as 250 of such objects had been discovered,!!5 and more\nkeep being added to the list.\n\nNow if these stars can line up as much as five bodies in co-axial alignment, what is so\nimpossible about proto-Saturn having had one such body, that is Earth, similarly aligned?\nMoreover, as those who are already familiar with the Saturn thesis know, and as I intend to\nshow in future sequels, Proto-Saturn eventually ended up having at least three planetary\nbodies co-axially aligned. Thus, whatever keeps the bodies in Herbig-Haro jets axially\naligned would also have kept Saturn and Earth (to say nothing of later planets) in similar\nalignment.\n\nWhat I must stress here is that all this is not to say that the Saturnian system was a Her-\nbig-Haro object, the immense masses and distances of which alone would preclude such an\nidentity. What is being hypothesized is that the Saturnian system can be visualized to have\nbeen a scaled down version of such an \u201cobject,\u201d concerning which more will be revealed in\nour final chapter.\n\nAt this crucial point, however, the following question presents itself: Did proto-Saturn\ndisplay jets?",
