In fact,\nMorning Star\u2019s pre-eminence was such that no writer can treat of this North American Indian\nnation without wondering how this star acquired such significance in the religious beliefs of\nthese people. That the Pawnee Morning Star was the planet Mars has now been astronomi-\ncally verified\u2122 and accepted by most anthropologists and archaeoastronomers.\u201d* Up until\n1906, the Pawnee were still offering human sacrifice to it.'\u201d\nSo, similarly, with the more sophisticated nations of Mesoamerica. Thus Susan Milbrath\nhas observed that a \u201cnumber of scholars agree that the fundamental nature of the ancient\nMesoamerican pantheon is astronomical.\u201d'\u201d The same view has also been echoed by David\nKelley, who wrote: \u201cIt has been clear to all serious students of Mesoamerican culture that\nthere was an intimate relationship between astronomical knowledge, the calendar, and reli-\ngious beliefs and rituals.\u201d\nAs Ev Cochrane more recently stated: \u201cA prominent characteristic of Mesoamerican as-\ntronomy, immediately apparent, was their obsession with the observation and worship of the\nplanet Venus.\u201d'\u201d And this despite the fact that B. C. Brundage, on considering the function\nthe planet Venus played among the Mesoamericans, had no recourse but to offer the obser-\nvation that the planet\u2019s true role in the development of this particular culture \u201cis not under-\nstood.\u201d\"\u00ae He also, however, added:\n\u201cJt might not be far wrong to look upon the Mesoamericans\u2019 great skill in numeration\nas a child of that planet and to state that their intellectual life pulsed to its periods.\nCertainly a significant portion of their mythology involved that planet.\u201d\nThus Anthony Aveni, one of the foremost archaeoastronomers of the twentieth century,\ncould not help but avow that \u201c[flor the Maya the importance of Venus ... cannot be over-\nstated.\u201d\"\u201d In fact what student of Mesoamerican lore can delve into the religious beliefs of\nthese people without running headlong into Quetzalcoatl, perhaps the greatest Mesoamerican\ndeity, at whose death, as we have already seen, his heart flew out to become the Morning\nStar.\nBut what of more ancient nations?",

    "content": "The Indic Linga Purana preaches that \u201cthe worship of the planets should be pursued by\ngood men,\u201d and then unambiguously identifies each planet with a major Hindu\ndeity \u2014thus:\n\n\u201cTt is cited that the planet Mars is Skanda (Karttikeya) the commander-in-chief of the\narmy of Devas. People of perfect knowledge say that Mercury is lord Narayan. O ex-\ncellent brahmins, the great planet Shaniscara, the slow-moving Saturn, is Yama, the\nlord of the worlds. The preceptors of Devas and Asuras [that is Shukra and Brihas-\npati] are the great planets Venus and Jupiter with (refulgent) rays. They are\nmentioned as the sons of Prajapati.\u201d\"\u2122*\n\nIn the Hebrew Talmud, the very meaning of \u201cidolatry\u201d is defined as the \u201cworship of stars\nand constellations.\u201d\n\nBut none of this has stemmed criticism concerning the synonymy of planets and gods as\nthey appear in ancient literature and beliefs. That planets were deified and worshipped as\ndeities has, of course, been accepted\u2014and how can it be otherwise when the evidence is\nthere for all to read about. What has not been accepted is that this has always been so. What\ncritics generally claim is that the planets had not always been gods\u2014that, on the contrary, the\ndeification of the planets owes its origin to a late date. But, as I have now been asking for a\nnumber of years, how late is late? Or, to ask a different question, how far back in history can\nthis belief be traced?\n\nIgnoring, or sweeping aside, the statements of Aristotle, critics continue to maintain that\nthe Greek identification of the planets as gods does not trace beyond the 4th century B.C. But\nis Greek lore the yardstick by which to measure the antiquity of anything? The Greeks, after\nall, came somewhat late on the ancient historical scene. What about those nations that were\nolder, much older, than the Greeks?\n\nIn Egypt the planets were also deified. Saturn was called Heru-ka-pet, that is Horus the\nBull of Heaven; Jupiter was Heru-ap-sheta, the Star of the South; Venus was Sbat uatitha, the\nEvening Star; Mars was Heru-khuti and/or Heru-tesher, the Red Horus; and Mercury was Se-\nbku and/or Sebek.\u2019\u00ae Granted, it will be pointed out that these names and identifications be-\ncame popular during the late Graeco-Roman period and that they do not trace further back\nthan the 19th Dynasty. But the identity of the Morning Star as Horus was already known\nduring the Old Kingdom and is found recorded more than once in the Pyramid Texts.\u201d In\nfact, to the ancient Egyptians, the synonymy of gods and planets was so complete that, in\nsome instances, the same word was employed to signify either. Thus sba, among other\nthings, meant \u201cstar,\u201d but Sba was also the name of a \u201cstar\u201d god.\u2019 The word netru meant\n\u201cstars,\u201d but it also meant \u201cgods.\u201d As Faulkner pointed out:",
