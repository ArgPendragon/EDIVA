    "content": "all times\u2019...yet it seems advisable to emphasize, on the one hand, that technical ter-\n\nminology has its own laws and is not subject to the jurisdiction of linguists, and to\n\npoint, on the other hand, to one of the Sanskrit names of Saturn, i.e., \u2018Kala,\u2019 meaning\n\n\u2018time\u2019...\u201d\"\u00b0\n\nThus, in Sanskrit, one of the names for the planet Saturn and the word for \u201ctime\u201d are one\nand the same, both rendered \u201cKala.\u201d But also:\n\n\u201cTt should be stressed that the disinclination of philologists to allow for the \u2018essential\u2019\nconnection of Chronos and Kronos rests upon the stern belief that the \u2018god\u2019 Saturn\nhas nothing to do with the planet Saturn, and upon the supposition that an expert in\nclassical philology has nothing whatever to learn from Indian texts. Were it not so,\nthey might have stumbled over Kala, i.e., Chronos, as a name of Yama, i.e., Kronos,\nalias the planet Saturn.\u201d\u201d\u201d\n\nThat Time (Kala) was a name of Yama can also be learned from E. Burgess;'* that the\nHindu Yama, the same as the Persian Yima, was Saturn can be learned from Hermann Col-\nlitz.'\u00b0 So that this, also, is the same as saying that Time was another name for Saturn.\n\nBesides, leaving Chronos aside, Kronos was himself lauded as \u201cthe originator of times.\u201d\u201d\n\nKALA\n\nTo the Hindus, the \u201cWheel of Time\u201d is known as the Kala-cakra (or \u201cchakra\u201d).\u201d' Of im-\nportance to our thesis is the fact that it was Brahma, i.e. Saturn, who is said to turn this wheel\nof time.\u201d In the Svetasvatara Upanishad, it is stated that: \u201cSome wise men, deluded, speak\nof Nature, and others of Time as the cause of everything, but it is the greatness of God by\nwhich this Brahma-wheel is made to turn.\u201d\u201d Thus the same source alludes to Brahma as \u201cthe\ntime of time.\u201d The Mundaka Upanishad proclaims that the year, indeed, came from\nBrahma.\u201d What has also significant meaning is the added fact that the waters of chaos, which\nwe have previously had reason to connect with Saturn, were said to have arisen from Kala.\u201d",

    "content": "Stecchini, on the other hand, reversed the process by assuming that it was \u201cbecause of\nKronos\u2019s association with time that his name was given to the most distant of the seven\nheavenly bodies...because it concludes its orbit in 30 years, so that a day in its year corre-\nsponds to a month in the earth\u2019s year.\u201d\n\nSaturn\u2019s slow motion along its orbit, however, does not explain why the planet was also\nchosen to represent the year. If any celestial body can presently claim the right to represent\nthe year, it surely would have to be the Sun. As an indicator of the passage of time, it remains\nsupreme. Even the Moon would have been a better indicator with which to gauge the pro-\ngress of time. Moreover, our ancient forebears, living in this primeval era, would hardly have\neven noticed the planet Satur if it then appeared, like now, as nothing but a pin-point of\nlight in the night sky. More importantly, Dupuis\u2019, or Schlegel\u2019s, as also Stecchini\u2019s, exposi-\ntions do not explain what Saturn, even as Time personified, had to do with Creation. Besides,\nwhy would the slowness of the planet Saturn have led ancient man to believe in an era when\ntime was not?\n\nAs we have indicated in earlier pages, and as we shall show more fully in a sequel vol-\nume, it was the Saturnian deity who was held responsible for the Creation. But, in an Iranian\nRivayat, this role is bestowed on Time. \u201cTime is both Creator and the Lord of Creation which\nit created,\u201d it is there stated.\u201d This is paralleled by the Atharva Veda which states that \u201cTime\ncreated the earth...\u201d** A curious passage concerning Creation in a Hindu Brahmana brings\nvarious elements together:\n\n\u201cThen the seed [of Creation] became a year. Before that time there was no year.\u201d\n\nThus, despite the fact that the waters of chaos were said to have been born of Time, as we\nhave seen above, the reverse was just as true. As it was said, the waters of chaos themselves\nproduced the year, \u201cthe ordainer of the days and nights.\u201c We also have it from the Maitri\nUpanishad that \u201cthe year, verily, is Prajapati [that is Saturn, who] is Time.\u201d\n\nWhat all this intimates is that what Hindu sources term as \u201cthe year\u201d is a synonym for\n\u201ctime.\u201d This synonymy is also apparent in Hebrew where yom (or yowm), which is normally\ntaken to mean \u201cday,\u201d has the additional meaning of \u201cyear\u201d but also \u201ctime.\u201d So, similarly, in\nEgypt. The word thera, which means \u201cyear,\u201d also means \u201ctime.\u201d Thus Ptah, whom we have\nalready seen identified as Saturn, was called \u201cthe Lord of the Year,\u201d whereas Atum, his al-\nter-ego, was called \u201cthe Lord of Time.\u201d The two epithets are synonymous.",

    "content": "\nDIONYSUS\nIn an our first chapter we saw Dionysus as the original impetus behind Greek drama. But\nwho was this god?\nThe mythology of Dionysus presents him as a rambunctious conqueror who spread ter-\nror, as well as civilization, to the (known) world. Wherever he went, he introduced the grape\nvine and, with it, the fermentation of wine. In this respect he was similar to the Egyptian\nOsiris/Saturn who also traveled the (known) world, bringing civilization to the countries he\nvisited, as so did other Saturnian deities.\nEusebius Pamphili (c. 260-340 A. D.) already knew that the Greek Dionysus was the\nequivalent of the Egyptian Osiris. He knew about this equation from Plutarch (c. 46-120 A.\nD.)\u201d and the even earlier Herodotus who lived in the 5th century B.C.* The similarity be-\ntween Dionysus and Osiris, moreover, did not merely concern their histories as civilizers, but\neven their rites. This was so much so that Herodotus was driven to claim that the rites of Di-\nonysus could only have been borrowed by the Greeks from the Egyptians.\u201d These similari-\nties, however, are not restricted to Dionysus and Osiris, but are common to various other\nSaturnian deities. (There is also some indication that, in some quarters, Dionysus was identi-\nfied as an alter-ego of Helios\u00ae who, as we have already seen, was the original Greek name of\nthe planet Saturn.)\nThe association of time with Saturn explains why the much later festivals of the New\nYear, touched upon briefly in preceding pages, were devoted to Saturn in his many guises.\nWe should therefore not be surprised to find that among these festivals were those held in\nhonor of Dionysus, who is not only identifiable as the Saturnalian king,\u201d but also directly as\nthe Saturnian deity.\u201d It was not, therefore, spurious of William Heidel to note the obvious\nconnection of Dionysus with Aion.\u00ae As Marija Gimbutas informed her readers: \u201cIn these\nfestivals, which have assimilated elements of deep antiquity, Dionysus appears as a year-\ngod.\u201d\nQUETZALCOATL UNVEILED\nThe Aztec deity Quetzalcoatl, known to the previous Maya as Kukulkan, has been\nidentified by various authorities as different celestial, and non-celestial, entities: as the Sun;*",
