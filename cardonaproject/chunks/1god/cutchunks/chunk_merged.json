It is also based on recent discoveries in astronomy, geology, and\npalaeontology. Even so, what are myths and legends?\nStrictly speaking, legends are traditional tales popularly regarded as historical myths. But\nthen what are myths? Myths are usually defined as primitive, or ancient, tales involving su-\npernatural beings, often embodying once-popular ideas concerning natural and historical\nphenomena.\nWhat, then, is the difference between myths and legends? There will be some who will\nclaim that there is no difference. Others may make a distinction between mythic tales told\nabout historical persons (legends) and mythic tales told about divine and semi-divine beings\n(mythology). Personally, I would make a further distinction in that mythology deals mostly\nwith cosmogonical origins. But let us not get caught up in semantics. Let me simply say that,\nin this work, I shall be concentrating on those tales dealing with divine and semi-divine\nbeings. One claim I shall, however, be making is that these tales are not mythic in the usually\nunderstood sense of the word. In other words, what I shall be claiming is that the tales I shall\nbe treating of are not to be considered untrue. On the contrary, I hope to show beyond a reas-\nonable doubt that these tales truly reflect events that, bizarre though they might seem, actu-\nally transpired in ages past.\nFranz Xavier Kugler, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on Babylonian and Biblical\nastronomy, chronology, and mythology, who died in 1929, warned that:\nT= first criticism that will be leveled at this work is that it is based on nothing but\n\u201c...ancient traditions, even when they are dressed as myth and saga, cannot be\ndismissed lightly as fantastic, or worse, meaningless fabrications. It is particularly\nproper to avoid this pitfall when dealing with serious reports, especially those of a\nreligious nature such as those that occur in large number in the Old Testament.\u201d'\nIn this work, the word \u201cmythology\u201d is used in its original Greek meaning\u2014 mytholo-\ngia, from muthos or mythos, as pronounced by the Athenians, meaning \u201ctale,\u201d and logia, de-\nrived from legein (to speak): that is, the telling of tales. There is nothing in the Greek term it-\nself which specifies that these tales were considered fictional. More than that, it were these\nvery tales that formed the basis of Greek and other religions of the ancient world. True, it\nshall be countered that these ancient religions were based on false premises. What I aim to\nindicate, on the other hand, is that these premises were anything but false.",

As Roger Wescott explained, lin-\nguistic comparison suggests that the Greek word muthos is derived from a Proto-Indo-Euro-\npean stem which means \u201cto remember nostalgically,\u201d and/or \u201cto pine for.\u201d* And, as I shall\nalso endeavor to show, the contents of the world\u2019s mythology indicates exactly that\u2014a\nsorrowful longing for the conditions of a past age. Thus Wescott was inclined to state that he\nviewed myth \u201cas more wistful than wishful\u201d besides being \u201cmore commemorative than\nimaginative.\u201d?\nThose who are familiar with the contents of myth, even if only cursorily, will at once\npoint out that myths are too convoluted in their bewildering messages, when not perplexingly\ncontradictory, to be taken seriously in this day and age. But, as Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss admon-\nished, \u201cthis apparent arbitrariness is belied by the astounding similarity among myths col-\nlected in widely different regions.\u201d* Or, as Wescott succinctly phrased it: \u201cMyths are at once\nstartlingly bizarre and oppressively repetitious.\u201d* For Alan Watts, the prime paradox was that\nmyth conceals while it simultaneously reveals.\u00b0\nRITUAL\nThe systematic study of myth could be said to have been inaugurated no earlier than the\n6th century B.C.,\u2019 but it has continued unabated ever since. Myth, in its turn, is inexorably\nbound to ritual, so much so that a particular school of thought has long argued that myth is\nderived from ritual.* This view holds that myths originated as textual commentaries meant to\nexplain and justify the rites. As James Frazer noted: \u201cNo people ever observed a custom be-\ncause a mythical being was said to have once acted in a certain way.\u201d\u00b0 And as long as the\nstress is on \u201cmythical being,\u201d | heartily agree. 1 cannot, however, agree with him when he\nmaintains that \u201call peoples have invented myths to explain why they observed certain cus-\ntoms\u201d \u00b0\u2014especially since this begs the question as to why customs arose in the first place. A\nparticular myth, according to Frazer, \u201cis never so graphic and precise in its details as when it\nis a simple transcript of a ceremony which the author of the myth witnessed with his eyes.\u201d\"\n\u201cFor while many cases can be shown in which a myth has been invented to explain a\nrite [Frazer had it stated], it would be hard to point to a single case in which a myth\nhas given rise to a rite. Ritual may be the parent of myth, but can never be its child.\u201d\u201d",

Wescott, citing Edward Tylor\nand L\u00e9vi-Strauss, definitely saw this reverse as being Just as possible\u2014that rites could have\narisen \u201cas mere dramatizations of preexisting myths.\u201d \u201d Frazer himself not only knew this but\nreferred his readers to H. Usener whose views were in direct opposition to his own.\" But, as\nClyde Kluckhohn was forced to conclude, the problem as to which came first, ritual or myth,\nis one that is not likely to be solved.\"\nThus, while I cannot agree with Frazer\u2019s view, neither can I agree that the opposite is\ntrue. To begin with, I do not believe that myths owe their existence to an author\u2014at least not\nif we are speaking of the origin of any one particular myth. Myths, as I intend to illustrate,\narose as eye-witness accounts of what was actually seen and, in that sense, no author need be\ninvoked. Likewise also with custom, ritual, and religious ceremonies: They all owed their in-\nspiration to actual events which the participants attempted to recreate for purposes much\nmore sublime than Frazer ever imagined.\"\nMy own position is that myth and ritual rose together hand-in-hand in a united effort to\nperpetuate, rather than explain, what had once taken place in the ancient sky, and to com-\nmemorate those events.\nDRAMA\nIn ancient Greece, myth was not only associated with ritual but also with that form of\nentertainment that has come down to us as drama. What is interesting about Greek drama,\nand not widely known, is that the art originated in the rituals dedicated to one particular de-\nity, namely Dionysus. As Gilbert Murray observed, according to the testimony of the Greeks\nthemselves, tragedy was explicitly concerned with the \u201csufferings of Dionysus.\u201d In fact,\nwhen dissatisfied with any particular play, the Athenians were wont to exclaim that \u201cit has\nnothing to do with Dionysus.\u201d *\n\u201cGreek tragedy, strictly speaking, was a peculiar form of art with narrow limits, both\nlocal and temporary. It was, in literal meaning, a \u2018goat-song,\u2019 i.e., a molpe (dance and\nsong combined), performed at the altar of Dionysus over the sacrifice of a dismem-\nbered goat, which, by a form of symbolism common in ancient religion, represented\nthe god himself. Hardly acted outside one small district of Greece, lasting as a living\nform not much beyond the limits of the fifth century B.C., performed only at one par-\nticular type of religious festival, the Dionysia at Athens.\u201d\u201d\u201d\nTrue, a certain amount of criticism can be leveled at the above. After all, Dionysus was\nnot himself the usual subject of Greek drama\u2014at least not that we can tell from the various\nGreek plays that have come down to us\u2014since he only appears in a couple of plays.

As\nPeter James pointed out, the real subject of all Greek plays was \u201cgood drama\u2014the same\ncriterion used by Shakespeare and the rest.\u201d\u201d\n\u201cOf course Greek drama drew on religious, legendary and historical themes\u2014these\nformed the moral backbone of Greek society, from which the great dramas were crea-\nted. (Same as Shakespeare, who drew on local British traditions as well as Scandinav-\nian, Greek, Roman and Italian.) It does not mean that Greek drama somehow\n\u2018evolved\u2019 from religious ritual, though this is commonly supposed.\u201d\u201d\n\u2018evolved\u2019 from religious ritual, though this is commonly supposed.\u201d\nAs James also pointed out: \u201cThe ancient Greeks of the Sth century were much like\nus\u2014they liked a good drink, a laugh and good drama.\u201d\u201d\nOne can argue, as James has,\u201d against Murray\u2019s statements concerning the acting out of\nGreek drama as having taken place hardly \u201coutside one small district of Greece\u201d or that\nGreek drama lasted as a living form \u201cnot much beyond the limits of the fifth century B.C.\u201d\nsince the available evidence, here, seems to contradict him. Thespis, for instance, was\nrenowned for his traveling shows which were usually performed on the back of a wagon.\nEven so, I cannot agree with James when he claims that Greek drama did not evolve from\nreligious ritual.\u201d Murray himself also stated that:\n\u201cWe must remember that the subject of Greek tragedy is always the heroic saga. It is\nnever an invented story, and it is never the history of ordinary human beings. I should\ndoubt if there was any named character in an Attic tragedy who was not actually in\nsome way an object of worship: a god or hero or at least the possessor of some taboo,\ntomb, or oracle, or ritual.\u201d\u201d\nAeschylus, the Greek poet and playwright, is renowned as the founder of Greek drama.\nHe is the first of the only three Attic tragedians of whose work entire plays survive. \u201cThe first\nthing that strikes a student of Aeschylus,\u201d according to Murray, \u201cis the strong Bacchic or\nDionysiac element ... \u201d* More than that: \u201cThe ancient critics seem always to recognize that,\nwhile Dionysus was, of course, the patron of all drama, there was something specifically\nDionysiac about Aeschylus.\u201d\u201d Nor is this merely Murray\u2019s contention. The Greek biogra-\npher, Plutarch, himself had had it stated that all of the plays written by Aeschylus were\n\u201cbrimming with Dionysus.\u201d*\nHere, an incident in the life of Aeschylus may be pertinent. Apparently, the playwright\nhimself once acted a part in one of his own plays in which there was a reference to the god-\ndess Demeter. The audience, who suspected him of revealing the inviolable secrets of one of\nDemeter\u2019s rites, rose in anger against him. Aeschylus fled, seeking sanctuary, to the alter of\nDionysus which was erected in the orchestra and thus, at least temporarily, saved himself",

As we have seen, despite the odd dissenter, modern opinion mainly reflects that of the\nGreeks themselves who seem to have attained a degree of unanimity\u2014by no means the ac-\ncustomed expectancy\u2014on this particular subject. Let us not, after all, forget that the very\nword \u201ctragedy,\u201d in Greek tragodia, means nothing more than \u201cgoat song,\u201d derived from tra-\ngos, that is \u201cgoat,\u201d the sacred animal of Dionysus. Despite its enigmatic name, the goat song\nitself was sung in honor of Dionysus, describing his birth and violent end. That the term\n\u201cgoat song\u201d \u2014 tragodia\u2014became a synonym for \u201cmisfortune\u201d is therefore understandable.\nChristians, if no one else, can at least understand this much: What could be more tragic than\nthe violent death of a god?\nORALITY\nMyths and rituals originated in the days before the invention of writing. Prior to that,\nmyths were handed down orally. That having been said, the next question the critic will ask\nis: How reliable can a report of anything be if it has been handed down orally for an untold\nnumber of years before it was even written down? And, to be sure, the reliability of oral\ntradition has been the subject of controversy since the time of Euhemerus.*\nIn our own world, as we all know, different eyewitnesses are liable to offer different ver-\nsions of any single event even when the reports are collected within a very short time of the\noccurrence. Not only that, but, with each telling, each report becomes more embellished until\nall semblance of truth is muddied beyond recognition. Can you imagine the reliability of such\nreports being handed down by word-of-mouth over a few thousand years?\nAnd yet, as Dorothy Vitaliano shrewdly observed, how often have parents retold a bed-\ntime story only to be found corrected if they deviate by as much as a single word from the\noriginal version told? Such is the power of oral tradition\u2014as notice, to give but one example,",

As he aptly demonstrated, this is made evident by\nthe effortless recall of nursery rhymes learned by rote in early childhood together with other\npoems and quotations drummed into youngsters in school and college. It is by rote, which\nWarlow calls \u201cthe basic way,\u201d that every child learns the complexities of speech, the\nchronological order of the alphabet, the days in the month, multiplication tables, spelling\naids, and other fundamentals in the early garnering of knowledge. He was nowhere near ex-\naggerating when he referred to rote learning as \u201can incredibly powerful technique.\u201d\u201d\nIt has also been hypothesized that the hexameter of Homer\u2019s verses was inherited from an\nearlier oral tradition and that it was this very hexameter that helped preserve the epics.* If\nthis was so, verbatim memorization may not even have been necessary. According to Milman\nParry, the hexameters of poetic sagas such as the Iliad and Odyssey are not simply con-\nstructed of word-units but of formulas. These constitute \u201cgroups of words [co-ordinated pre-\ncisely] for dealing with traditional materials, each formula shaped to fit a hexameter line.\u201d\nThus, for instance, as Walter Ong noted, the phrase \u201cthere spoke out clever Odysseus\u201d\noccurs seventy two times in Homer\u2019s poems.\u201d Such a formula would be easy to remember\nevery time Odysseus is introduced to say something.\nPersonally, I disagree emphatically with Ong when, from this, he also surmises that\nOdysseus was thought of as being clever\u2014\u201cpolymetis\u201d\u2014not because he was supposed to\nhave been, but because \u201cwithout the epithet polymetis he could not be readily worked into the\nmeter.\u201d According to Ong, all of Homer\u2019s characters, including the deities, received their\ntime-worn epithets in order to fit the correct metrical lines of the epics in which they appear.\nThis is difficult to believe when one remembers that the same, or similar, epithets were be-\nstowed on the comparative deities of other nations which appear in poetic sagas employing\nan entirely different meter from that of Homer. In various other cases, deities carry the same,",

Previously believed to be \u201clittle more than a fairy\ntale in three parts, of which the middle part possibly reflected some historical events,\u201d the\nGudrun Epic was demonstrated by Wiencke-Lotz to be \u201can ancient oral tradition representing\na unified whole which loses its meaning when the three parts are considered separately.\u201d* As\nDavid Griffard, relying on notes by William Douglas, as well as the work of Wiencke-Lotz\nherself, was able to report:\n\u201c[Wiencke-Lotz] argues that the entire Gudrun Epic has a sound historical basis and\nthat all specific places mentioned can be found where expected geographically,\nthough their distribution covers a large geographical area. She has identified and vis-\nited the numerous places named in the tales and has traced the specific period of Gu-\ndrun\u2019s life in relation to Roman history.\u201d\u00ae\nWhat emerged from this study is that the epic is exclusively indigenous to those territo-\nries which had, at one time or another, been occupied by the Goths.

I sit\nin the pupil of the Eye.\u201d*\nNow I ask you, what meaning can be extracted from the above? As the \u201clord of the\ncrown,\u201d the deity can be understood as the crowned god. Thus he can say that his seat is on\nhis throne. There is nothing enigmatic about a crowned god sitting on his throne. But what\ndoes it mean that the deity is, or resides, \u201cin the Eye\u201d or that he sits \u201cin the pupil of the Eye\u201d?\nWhat is this \u201cEye\u201d in which the god resides? And why is the eye equated with his egg? What\nhas an eye to do with an egg? What is this egg anyway?\nAnd yet, enigmatic as these words are, together with others pertaining to different themes,\nan in-depth study will reveal their coherence and even logic once the key to the symbolism\nbehind them is understood.\nMISTRANSLATIONS\nOnce myths were put into writing, mistranslations were bound to occur. Here, an illustra-\ntion offered by Bob Forrest comes immediately to mind.\n\u201cI can imagine how odd anomalies could arise in transmission, and this point was\nbrought home to me by a curious example I came across just recently: Cinderella\u2019s\nglass slipper. I had always found it peculiar that the slipper should be said to be made\nof glass, but according to Brewer\u2019s \u2018Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\u2019 this came about\nvia a mistranslation of the phrase \u2018pantoufle en vair\u2019 (a fur slipper) as \u2018a glass slipper\u2019\n(pantoufle en verre). I do not suppose, though, that the vagaries of oral transmission\ncan account for more than the odd \u2018peculiarity\u2019 of a myth, legend or story.\u201d\u00ae\nAnother example concerns one of the most famous sayings attributed to Jesus: \u201cIt is eas-\nier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the king-\ndom of God.\u201d\u201d As Vitaliano indicated, this is more than probably a mistranslation of the\nGreek, in which the Gospels were originally written, where the Greek word for\n\u201crope\u201d \u2014 kameylos \u2014was mistranslated as \u201ccamel\u201d \u2014 kamelos. \u201d This is because the sound of\nthe Greek letter efa sounds very similar to that of epsilon to a foreign ear. Thus the words of\nJesus should be translated as: \u201cIt is easier for a rope to go through the eye of a needle, than\nfor a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God\u201d\u2014which, let\u2019s face it, makes for a better\nsimile.\nWhen it comes to Hebrew, in which the books of the Old Testament were originally set\ndown, we encounter even greater difficulties because, for one thing, Biblical Hebrew was\nwritten without vowels, thus making for confusion between words containing the same con-\nsonants but different vowel sounds, and, for another, there are over a thousand Hebrew words\nwhich appear only in the Old Testament, and, in some cases, appear there only once. How,\nthen, without comparison, can the meaning of such words be verified with certainty?\nAs will be seen in forthcoming pages, such mistranslations, which owe more to the writ-\nten word than they do to oral tradition, permeate the mythological sources of most ancient\nnations. But, rather than proving detrimental to our cause, such mistranslations, where found,\nshall actually help us ferret out the truth.",

        "content": "\nMISINTERPRETATIONS\nThe casual reader of popular mythology may not realize to what extent the subject is in-\nfused with astronomical content. This is partly due to the aversion displayed by most modern\nmythologists to anything in their studies that smacks of astronomical connections. This is so\ntrue that when Girogio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend dared to go against the com-\nmon trend in their monumental work, Hamlet\u2019s Mill, they found the doors of academia closed\nshut in their face. As Martin Bernal found reason to state:\n\u201cHaving written a major book on Galileo, de Santillana [whom Bernal qualifies as\npossibly the greatest historian of Renaissance science] became interested in the Her-\nmetic Egyptian tradition; then, late in life, he read Dupuis\u2019s Origine de tous les cultes,\nand was convinced by its argument that much of ancient mythology was indeed alle-\ngory for scientific astronomy.\n\u201cDespite de Santillana\u2019s enormous reputation, Hamlet\u2019s Mill\u2014the book in which he\nand a younger German colleague [Hertha von Dechend] set out [such a mytho-astro-\nnomical] scheme\u2014was not accepted by any university press and was published com-\nmercially. This means that respectable scholars are not obliged to take such work into\naccount. In addition, de Santillana\u2019s having stuck his neck out so far lessened his ef-\nfectiveness as a [historian]. Furthermore, his work ... could be lumped together with\na more or less \u2018lunatic fringe\u2019; this allowed or even compelled orthodox scholars to\nignore it.\u201d\u201d\nEarlier in this century, mythologists were quite aware of the astronomical nature of an-\ncient myths, but, of lately, the general assumption has been that these astral connections are\nof late derivation, having been foisted on an already existing mythology. So much can be\nsaid against this that volumes, of which this is one, can be written.\nThe problem, however, goes deeper than that because even those earlier mythologists\nwho had accepted the astronomical nature of the myths were themselves often guilty of tam-\npering with their sources so that, today, it is not easy to discern what these ancient sources\nreally had to say about the cosmic powers our ancestors venerated. This is not to be\nwondered at because, if one had to pursue the astronomical motifs inherent in most of\nmythology, one would be forced to assume that the ancients\u2019 perception of the celestial\nsphere was entirely different from that of modern man. Thus, when modern mythologists\npursue these astral myths, they tend to look up at the sky, if only figuratively, and realize that\nwhat the ancient records state about the planets, and even the Sun and Moon, bears\nabsolutely no resemblance to the present Solar System. And yet one must keep in mind that\nthese self-same ancients, as we shall see in the next chapter, were quite sophisticated when it\ncame to observational astronomy. Thus something of a dilemma faces the mythologist as was\npoignantly demonstrated, a few decades ago, by Irene Nicholson.\nIn a Mayan scheme purported to describe the celestial sphere, Nicholson discovered that\nthe planet Venus was positioned above the Sun, below which was the Milky Way and, below\nthat, the Moon.\u201d Knowing full well that the Maya had been better astronomers than that, she\nattempted to circumvent the problem by blaming these disparities on a faulty record.",

        "content": "except for the fact that Ra shone brightly in the sky, the characteristics, and even motions,\nattributed to Ra do not fit the role of the Sun.\n\nThus, for example, Ra was often lauded as \u201cLord of the Circles\u201d and as \u201che who entereth\n[or liveth] in the Circle.\u201d\u201d He was described as \u201cthe sender forth of light into his Circle\u201d and\nas the \u201cGovernor of [his] circle.\u201d\u2122\n\nWhat is this Circle that the hymns allude to? Egyptologists will immediately inform us\nthat this Circle of which the hymns speak was what the Egyptians referred to as the Duat (or\nTuat), a word that has been rendered into English as \u201cthe Underworld.\u201d That may be so, but\nthe fact remains that Ra was said to have shone from within it. What becomes obvious, in\nother words, is that, whatever Ra once signified, it was a celestial body that resided within a\ncircle or band or ring. As we all know, the Sun does not send forth its rays into a circle; it\ndoes not reside in a ring.\n\nThere will now be those who will tell me that, under certain conditions, the Sun is seen to\nbe surrounded by a ring. They will of course be alluding to that atmospheric re fraction which\nlends a halo, known as parhelia, to the solar orb. But not only is this too rare an apparition to\nhave earned Ra his title of \u201cGovernor of his Circle\u201d and/or \u201cLord of the Circles,\u201d it is also a\nphenomenon that is restricted to northern regions and hardly, if ever, seen at the latitude of\nEgypt. But there is more.\n\nWhen pictured on the walls of temples and on papyri, Ra is often shown surmounted with\na red or golden disc, which is not inappropriate if the Sun is truly being represented. In the\nliturgies dedicated to him, however, Ra is described as having shed a green, rather than a\ngolden, light. Thus a hymn to Ra states: \u201cThou hast come with thy splendours, and thou hast\nmade heaven and earth bright with thy rays of pure emerald light.\u201d\u201d\n\nIn another hymn we read: \u201cO Ra ... the heir of eternity, self-begotten and self-born, king\nof earth, prince of the netherworld ... thou dost rise in the horizon of heaven and sheddest\nupon the world beams of emerald light ...\u201c\u00ae\n\nNot only did this sun shed a green, or emerald, light, it itself was green. As Donald\nMackenzie informed his readers, in his form of Sebek-Tum-Ra, this sun was the \u201cradiant\ngreen disk.\u201d \u201cHail Green One,\u201d was the manner in which Ra was lauded.\u201d\n\nMythologists have nothing to say by way of explaining why the ancient Egyptians al-\nluded to the Sun as having been green and shedding a green light. And, as long as they con-\ntinue to believe that Ra was the Sun, how can they? Does our Sun shed a green light? Is the\ndisk of the present sun green?\n\nConsider further the motions of the celestial object called Ra. In a statement found in one\nof the Coffin Texts, the deity is addressed with these words: \u201cYou shall go up upon the great\nWest side of the sky and go down upon the great East side of the earth.\u201d\u201d Is not this contrary\nto what the present Sun does? Does the Sun today \u201cgo up\u201d in the west? Does it \u201cgo down\u201d in\nthe east? Thus Faulkner, who translated this passage, could not help stating that this\n\u201cunexpected reversal of the points of the compass is incomprehensible\u201d\u2122\u2014and ended up by",

Unfortu-\nnately, these incongruous astronomical oddities have never been collected in one place in an\neffort to analyze them as a whole\u2014which is exactly what I intend to do in the chapters that\nwill follow.\n\nCONTRADICTIONS\n\nContradictions permeate ancient accounts. This is especially true, but not restricted to, the\ntales contained in the Old Testament and those that constitute what is generally termed Clas-\nsical mythology. To give but just two examples:\n\nIn chapter six of the Book of Genesis, which describes the loading of the ark in prepara-\ntion for the coming deluge, it is written that God commanded Noah to take aboard two, a\nmale and a female, of every living beast.\u201d But in chapter seven of the same book, the com-\nmand to Noah is to take aboard two only of unclean beasts, but seven of every clean beast as\nwell as of every kind of fowl.\u201d Why the difference?\n\nThe second example I will give comes from Greek mythology and concerns the goddess\nAthena. According to Hesiod, the father of Greek didactic poetry, Athena was born from the\nhead of Zeus,\u201d a tale that became very popular among the ancient Greeks. But, despite the\nnotability of Hesiod\u2019s tale, Athena\u2019s parentage, as also the nature of her birth, was not\nunanimously agreed upon among the Hellenes. To some it was Poseidon who fathered\nAthena, Zeus becoming her adopted father only because the goddess disowned the god of the\nsea.\u201d To others, Athena\u2019s father was Itonus, king of Iton in Phithiotis.\u00ae Next in popularity to\nHesiod\u2019s tale was that which claimed that Athena was fathered by the giant Pallas whom she\nlater slew and flayed.\u201d According to Apollodorus, on the other hand, Pallas was the name of\nAthena\u2019s playmate whom she also slew, but accidentally, while engaged in friendly",

        "content": "\ncombat.\u201d Apollonius Rhodius tells us that, according to the Pelasgians, Athena was born on\ncombat.\u201d Apollonius Rhodius tells us that,  according to the Pelasgians, Athena was born on\nthe shores of Lake Tritonis in North Africa,\u201d having been fostered by Triton (or Tritos), the\nthe shores of Lake Tritonis in North Africa,\u201d   having been fostered by Triton (or Tritos), the\ndeity of the lake.\u201d Philo Byblius, basing his report on that of Sanchoniathon and quoted by\nEusebius of Caesarea, stated that Athena was the daughter of Kronos.*\nSo which of these versions, if any, is the correct one? Better still: If, as stated above,\nmythic lore was faithfully transmitted by word of mouth through the ages before it became\nengraved in writing, how did we end up with so many different versions of the same tale?\nWhile it is tempting to blame such contradictions on faulty recording when these myths were\nfirst written down, such is not always the case.\nThe example given above concerning Noah from the Book of Genesis was not chosen at\nrandom. It was chosen specifically to clarify a conundrum.\nThus, in that passage which tells that only two of every beast was to be taken aboard the\nark, the instructions come from Elohim, an ancient name which is usually translated as\n\u201cGod\u201d in most English versions of the Old Testament. But in the passage which specifies that\nseven should be the number taken on board of the beasts designated as clean, the command is\nsaid to have come from Yahweh, sometimes rendered \u201cJehovah,\u201d another ancient name\nwhich is usually translated as \u201cthe Lord\u201d in English versions of the same work.\nWe shall not, at this point, involve ourselves in a discussion concerning whether or not\nthese two names\u2014 Yahweh and Elohim\u2014were but two different designations for one and the\nsame deity. We shall leave that for later. Biblical scholars, however, had long ago realized\nthat the Old Testament preserves more than one tradition, and that, among other things, these\ndifferent traditions can be recognized by the name applied to what one usually considers as\nhaving been \u201cGod.\u201d One of these traditions referred to the deity as Elohim, another tradition\nreferred to him as Yahweh. Thus Biblical scholars refer to these different versions, among\nothers, as the Elohist tradition on the one hand, and the Yahwist tradition on the other. Origi-\nnally, these different traditions belonged to different peoples who had passed on their tradi-\ntions by word of mouth, without change, from one generation to the next. But, as happened\nso often in the past, these different peoples merged to become one nation even though each\nfaction was persistent in retaining its particular version of what they believed to have tran-\nspired in the past. At an even later time, when they decided to put their history into writing,\nthese various traditions were incorporated as a unified, but not seamless, whole. And that, to\nput it simply, is what the Old Testament, as it exists today, consists of.\nSo, similarly, with the ancient Greeks, who referred to themselves as Hellenes, suppos-\nedly after Helen of Troy, a nation that was forged from the remnants of earlier civilizations\nand wandering tribes\u2014Pelasgians, Minoans, Mycenaeans, Achaeans, Trojans, Ionians, Dori-\nans, and heaven knows who else\u2014each of whom brought their own traditions into that Indo-\nEuropean melting pot that has become known as Greek history and Classical mythology.\nEven so, why should there be more than one version of any one particular myth? Here I\ncan best ask the reader to consider an event from the modern world\u2014the blowing up, by the\ninvading army, of the colossal swastika that had towered above the Germans in symbolic\nsplendor above so many Nazi rallies. As Lewis Greenberg noted: \u201cThere appears to be some\nconfusion over which swastika was dynamited, with some opting for one over the Reichstag",

It hap-\npened at a time when the recording of history had already reached perfection, at a time when\nevents could be frozen and immortalized on film. And, as it happens, the event in question\nwas exactly so documented. As Greenberg noted:\n\u201cThe last two choices are definitely in error. Film footage of the great swastika being\nblown up (as seen in the film The Enigma of the Swastika) leaves no doubt and\nclearly indicates that it was the Zeppelinfeld swastika.\u201d\nIf the memory of events from the recent past can get to be so confused, why should we\nwonder about the faulty memory concerning events from a much more remote past? But\nthen, without a film to document these earlier events, how can we ever be sure of what really\ntranspired?\nTwo lessons to be learned from the above example are these: Despite the differing ver-\nsions as to which swastika was blown up by the invading army, all reports agree on one fact:\nA colossal swastika in Germany was blown up by the invading army. That is the core of this\nparticular historical event. And, in many cases when dealing with contradictory versions of a\nparticular myth, it is the core of the event that we must hold on to and not necessarily the de-\ntailed trimmings, many of which were, in any case, appended to the myths at a much later\ntime. Thus, whether it was just one pair or seven of each animal that Noah was said to have\ntaken into his ark, the core of the different tales remains that he did take male and female\nspecimens of the animals on board. The second lesson is that various versions of an event can\nbe compared and, with a little help from logic, the correct one can often, if not always, be as-\ncertained. When it comes to the science of mythology\u2014and it is a science\u2014comparison can\nbe a very effective tool.\nCOMPARISONS\nHermann Collitz had this to say about the subject:\n\u201cComparative mythology, in co-operation with the study of popular traditions\n(folklore), has been especially studied with assiduity...Mythological science is not\nintended to serve the knowledge of cultural development\u2014be it of a people or of a\ngroup of closely related peoples\u2014it does not primarily co-operate with philology, but\nit looks for similar ideas in different peoples and it tries to determine types which are\nrepeated in the course of time.\u201d\nIn other words, comparative mythology is that branch of mythology which compares the\nmyths of one nation, or race, with those of another\u2014and, sometimes, even compares the\nmyths of one particular nation, or race, with the divergent myths found within the same na-\ntion or race. Among other things, this is done in order to identify the unidentified protago-\nnists in one myth with the identified ones in another, but similar, tale. An example that comes\nto mind is the following:",

        "content": "\nA tale from the Hindu lore of India concerns the goddess Kali whose thirst for gore\u2014she\nis often portrayed with hanging tongue and mouth dripping with blood\u2014was developed after\nshe had slain the asura (or demon) Raktavira (also known as Raktabija). From every drop of\nblood that fell to the ground from the wounded asura, there sprang another demon possessing\nhis courage, strength, and valor.'\u00ae In order to keep Raktavira\u2019s blood from reaching the\nground, and thus generating further demons, Kali, also known as Durga, was forced to drink\nit as it gushed out. This drinking of blood gave her such a blind lust for violence that, when\nshe gave free reign to it, nothing was able to stop her. \u201cOn one occasion Shiva himself had to\nmingle among the demons whom she was slaughtering and allow himself to be trampled un-\nderfoot in her dance of victory, as this was the only way to bring her to her senses and save\nthe world from collapse.\u201d '\u00ae\nThis myth is very similar to one involving the goddess Anath. In a myth from Ugarit we\nsee Anath coming to the aid of Baal when he was beset by his enemies. As cruel a goddess as\nKali, Anath did not limit her slaughter to demons but went on a drunken rampage against\nmankind from \u201cfrom the rising of the sun\u201d to \u201cthe shore of the sea.\u201d\"\u2122 In the end, Baal was\nforced to intervene in order to stop the goddess from annihilating mankind.\nAs William Albright reported:\n\u201cIt has been pointed out by Marvin Pope that there are many traits which Anath\nshares in common with the Indic goddess Kali or Durga. In fact, the respective figures\nare in some ways so similar that coincidence can scarcely be the only explanation.\u201d\nYet another similar myth that both Pope and Albright failed to notice comes to us from\nancient Egypt. Here we read of the goddess Sekhmet, who was said to have been Ra\u2019s de-\nstructive eye, being hurled in anger at mankind. Incited by Ra himself, the goddess began a\nslaughter so complete that she ended up by flooding the world in blood. In both this myth and\nthat of Anath, each respective goddess is described as wading up to her waist in gore. In the\nend, like both Shiva and Baal, Ra himself was forced to intervene and call the goddess\nback.\nAs can be seen, there seems to be no doubt that, in the above three myths, despite the dif-\nference in details, the same event is being described. This leads to the assumption, which we\ncan state beyond a reasonable doubt, that the three goddesses, Kali (or Durga), Anath, and\nSekhmet were merely different names, applied by different nations who spoke different lan-\nguages, of one and the same goddess.\nLet me now concentrate on Anath (sometimes transliterated as Anat) in order to further\nillustrate the methodology behind comparative mythology. What we know of this goddess\ncomes mostly, but not solely, from the tablets discovered at Ras Shamra, the ancient Ugarit,\nin a priest\u2019s house adjoining the temple of Baal.'\u201d In one of these texts we read that Anat\nwas described as a \u201cstar.\u201d\"\u00ae Her alter-ego, the Persian Anahita (sometimes transliterated as",

        "content": "DIFFUSION\n\nJoseph Campbell, perhaps the most popular mythologist of the latter half of the twentieth\ncentury, began the first tome of his four-volume work, The Masks of God, by pointing out\nthat the \u201ccomparative study of the mythologies of the world compels us to view the cultural\nhistory of mankind as a unit; for we find that such themes as the fire-theft, deluge, land of the\ndead, virgin birth, and resurrected hero have a worldwide distribution\u2014appearing every-\nwhere in new combinations while remaining, like the elements of a kaleidoscope, only a few\nand always the same.\u201d\"\u201d\u00b0 It was thus his view, as it has been that of many another mytholo-\ngist, that the ideas inherent in the mythological record owe their universal distribution to a\nradiating diffusion, especially by contact and mainly from \u201cthe nuclear Near East.\u201d As he had\nit stated: \u201cThe archaeology and ethnography of the past half-century have made it clear that\nthe ancient civilizations of the Old World\u2014those of Egypt, Mesopotamia, Crete and Greece,\nIndia and China\u2014derived from a single base, and that this community of origin suffices to\nexplain the homologous forms of their mythological and ritual structures.\u201d\"\u201d To be sure,\nthere is no doubt that ideas\u2014knowledge\u2014traveled from one people to another. Thus, for in-\nstance, it has been known for years that ancient Greek astronomical beliefs owed their impe-\ntus to Babylonian knowledge, as well as to that of other nations.\n\nOne may therefore suppose that the similarity of the myths enumerated above conceming\nthe goddesses Anath, Kali, and Sekhmet could have been passed on from one people to an-\nother. Is it not possible, for instance, that the Indo-European Aryans brought the myth of Kali\nwith them, which myth was then passed on to both Canaan and Egypt through migrational\ncontact? Possible, yes; but, despite Campbell, highly unlikely, especially since the three god-\ndesses do not share a common, or similar, name. Thus, for instance, while we can see the\nsimilarity \u2014or, actually, the evolution\u2014of the names from the Canaanite Anath, or Anat, to\nthe Persian Anahita, Anahid, and/or Anaitis, from which we can safely suppose a diffusional\ncontact, direct or otherwise, between Canaan and later Persia, there is nothing linguistically\nrelated between the names Anath, Kali, and Sekhmet. Nor do these three goddesses share a\nsimilarity in their physical depiction. Although pictorial depictions of Anath are rare, she is\nusually portrayed as a seductive-looking female with a very distinctive hair style shaped in\nthe form of the Greek letter omega. Kali, on the other hand, is always depicted as a ferocious-\nlooking and emaciated hag with disheveled hair, vampiric fangs, a lolling tongue, and shriv-\neled pendulous breasts. And while Sekhmet, like Anath, is also shown having the slim con-\ntoured form of a woman, she is invariably given the head of a lioness. One would think that,\nhad two of these goddesses been borrowed from the mythological lore of another nation, or\nrace, they would have retained some similarity of the original\u2019s name and physical appear-\nance. As we have seen, however, it is only in the detailed account of their crazed and bloody\nacts of destruction and death-dealing annihilation that the three goddess bear any similarities.\n\nOn the other hand, without wishing to contradict the above, the cult of the goddess Anat\ndid find its way from Canaan to Egypt. Among her various epithets, Anat was known as\nQadesh, or Qudshu, which simply meant \u201choly.\u201d'\u00ae The worship of this goddess, together\nwith others of Near Eastern origin, was introduced into Egypt when the Egyptians began to\ninfiltrate Palestine. Even so, despite their attempt to Egyptianize the goddess, mainly by\ndepicting her in the company of Egyptian deities, her name of Qudshu (Qetesh or Qeteshi)",

(Here I should note that Wallis\nBudge was in error when he claimed that the Egyptians gave her \u201cthe peculiar headdress of\nHathor,\u201d'\u201d since, as we have already noted, her omega-shaped hairdo had always been hers.\nThe fact that the Egyptian Hathor was similarly portrayed by the Egyptians, while not coinci-\ndental, should not blind us to this fact.) There is therefore no doubt that cults and rituals were\ntransferred from one culture to another, but, when this transpired, it left its tell-tale marks. No\nsuch marks are obvious between the cults of Anath and Sekhmet despite the similarity of\ntheir myths.\nAs William Heidel pointed out as early as 1929, \u201cthe facile assimilation of one rite to the\nother ... was probably due to the recognition of a common basis in ritual forms.\u201d'\u00ae He,\nhowever, warns that there should be \u201cmade no assumption of direct borrowing of motives, as\nis often done; such an assumption is methodically without justification where other explana-\ntions of such points of agreement as may be found are possible and sufficient.\u201d \u2122\n\u201cIdeas, without a material substratum to which they are related, are not so easily\ncommunicated as some historians appear to suppose; the experience of the Western\nworld with the East in our day would seem to show that concrete objects and modes\nof behaviour are far more readily adopted than ideas and ideals.\u201d '\u201d\nSimilar mythological ideas are not, however, restricted to the ancient lore of Asia, Eu-\nrope, and Egypt. They are also to be found on opposite shores of the Old World and the\nNew. Consider, for example, the following aspects of the myths of Osiris and Quetzalcoatl.\nIn Mesoamerica, the priest-king known as Quetzalcoatl was thought of as a civilizer, a\ncompassionate being, a lawgiver and inventor of the calendar.'*\nThe Egyptian Osiris was also thought of as a civilizer. Having become king of Egypt, he\nimparted the arts of civilization to his subjects. He taught them how to till the land, formu-\nlated a code of laws by which they should live, and instituted the rites of the gods.\u2019\nToward the end of his tragic life, Quetzalcoatl \u201cordered ... that a stone casket should be\nbuilt in which he was to lie four days and nights in strict penance.\u201d\nThe end of Osiris was similarly woeful. His brother and enemy, Set\u2014whom his biogra-\npher, Plutarch, refers to as Typhon\u2014managed to trap him within a chest, which he instantly\nnailed shut and flung into the river.\u201d\nWhen Quetzalcoatl died\u2014some said by throwing himself on a funeral pyre\u2014his heart\nflew out of him into the sky to become the Morning Star.'\u201d\u201d\nNow, as is well known, Egyptian rites of the dead attempted to assimilate the deceased\npharaoh to Osiris. In the Text of Unas it is told that \u201cthe king\u2019s soul, provided with its words\nof power, flew with its wings to heaven, and \u2018opened\u2019 its seat there with the stars of the sky,\nand itself became the morning star ... \u201c\"* Since the dead king was believed to recreate the",

But it was not, as generally believed,\ndiffusion by contact. On the contrary, it seems to have been diffusion by separation.\nDIVINE REVELRY\nAt this point, it should perhaps be pointed out that the problems involved in the interpre-\ntation of mythology is not merely a modern concern. The same problems occupied the minds\nof the ancients themselves\u2014definitely the ancient Greeks who were very \u201cconcerned with\nthe relation of rationalism to traditional beliefs.\u201d\"* As Fred Bratton noted:\n\u201cThe Sophists and Neoplatonists anticipated one modern solution by defining myths\nas allegories that symbolized moral or spiritual truth and were not to be taken liter-\nally. The Neoplatonic and Stoic philosophers of the Hellenistic period were thus able\nto hold both to tradition and rationalism. This method of interpretation was rejected\nby Plato and the later Epicureans as just a way of keeping intact the traditional super-\nnatural beliefs of the state religion and keeping the facts of history from the people.\nThe emperor Julian regarded myths as esoteric teachings understood only by the intel-\nlectual aristocracy. The early Christian theologians discredited the pagan myths while\nteaching new ones for the Hebrew and Christian religions.\u201d '\u201d\nteaching new ones for the Hebrew and Christian religions.\u201d\nOther than as a form of art, often more of a voluptuous or heroic nature than not, mythol-\nogy is not much valued by the modern layman. Yet, in one form or another\u2014and this in-\ncludes past and recent occultism among our youth\u2014religion is. Here lies one of the major in-\ncongruities of the problem I wish to address because, in essence, religion is only the philo-\nsophical interpretation and mystic ritualization of myth.\nThe forms which man\u2019s various religions have taken in the past, and continue to take in\nthe present, are endless. The names of his past and present gods are legion. The rituals he has\ninvented with which he has sought, and continues to seek, divine protection and godly bless-\ning have run the gamut from love feasts to horrible mass human sacrifice. Throughout the\nages, the expositional interpretation and theological apologetics concerning his rites and be-\nliefs have filled untold volumes most of which do nothing but contradict each other.\nMeanwhile, the discoveries of anthropology and archaeology keep adding evidence not\nonly of the antiquity of man\u2019s basic faith but also of the universality of its thematic structure.\nEven that indomitable primitive, Neanderthal Man, it finally had to be admitted, had, burning\nin his savage breast, the desperate need to satisfy, or otherwise appease, the unseen forces",

        "content": "associated with death.\u201d Man, so it now seems, has been a religious creature from the very\nmoment of his human inception.\n\nThe study of comparative religion, despite its past overall banality, has always been sub-\nject to stray insights. From the very beginning of the development of western thought, the\nphilosophes have been cognizant of the universality of certain religious rites and beliefs.\nAmong these one can enumerate all manner of lustrative rituals; the need for some sort of re-\ndemption; the immortality of the soul, the mind, or the human aura; the belief in paradise,\nhell, or some other place of existence after death; and various others.\n\nMost of these have often been explained as a psychological alleviation\u2014a ray of hope\nagainst the realization of a futile life capped with the finality of death. Man, it has been said\nbefore, is the only animal burdened with this acute awareness. It is also for this same reason\nthat those of an unreligious bent of mind, whether they realize it or not, very often find them-\nselves involved in a continuous search for the supposed meaning of life.\n\nBelief in an afterlife should not, of itself, incur a belief in God. Belief in a reward, or\npunishment, after death, on the other hand, does\u2014for someone, or something, must exist to\njudge and mete out justice. This someone, this something, this God, should logically be ex-\nemplary. How come most of man\u2019s gods are not?\n\nThe philosophic endeavor to discern moral precepts in divine action becomes something\nof a farce when one is confronted with the ungodly activities of most deities. The Greek\ngods, for instance, were guilty of patricide, butchery, cannibalism, rage, jealousy, adultery,\nrape, incest, deception, and slaughter without equal. These actions are not symbolic of moral\nprecepts; they are the irresponsible adventures of a bunch of delinquent revelers. Why, then,\ndid the Greeks look up to these imperfect gods, build them costly temples, offer them\nsacrifices, prayers, and invocations, while philosophers endeavored to illustrate the divinity\nof what they believed to be the orderly universe by comparing it with these gods?\n\nThe Stoics and pagan apologists had long attempted to spiritualize the myths described by\nHesiod and others. This spiritualization, in the form of allegorism, continued as the dominant\nmode of mythic interpretation well past the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance.'* Only\nhalf way through the seventeenth century, and more so during the eighteenth, did philoso-\nphers begin to reduce the fantastic episodes of classical mythology to common-sense narra-\ntives. But this was merely an attempt to de-allegorize the myths. The origin of the gods, to-\ngether with the rites connected with them, remained unexplained.\n\nThe actions of the Greek gods could no longer be seen as the moral conflict between good\nand evil\u2014between virtue and vice\u2014for the simple reason that, according to the myths, the\nevil, or vice, was more often triumphant than not. Zeus was guilty of more deceptions and\nrapes than any other god the Greeks venerated. Yet this same Zeus was considered to be the\nupholder of law and order. If this divine lawlessness could not be explained allegorically, it\ncould only mean that the gods were impervious to their own laws.\n\nPierre Bayle took great pleasure in accumulating tales which told of the lusts of these\ngods and goddesses who could indulge in incestuous and homosexual rape. To him, the\nGreek world was a world of sex-mad divinities.\u201d Yet the Greeks of ancient times believed\nthat these actions, normally repugnant even to them despite their hedonistic society, actually\ntook place precisely as narrated by the early poets\u2014 by Hesiod, by Homer, and others.",

        "content": "Pheidias, architect of the Parthenon and sculptor of the colossal Athena Parthenos, was\naccused of an act of impiety simply because one of the figures on Athena\u2019s shield was\nthought to resemble him. Epicurus, because he was bold enough to teach a school of mixed\nsexes, caused a scandalous stir in his day. When Praxiteles sculpted his famous Aphrodite,\nthe people of Cos were shocked by the complete nudity of the figure. Socrates, because he\npreached against the gods, was accused of blasphemy and of corrupting the youth of his time.\nFor that he was put to death. Yet these very people, so scandalized by the impiety of their\ncitizens, could look at their upholders of law, the gods, and excuse the atrocious actions they\nwere portrayed as having been guilty of.\n\nSince our western world owes so much to Classical Greece, should we not wonder at the\nincongruity of this affair? Should we not ask the question: What was it that made the an-\ncients\u2014and the Greeks were not the only ones\u2014bow their heads to such consistent lawless-\nness in the lives of their upholders of law?\n\nCELESTIAL DIVINITIES\n\nFrom Greek sources comes the following well-known tale of divine family conflict:\n\nThe goddess Gaea bore a son called Ouranos and then lay with him in incest. Ouranos\u2019\nchildren, born of Gaea, planned a revolt against their father. Ouranos therefore imprisoned\nthese rebellious sons. In revenge, Gaea inflamed her youngest-born, Kronos, to overthrow his\nfather. Kronos, hiding in ambush, attacked his father and castrated him with a sickle. He then\nbecame lord of heaven in his father\u2019s stead.\n\nFearing a similar rebellion, Kronos did not see fit to release his brethren. Worse than that,\nlaying in incest with his sister Rhea, he commenced to devour his own offspring. But when\nhis son Zeus was born, Rhea gave Kronos a stone to swallow in his stead. When Zeus grew\nto manhood, he also attacked his father and deposed him. Like Ouranos and Kronos before\nhim, Zeus then inherited the lordship of heaven.\n\nWhat philosophical insights could lay buried within this tale of incest, revenge, castra-\ntion, patricide, cannibalism, stupidity (for how could a god have mistaken a stone for his in-\nfant child?), and deception?\n\nNot that philosophers have not tried. Pierre Jurieu, for instance, saw Kronos as a symbol\nof time which devours what it first produces.\u201d Jurieu\u2019s belief derived from the fact that, in\nGreek, \u201cTime\u201d is rendered Chronos, which concept they then attributed to Kronos. Jurieu did\nnot ask what prompted the Greeks to equate time with their god Kronos\u2014and this question\nshould have been asked in view of the fact that Kronos was also the Greek name of the planet\nwe call Saturn.\n\nTo the ancient Greeks, the planet Saturn would have appeared as nothing more than a pin-\npoint of light in the night sky, no different than the way it appears to us with the unaided eye\nat present. What, then, could have impelled the Greeks to equate this pin-point of light with\nthe abstract idea of time?\n\nWhen, as narrated in the above myth, Zeus deposed Kronos, did he also depose time?\nBetter still, what does it mean that Zeus deposed Kronos?\u2014for Zeus was also the Greek\nname of a planet, that which today is known to us as Jupiter. What could it mean that the\nplanet Jupiter deposed the planet Saturn?\n\nDespite what philosophers, mythologists, and students of ancient religion might have\nwritten in the past, the tale recorded above can have no philosophical meaning \u2014at least none\nthat would not be strained. In view of the fact that Kronos and Zeus were actually deified",

After all, unlike the Sun and Moon, to the\nunaided eye the planets appear no more than small flickering pin-points of light lost amid a\nstarry sea among a multitude of other flickering pin-points of light.\nThe ancient Greeks deified all of the heavenly bodies of the Solar System that were, and\nstill are, visible to the naked eye. Saturn was Kronos who was once king of heaven. Jupiter\nwas Zeus who, as in the case of other planetary pantheons, seized the kingdom of the gods\nfrom his father Kronos/Saturn. Mars was known as Ares, the blood-thirsty god of war.\nAphrodite, the goddess of love, perhaps the most popular of the Greek deities, was the\npersonification of Venus. The planet Mercury was Hermes, with his winged sandals, the\nswiftest god among the Olympians.\nThese planetary identifications were even adopted by those ancient peoples who came\ninto direct contact with the Greeks. Thus, in The Book of the Secrets of Enoch, a Graeco-\nJewish work from the intertestamental period, the names of the planets are so given in Greek:\nKruno for Kronos/Saturn; Zeus for Jupiter; Aris for Ares/Mars; Aphrodit for\nAphrodite/Venus; and Ermis for Hermes/Mercury.'\u2122\nCan it however be said that, in the minds of the Greeks, planets and gods were\nsynonymous? I pose this all-important question because critics have often denied this to have\nbeen the case. My answer is that the identity of the ancient gods as planets should never even\nhave been questioned. The only acceptable assertion in this matter is that of those very\npeople who once believed in, and venerated, these gods. Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha\nvon Dechend recognized this truth when they wrote:\n\u201cThe most \u2018ancient treasure\u2019 ... left to us by our predecessors ... was the idea that the\ngods are really stars, and that there are no others. The forces reside in the starry\nheavens, and all stories, characters and adventures narrated  by  mythology\nconcentrate on the active powers among the stars, who are the planets.\u201d\nThis is quite a claim, to say the least, when one remembers that, at the very dawn of\ncivilization, the Sumerian list of deities already contained more than five thousand names\nwith which to reckon'*\u2014think about it! Accepting that most of these names constitute\nnothing but a litany of epithets bestowed on a much shorter list of deities, the deities\nthemselves, and the tales told about them, remain quite numerous. And yet, as we shall see,\nthis was not merely a case of epithets, for the deities themselves were often inadvertently\nduplicated, triplicated, and so forth.\nOn the other hand, to maintain that all mythological characters reduce to a handful of\nplanets, and that all mythological tales are descriptive of planetary motions, is not, in my\nopinion, a defensible position. After all, in the end, man found it expedient to recognize\ndivinity in just about everything, creating deities who would lord it over such concepts as\nbirth, health, sleep, and death and a thousand other issues to boot. Even so, I will maintain\nthat if we restrict ourselves to the world\u2019s major myths, de Santillana and von Dechend\u2019s\nclaim can be validated.",

        "content": "Aristotle had no reason to invent the equation of planets with gods. Having been widely\nforgotten by his immediate, but not his earlier, ancestors, he simply rediscovered this verity\nand sought to reaffirm it. Besides, he was not the only one to offer the assertion. Others\nmaintained and voiced identical opinions.\n\nAmong the Greeks, Lucian of Samosata also knew this truth.\"* Thus he tells us that\n\u201cfrom both Homer the poet and the epics of Hesiod we should understand that the ancients\nwere of one mind with the astrologers,\u201d and that it is \u201cthe conjunction of Venus and Mars\u201d\nthat \u201ccreates the poetry of Homer.\u201d'\u00a9 Plato, who recognized the same truth on his own, had\nit verified by the Egyptians. '*\n\nThe Romans, who, in their turn, borrowed many of their deities from the Greeks, were no\ndifferent. It is in fact to them that we owe the present names of the planets in the western\nworld so that, to this day, the planets still bear the names of the gods.\n\nKronos became Saturnus, the god of civilization. Zeus became Iuppiter, Diespiter, or\nsimply lovis, and, like his counterparts throughout the world, was considered king of all the\ngods. Ares became Marspiter, also known as Mavors\u2014pronounced Ma-oors\u2014or Marmar, a\ngod of war as blood-thirsty as his Greek counterpart. Aphrodite became Venus, retaining her\nposition as the queen of Jove and feminine beauty. Hermes became Mirqurius, or Mercurius,\nand was honored as the god of merchandise.\n\nThe synonymy of planets with gods was so entrenched among the Romans that Cicero\ndenied the possibility of planetary orbital changes simply because he believed such changes\nto be contrary to the planets\u2019 divine nature.'\u201d\n\nThis belief, that the gods were really deified astronomical bodies, even touched primitive\npeoples. Thus the name of the great Polynesian god, Ta\u2019urua, simply means \u201cstar\u201d'*\u2014and\nhere we cannot help but note the similarity of this name to that of Tara, an epithet of\nKali/Durga, mentioned earlier, which also means \u201cstar,\u201d even though no etymological con-\nnection between the two names has yet come to light. In old records of Tahiti, the name\nTa\u2019urua is applied to Fomalhaut, a star in the constellation Pisces; to Orion\u2019s belt; to Al-\nphard or Cor Hydra; Betelgeuse; Canopus in the constellation Argo; Deneb in Cygnus; and\nSirius. Each particular star was then identified by a clarifying epithet added to the name\nTa\u2019urua.\"* The same name, however, was also applied to the planets Jupiter and Venus. The\nformer was designated Ta\u2019urua-o-rai\u2019i-taetae\u2019a-o-Havai\u2019i-i-te-tua and the latter as Ta\u2019urua-e-\nhiti-Matavai.\"\u201d\n\nAmong the Skidi branch of the Pawnee Indians of North America, there were some who,\nin a sense, might be considered to have been astronomers. These men compiled star maps;\nidentified the constellations and the brightest stars among them; noted the planets and\nrecorded their movements. The beginning of the Pawnee ceremonial year was co-ordinated in\nrites.'\" As G. A. Dorsey discovered, \u201cthe greater part of the [Pawnee] heavenly gods were",

People of perfect knowledge say that Mercury is lord Narayan. O ex-\ncellent brahmins, the great planet Shaniscara, the slow-moving Saturn, is Yama, the\nlord of the worlds. The preceptors of Devas and Asuras [that is Shukra and Brihas-\npati] are the great planets Venus and Jupiter with (refulgent) rays. They are\nmentioned as the sons of Prajapati.\u201d\"\u2122*\n\nIn the Hebrew Talmud, the very meaning of \u201cidolatry\u201d is defined as the \u201cworship of stars\nand constellations.\u201d\n\nBut none of this has stemmed criticism concerning the synonymy of planets and gods as\nthey appear in ancient literature and beliefs. That planets were deified and worshipped as\ndeities has, of course, been accepted\u2014and how can it be otherwise when the evidence is\nthere for all to read about. What has not been accepted is that this has always been so. What\ncritics generally claim is that the planets had not always been gods\u2014that, on the contrary, the\ndeification of the planets owes its origin to a late date. But, as I have now been asking for a\nnumber of years, how late is late? Or, to ask a different question, how far back in history can\nthis belief be traced?\n\nIgnoring, or sweeping aside, the statements of Aristotle, critics continue to maintain that\nthe Greek identification of the planets as gods does not trace beyond the 4th century B.C. But\nis Greek lore the yardstick by which to measure the antiquity of anything? The Greeks, after\nall, came somewhat late on the ancient historical scene. What about those nations that were\nolder, much older, than the Greeks?\n\nIn Egypt the planets were also deified. Saturn was called Heru-ka-pet, that is Horus the\nBull of Heaven; Jupiter was Heru-ap-sheta, the Star of the South; Venus was Sbat uatitha, the\nEvening Star; Mars was Heru-khuti and/or Heru-tesher, the Red Horus; and Mercury was Se-\nbku and/or Sebek.\u2019\u00ae Granted, it will be pointed out that these names and identifications be-\ncame popular during the late Graeco-Roman period and that they do not trace further back\nthan the 19th Dynasty. But the identity of the Morning Star as Horus was already known\nduring the Old Kingdom and is found recorded more than once in the Pyramid Texts.\u201d In\nfact, to the ancient Egyptians, the synonymy of gods and planets was so complete that, in\nsome instances, the same word was employed to signify either. Thus sba, among other\nthings, meant \u201cstar,\u201d but Sba was also the name of a \u201cstar\u201d god.\u2019 The word netru meant\n\u201cstars,\u201d but it also meant \u201cgods.\u201d As Faulkner pointed out:",

The question we address is why.\u201d\u201d\u201d\nMost mythologists who have favored an astronomical interpretation of mythology have\nhowever been handicapped by the uniformitarian dogma that the Solar System has remained\nunchanged for millions of years. Not only that, some of them have even utilized this dogma\nas the very basis for astro-mythological beliefs. Thus, for instance, Elmer Suhr who could\nfeel confident in reporting that:\n\u201cAstronomy, including manifestations of sun, moon, stars, comets and meteors, has\nthe advantage of remaining constant in its movements and consistently the same in\nappearance over great periods of time; its forms are more geometric, its changes more\nregular, all of which gave the heavens more prestige in the mind of primitive man.\u201d\u201d*\nThis, I intend to show, has been the great pitfall of most mythologists who could not rec-\noncile the heaven alluded to by our ancient forefathers with the one that now stretches above\nand around us. And yet, as I hope to demonstrate, it was the very opposite to what Suhr be-\nlieved that lay at the very foundation of mytho-astronomical belief. In fact, what I wish to\nstress is that the astronomical bodies of the Solar System were deified by ancient man the\nworld over not because they consistently followed an ordained pattern, but precisely because\nthey did not.\nAs Lewis Farnell noted early in the twentieth century: \u201cWhat is normal in nature and so-\nciety rarely excites the myth-making imagination, which is more likely to be kindled by the\nabnormal, some startling catastrophe, some terrible violation of the social code.\u201d\nAnd as the French anthropologist Emile Durkheim (1858-1917) pointed out:\n\u201c.,.that which characterizes the life of nature is a regularity which approaches\nmonotony. Every morning the sun mounts the horizon, every evening it sets; every\nmonth the moon goes through the same cycle; the river flows in an uninterrupted\nmanner in its bed; the same seasons periodically bring back the same sensations. To\nbe sure, here and there an unexpected event sometimes happens: the sun is eclipsed,\nthe moon is hidden behind clouds, the river overflows. But these momentary varia-\ntions could only give birth to equally momentary impressions, the remembrance of\nwhich is gone after a little while; they could not serve as a basis for these stable and\npermanent systems of ideas and practices which constitute religions. Normally, the\ncourse of nature is uniform, and uniformity could never produce strong emotions.\u201d*\u00b0\nWhile not exactly an authority on mythological subjects, it is also worth noting the words\nof Frederick Hall who wrote:\n\u201cIf we will the myths their proper credence in the light of new evidence of planetary\ncatastrophism, we will find that they can add much to our store of knowledge. All\nmythical accounts may not be equally authentic\u2014and surely many are garbled\u2014but",

In fact, even that so-called pillar of astrophysics, the Big\nBang Theory, had been much earlier posited in a religious work.\nIn the Book of Genesis, Elohim, usually translated into English as \u201cGod,\u201d begins the cre-\nation with the words: \u201cLet there be light.\u201d And, it is there written, \u201cthere was light.\u201d There\nhave been many who have seen a similarity between this description of beginnings and the\nBig Bang Theory. The following, one of several such, comes from a popular work devoted to\nthe mysteries of the Bible:\n\u201cPrevailing scientific theory proposes that the universe was created in a flash of light.\nThis \u2018big bang,\u2019 or cosmic explosion, is believed to have occurred some 16 billion\nyears ago. Some see parallels between this modern, scientific theory and the biblical\naccount which opens with God\u2019s command, \u2018Let there be light\u2019.\u201d\u201d\u201d\nGranted, on its own, this similarity is not enough for one to claim that the theory in ques-\ntion had already been posited in a religious work. The Book of Genesis is not, however, the\nreligious work I have in mind. So bear with me for a while.\nGeorge Gamow is the acclaimed father of the Big Bang theory. But before Gamow there\nwas Georges Lemaitre who, in 1927, was the first to propose that a hot, dense, primeval\n\u201catom\u201d had exploded, flinging its contents outward to create the universe.\u201d With the advent\nOf the theory in question, Pope Pius XII himself had it stated that \u201cscientists are beginning to\nfind the finger of God in the creation of the universe.\u201d\"* Lemaitre, who was a Catholic priest\nbesides being a physicist, was later decorated by the Vatican for his scientific achieve-\nments.\nTo be quite fair, in developing his theory of the expanding universe, Lemaitre had relied\non the principles of general relativity. But, since he was also well versed in the discipline of\ntheology, could he not also have come across that great medieval commentary on Biblical\nScripture known as the Ramban? In 1990, in a book titled Genesis and the Big Bang, the Is-\nraeli nuclear physicist Gerald Schroeder argued in detail that there is no contradiction to be\nfound between the account of creation as described in Genesis and the current scientific dic-\ntum.\u201d\u00b0 Moreover, as Schroeder noted, \u201cthe Ramban ... had the remarkably modern insight\nthat at the moment after creation, all the matter in the universe must have been concentrated\nin a tiny speck.\u201d\u201d\u201d Tell me that this insight is not identical to that reached by Lemaitre?\nI hope no one will now think that I, personally, believe that Creation as described in\nGenesis is a veiled description of the Big Bang since, as I hope to demonstrate in a future\nwork, Ihave an entirely different theory to propose concerning the shedding of light by",

It is one thing to hypothesize, but quite another to uphold the hypothesis\u2014at\nleast Lemaitre had general relativity on which to rely. In this respect, David Leveson was\nshrewd enough to note: \u201cIn scientific as opposed to pseudo-scientific polemic, evidence has\npriority over hypothesis,\u201d adding that \u201chypothesis must conform to evidence, not evidence to\nhypothesis.\u201d And he goes on with: \u201cIf evidence contrary to a given hypothesis is found, the\nhypothesis must (or should) be altered or rejected.\u201d But then he was astute enough to warn\nthat: \u201cThis does not mean that when contrary evidence is found the hypothesis is immediately\nrejected; it may be retained tentatively in the hope that further evidence may eventually\nexplain the \u2018contrary\u2019 evidence in terms of the theory.\u201d\u201d* As he also pointed out:\nexplain the \u2018contrary\u2019 evidence in terms of the theory.\u201d\"\"* As he also pointed out:\n\u201cIndeed, many hypotheses are arrived at intuitively, through a \u2018flash of insight,\u2019 and\nmay be maintained in the mind of the investigator in spite of much initial \u2018contrary\u2019\nevidence, and later be vindicated ... But a legitimate researcher will not consciously\nsuppress contrary evidence. Certainly he will not publish a hypothesis until he has\nsatisfied himself that all the available evidence is in accord with it. Indeed, if he is\nproperly conscientious, he will search for contrary evidence to test the validity of his\nideas. Hypothesis may precede evidence in time but not in importance.\u201d\u201d\u201d\nThese are guidelines that will be kept in mind as we attempt to unravel the lost history of\nour Solar System in the pages that follow. But, even so, the question must be asked: What\nconstitutes evidence? As Daniel Trifiletti noted:\n\u201cThe very nature of evidence changes from one discipline of science to another. What\nis evidentiary to one person is excluded by another. Facts are not the same for every-\none. Since we cannot all agree as to what constitute \u2018facts,\u2019 deductive arguments\nalone can never be fully convincing...\n\u201cThere is another approach, however, for assessing what might be considered\n\u2018dubious\u2019 by some. That recourse is inductive reasoning. Let it be recognized that no\nfact stands alone, but is part of a whole constellation of other facts. At some point,\nwhen enough facts have been collected, each individual point of light may be seen as\npart of a newly recognizable figure\u2014an organic whole. Eventually the sheer weight\nof even \u2018dubious\u2019 facts becomes too large to ignore.\u201d\u2122\nTHE HISTORICITY OF THE EVENTS\nCan it, however, be assumed that the events portrayed in myths have any factual basis\none way or the other? Many a past mythologist has been vociferous in denying that any his-\ntoricity can be discerned in mythic content. Most mythologists continue to believe that myth,\non the one hand, deals with religious, that is moral, precepts presented in allegorical form,\nand, on the other hand, with such fabulous events that no scientifically-minded modern per-\nson can accept.

Where I disagree with him is when he states that\n\u201cto dwell on the historicity of the accounts, even only an historical core, is to stray from the\npurposes of the writings.\u201d He goes on with: \u201c[The accounts in Genesis] are not aimed at\nproviding a \u2018truer\u2019 picture of the universe or of human history, let alone the only true picture,\nin the modern scientific or historical senses of true.\u201d\u201d\u201d Personally, I refuse to be dubbed a\nfundamentalist,\u201d but I must also state that Hyers\u2019 disclaimer is mainly due to the fact that he\ndoes not understand what historical truths lie hidden within the pages of Genesis, a work\nwhich will hold a place of great importance in the pages to follow.\nMircea Eliade who, in his faltering way, has done more for comparative mythology than\nany other mythologist of the past, was of a slightly different opinion. To him, religious rites\nconsisted in \u201cthe repetition of an archetypal action performed in illo tempore (before\n\u201chistory\u201d began) by ancestors or by gods ... \u201d\u201d\n\u201cBy its repetition, the act coincides with its archetype, and time is abolished.

If, however, by \u201chistory\u201d we mean \u201cthe story\nof mankind,\u201d Eliade could not have been correct. This becomes of great importance when\none considers what else Eliade had to say about this subject. Thus, toward the end of the\nwork being cited, he states that:\n\u201cEvery ritual, and every meaningful act that man performs, repeats a mythical\narchetype; and ... this repetition involves the abolition of profane time and placing of\nman in a magico-religious time which has no connection with succession in the true\nsense, but forms the \u2018eternal now\u2019 of mythical time.

The \u201chistory\u201d / am speaking of, therefore, is a\ncosmogonic history, one that unfurled across the sky and touched Earth and its inhabitants\nwith a mighty finger that has left the human psyche scarred unto this day. The events that the\nmajor myths of the world narrate actually took place, and they took place very much in the\nway the myths narrate.\nWhat, then, is myth?\nI cannot for the life of me remember who said it, but someone, somewhere, once stated\nthat myth constitutes the fossilized memory of man. Truer words have rarely been spoken.\nBut this fossilized memory betokens a knowledge, a remembrance, of what once took place\nin heaven and, in that respect, it can safely be stated that myth constitutes the history of the\nSolar System.\nHere I can best illustrate the above by repeating a story that was well known to the an-\ncient Greeks. The story involves the god Helios\u2014usually identified as the personification of\nthe Sun*\u2019\u2014who was believed to drive his flaming chariot across the sky. When, once, He-\nlios told his son Phaethon that he could ask him for any boon, Phaethon replied by asking to\nbe allowed to drive his father\u2019s chariot. At first Helios, repenting of his oath, tried to dissuade\nPhaethon by stressing the dangers involved in driving the chariot. But, when Phaethon in-\nsisted, Helios, having given his word, was left with no recourse but to give in to his son.\nPhaethon, still in the pride of his youth, leaped into the chariot, took reins in hand, and began\non his journey. The steeds drawing the chariot, however, felt that the weight they were carry-\ning was too light and they leaped into the air as if the car was empty. This occasioned them to\nleave their usual well-beaten path, and Phaethon, who lacked his father\u2019s expertise, panicked,\nand, in trying to correct his erroneous course across the sky, pulled this way and that way at\nthe reins, confusing the horses further. Losing control of the chariot, Phaethon ended up\ndriving it too close to Earth with the result that Earth\u2019s moisture was dried up by the heat of\nthe chariot and, in due course, Earth caught fire and came close to being annihilated by the\nconflagration. In the end, Zeus himself was forced to intervene. Sending forth one of his ter-\nrible thunderbolts, he smote Phaethon with its might, shattering the chariot and freeing the\nhorses. The fragments of the wrecked car were scattered and Phaethon himself, with flames",

Not\nonly that, Peiser, who seems to have no use for planetary catastrophism himself, also warned\nus that the persistence of belief in planetary \u201cbilliards\u201d can only prove a hindrance to the\neventual acceptance of cosmic catastrophism. Peiser sees this face-about by astronomers and\ntheir allies as a positive step forward. As I told him then, unless planetary catastrophism was\nalso to be embraced as a valid possibility, at best the step in question can only be seen as be-\ning sideways.\nThe present state of affairs was uniquely displayed at the Second SIS Cambridge Confer-\nence, held in July 1997 at Fitzwilliam College, in Cambridge, in which the work of the as-\ntronomers Victor Clube and Bill Napier received quite a boost. Having kept the astronomical\npart of their cosmic scenario well within the bounds of accepted paradigms, not much can be",

        "content": "said for these two astronomers\u2019 interpretation of the mytho-historical record. In fact, as far as\ntheir book, The Cosmic Serpent, is concerned, it can safely be stated that they relied quite\nheavily on Immanuel Velikovsky\u2019s Worlds in Collision. Of course, Velikovsky dealt in plan-\netary catastrophism, whereas Clube and Napier re-interpreted Velikovsky\u2019s mytho-historical\nsources in light of cometary bombardments. They could not, of course, escape the fact that\nthe sources themselves stress the role of planets in lieu of comets. They got around this by\nthe supposition that planets were named as the perpetrators in lieu of comets because the\ncomets had first appeared close to the planets and thus received planetary names.\n\nEven so, the sudden interest in cosmic catastrophism among establishment science was\nnot influenced by the work of Clube, Napier, Velikovsky, or any of their predecessors in the\nfield, but was largely due to the insights derived from three separate events\u2014one ancient, the\nother two recent. The ancient event concerns the demise of the dinosaurs at the end of the\nCretaceous period (the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, actually) due to the terrestrial impact\nof a celestial body, which was first proposed by de Laubenfels in 1956,\u2122 twenty four years\nbefore the team headed by Luis Alvarez stole the credit for the hypothesis. At first described\nas \u201ca nutty theory of pseudoscientists posing as paleontologists,\u201d\u2122 the proposal has now\ngained general acceptance. Even so, because this event is supposed to have transpired mil-\nlions of years ago, it did not do much toward the gaining of respectability by cosmic catas-\ntrophism. In that respect, neither did the terrestrial impact of a heavenly bolide in the Tun-\nguska region of Siberia, which occurred on the morning of June 30, 1908, exploding in a\nblinding flash and flattening twenty-five square miles of the surrounding forest, since this,\ntoo, was considered an isolated case. Although the warning should have been clear, the event\ndid not attract much attention in the Western World until the late decades of the century. It\nwas, more than anything else, the most recent of these events, when Comet Shoemaker-Levy\n9, which had broken up into a train of twenty-one separate fragments, smashed into Jupiter\nduring the month of July in 1994. Had there been a slight deviation in the comet\u2019s orbit, all\ntwenty one pieces could have plowed into Earth. But even with this terrestrial miss, it be-\ncame painfully apparent that if a comet can smash into a nearby member of the Solar System,\nanother one could just as easily collide with Earth.\n\nAll of a sudden there was a flurry of activity among astronomers centered on the detec-\ntion, and possible elimination, of Earth-crossing objects, while geologists have gone wild in\ntheir attempt to discover previously unrecognized impact scars in our terrestrial terrain. His-\ntorians began pouring over historical, pseudo-historical, and mytho-historical documents in\nthe hope of discovering records of possible past impacts, while archaeologists started re-\nsifting the dust of ages to see what they might have missed among the scattered ruins of past\ncivilizations that might be interpreted as cometary, or asteroidal, destruction. So that, in a\nmanner of speaking, the writing of this book does not exactly place me in bad company\u2014but\nonly in a manner of speaking.\n\nComets plowing into Earth remain a far cry from planets shifting on their orbits\u2014that is\nif these shifts are maintained to have transpired during the advent of man on Earth. As\npointed out above, it was because of the supposed impossibility of such orbital shifts that the\nastronomers Clube and Napier thought it expedient to re-interpret the mytho-historical record\nin a cometary light, claiming that planets were named in the ancient records simply because\ncomets had appeared in close proximity to the planets and thus were given planetary names.\nAnd, to be fair, this is not exactly a spurious idea. Thus the Greeks were wont to refer to",

Such an objection would,\nhowever, be based on ignorance since the various civilizations whose mytho-historical re-\ncords we will soon be examining were actually quite knowledgeable when it came to obser-\nvational astronomy. A detailed exploration of this ancient astronomical lore would constitute\na book of its own. Thus, despite the length of this chapter, what is presented below consti-\ntutes only a brief account of the major astronomical discoveries made by our ancient forefa-\nthers.\nI will start with a topic that might be considered mundane\u2014meteors and meteorites.\nThese had been falling from the sky since time immemorial. Our primitive forebears would\nnot have been strangers to such falls. And, unlike the deification of planets, the sanctification\nof meteorites is more understandable. Meteors do not appear merely as pin-points of light in\nthe night sky. Even when they do, as shooting stars they leave a short-lived luminous streak\nin their wake. Every so often, veritable showers of these streaky flares seem to radiate from a\nlocal spot in the sky. When conditions permit, such showers can be quite impressive. More\nrarely, meteors roar in the shape of terrible fire balls through the sky, night or day. Their ex-\nplosive impact on the ground can be quite a frightening experience. Such events, when wit-\nnessed, must have awed our primitive ancestors. The occurrences would have been remem-\nbered with fear and even reverence.\nDepending on conditions, an impacting meteor may or may not form a crater. The meteor\nitself may be burned and atomized in its passage through Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Often enough,\nstony chunks or masses of iron remain on the ground as evidence of the bombardment. The\narrival, or apparent materialization, of such objects in places where fire balls were seen to\nstrike must have mystified primitive man to no little extent. Such objects, when found, would\nhave been thought to be magical, possessing benign or evil powers, if not both. It is under-\nstandable that such objects, now known as meteorites, would have been collected, preserved,\nand even revered. But we find that there was more than that. Lincoln La Paz put it succinctly\nr  |  Vhere will be some who might object that ancient civilizations had enough knowledge\nwhen he wrote:\n\u201cThe ancients supposed the stars to be the domicile of gods; falling stars and falling\nmeteorites signified to them either the actual descent of a god or the sending of his\nimage to earth.\u201d!\nThe worship of meteorites\u201d as images of the gods, however, could only have accrued\nfrom a prior belief that the gods resided in the sky in the form of stars.

But even this does not quite explain why certain\nmeteorites were associated with specific deities and, in some cases, with specific planets.\n\nOne thing to note here is that it can thus be seen that the ancients were well aware of the\nphenomenon. The Babylonians referred to meteors as Kakkabu rabu.\u2019 This recognition, how-\never, did not keep the ancient peoples of the Near East from attributing sanctity to meteorites.\nNor did it keep them from identifying them as images or pre-existing deities.*\n\nAmong the Semites, especially the ancient inhabitants of the Arabian peninsula, stones\nwere frequently credited with divine attributes.* These cults, as Hildegard Lewy indicated,\u00b0\nwere practiced by the same people who worshipped the visible planets. Philo Byblius tells us\nthat the Phoenicians considered meteorites as \u201cstars fallen from the air,\u201d and that these\nplayed a dominant role in the religion of his ancient forebears.\u2019 These meteorites, as Lewy\nstressed, \u201cwere conceived as divine beings of exactly the same nature as the planets.\u201d*\n\nA meteorite which fell at Tyre, in Syria, was associated with the goddess Astarte.\u201d What\nis of additional interest here is that, according to those very Phoenicians who venerated her,\nAstarte was the same as the Greek Aphrodite\u2019 and, therefore, like her, the goddess of the\nplanet Venus.\n\nAccording to a passage in the New Testament, one of the sacred images that was wor-\nshipped at Ephesus, and associated with Artemis/Diana, was believed to have fallen from the\nplanet Jupiter.\" The Syrian cultists of the god Elegabalus (or Gabal) \u201cfocused their worship\non a meteorite at the shrine of Emesa.\u201d\u201d A large, conical, black stone, this \u201cimage\u201d was later\ntransported by the emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, who assumed the name of his god, to\nthe temple of Kybele in Rome.\u201d Another famous meteorite which was held as sacred in this\nregion was the Magna Mater at Pessinus, in Asia Minor.\"* Worthy of mention was also the\nstone which fell at Abydos and was worshipped there. \u00b0\n\nAccording to the Egyptian priest Manetho, as quoted by Plutarch, the Egyptians consid-\nered lodestones to be the bones of the god Horus, while iron, in general, was believed to be\nthe bones of Set (which Plutarch rendered as Typhon).'\u00b0 Meteorites were venerated not only\nin honor of Set but also in honor of the great god Amon\u201d whom the Greeks, rightly or\nwrongly, identified with their own Zeus,\u201d and the Romans, quite naturally, with Jupiter.\n\nThe ancients were so well acquainted with meteorites that, before its discovery as an ore\nin the bowels of the Earth, they were of the belief that all iron fell from the sky.

A. Wainwright wrote in 1936:\n\u201cPlenty of [other meteorites] could be mentioned as being kept in churches or tem-\nples, but let that of Casa Grande suffice. It was found in a room of an ancient Mexi-\ncan temple carefully swathed in bandages.\u201d\nLet not the reader delude himself into thinking that such beliefs and practices were\nmerely the result of ancient and/or primitive naivet\u00e9. Modern-day Moslems might not care to\nadmit it, but the most holy object in all of Islam, the Black Stone, which today is incorpo-\nrated into the Ka\u2019aba at Mecca, is also a meteorite.\nHere it is only fair to point out that Immanuel Velikovsky\u2019s claim that the Black Stone\nwas believed to have fallen from the planet Venus\u00ae cannot be substantiated. Even so, there\nseems to be no doubt that the Black Stone \u201chad streaked out of the heavens one night in the\nforgotten past,\u201d and that it is nothing but a meteorite.\u201d\nThere has been some speculation that this meteorite had originally been reddish in hue\nand that its present black color is simply due to the patina of ages.* To my knowledge, this\nhas never been ascertained. In fact there is reason to believe that the Stone\u2019s blackness coin-\ncided with a special characteristic of mythic significance.\nThat the Ka\u2019aba was originally a shrine to the god and planet Saturn has now been docu-\nmented.\u201d Also, the myths and astronomical lore of various nations connect the color black\nwith this very planet and its deity.\u00a9 As Hildegard Lewy pointed out, \u201cSaturn is frequently\ncalled the \u2018black\u2019 or \u2018dark\u2019 planet.\u201d It is this particular Saturnian curiosity that points to the\nBlack Stone\u2019s selection as a Saturnian symbol. As Lewy wrote:\n\u201cAs,..this Black Stone was revered in a sanctuary dedicated to the cult of the \u2018Black\nPlanet\u2019 Saturn, we comprehend that a black meteorite, or a black stone resembling a\nmeteorite, was thought to be a piece of the \u2018Black Planet,\u2019 which means a part of the",

Having done so, he concluded that nothing of the sort could have tran-\nspired and that all those who were said to have witnessed the event had either been mistaken\nor lying.\u201d The reasoning was simple: As that indomitable arch-enemy of establishment sci-\nence, Charles Fort, put it, since there were no stones in the sky to start with, no stones could\nhave fallen from the sky.*\nBecause of such episodes, many European museums ended up discarding genuine mete-\norites, which would have been of great benefit to the scientific world in later years, simply\nbecause they thought of them \u201cas shameful relics of a superstitious past.\u201d\u201d One meteorite\nfrom that era, however, was preserved \u201cdue to the protection given to it by the bishop of\nZagreb\u2019s consistory.\u201d This was the iron meteorite which had fallen at Hraschina in 1751.\nSworn statements by eye-witnesses were collected and, together with the iron fragment, were\nsent to the Austrian emperor. Eventually, both the documents and the meteorite came into the\npossession of the Vienna museum and the attention of the physicist E. F. F. Chladni who\ncommenced on a battle against the scientific establishment. In his paper of 1794, Chladni de-\nfended the trustworthiness of the Hraschina and other meteorites and was bold enough to\nclaim that these objects originated as cosmic debris which had penetrated Earth\u2019s atmosphere\nand fallen to the ground. Most of his colleagues, however, remained skeptical.\u201d\nBut then, in 1803, so many of the damned things fell and landed on the ground\u2014an entire\nshower of meteorites actually\u2014that the new investigator, Jean Baptiste Biot, had no option\nbut to accept their extraterrestrial  origin. Even so, when, in 1807, two Yale scientists\nclaimed that meteorites had recently struck the ground at Weston, Connecticut, disbelief was\nstill rampant. Thus, when Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States, \u201cwho included\npalaeontology among his many interests,\u201d was told of the incident, he is reported to have re-\nplied that: \u201cIt is easier to believe that two Yankee professors would lie, than that stones\nwould fall from heaven.\u201d >\nwould fall from heaven.\u201d *\nThere is a lesson to be learned here because, since the ancients, who had been reporting\nthe fall of such objects, swaddling them, worshipping them, etcetera, have been proven right\non this score, they should perhaps be given the benefit of the doubt concerning their reports\nof other astronomical occurrences which science has not yet had reason to accept as being\nvalid.\nCALENDARS\nThe Mesoamerican Indians have gained the reputation of having been one of the most\nastronomically-oriented peoples of the ancient world. This is stressed here because the unini-\ntiated has a tendency to perceive the Mesoamerican Indians as having been a primitive tribe\nof people, adorned in colorful costumes and exotic feathered headdresses, whose brutal re-\nligion incorporated human sacrifice on a massive scale. Other than their description as primi-\ntive, the above holds true. But these Indians had also been capable of constructing monu-",

It was not, however,\nmerely the priesthood which was obsessed with such lore but, as Juan de Torquemada re-\ncorded a century after the Spanish conquest of Mexico, even kings. Of Netzahualpilli, the\nking of Texcoco, he had this to report:\n\u201cThey say he was a great astrologer and prided himself much on his knowledge of the\nmotions of the celestial bodies; and being attached to this study, that he caused in-\nquiries to be made throughout the entire extent of his dominions, for all such persons\nas were at all conversant with it, whom he brought to his court, and imparted to them\nwhatever he knew, and ascending by night on the terraced roof of his palace, he\nthence considered the stars, and disputed with them all on difficult questions con-\nnected with them.\u201d*\nIt is obvious from the pictorial elements included in various codices that pyramid-tem-\nples, as well as other structures, were utilized as astronomical observation posts. One of these\ncodices even shows a priest stationed in a temple doorway, peering through a cross-piece to\nobserve a celestial event. In fact, the symbol of an eye located within, or in conjunction with,\nsuch cross-pieces appear on other codices which treat of astronomical matters, thus indicat-\ning that this simple instrument was the one most frequently used in astronomical observa-\ntions.*\ntions.\nGranted, most, although not all, of Mesoamerican astronomical knowledge is calendric in\nnature. It might therefore be countered that, since calendars are the outcome of solar and lu-\nnar motions, one should not be all that impressed with their knowledge. After all, as complex\nas they are, the motions of the Sun and the Moon are more observable than the fall of mete-\norites. The computation of such systems is not, however, all that easily determined. After all,\nthe calendar we presently use in the Western World was not computed until 1582.\nThe Mesoamericans\u2019 mathematical abilities, especially when it came to the calculation of\ntime-periods and, quite naturally, the formulation of calendars (of which they possessed more\nthan one), formed the dictatorial power that held sway over Maya life. The vigesimal system\nthey employed\u2014that is, a progression by twenties rather than by tens as in our decimal sys-\ntem\u2014enabled them to conduct complex calculations in their studies of astronomical phe-\nnomena. They understood, and utilized, the concept of zero a thousand years before Europe-\nans did. They learned how to accurately predict eclipses and were able to tabulate the mo-\ntions of the planet Venus with a precision that has stunned modern astronomers. The Dresden\nCodex, for example, gives a total of 11,960 days for 405 lunar cycles which, when compared\nto the modern value of 11,959.89 days, discloses an error of only one day every 380 years.*\nI will not here tax the reader\u2019s patience with a detailed scrutiny of Mesoamerican calen-\ndars with all their complex calculations. Even so, a brief survey would not be amiss.",

For this, they probably used a gno-\nmon, a kind of sight made with only a vertical rod.

Developed in the fourteenth century B.C., the calen-\ndar passed on to the Olmec of the Gulf Coast and, from there, to the Maya in the east and the\nplateau of Mexico in the west.\u00ae Whether Malmstrom has come across a red herring, and/or\nwhether Mayanists will ever accept his conclusions, as of this writing remains to be seen.\nOne thing that can be stated for certain is that the synchronization of this calendar with the\n360-day one occurred once every 18,980 days, which makes for 52 years.\u00ae This is the same\ntime period we have already encountered as separating the ceremony known as the Binding\nof the Years which began at the midnight transit of the Pleiades constellation.\n\nThe Mesoamericans also devised a lunar calendar which fitted into their other time-\nkeeping devices. The lunar r period of 29.53 days that they obtained contained a mere discrep-\nancy of only .112 of a day.\n\nThe Dresden Codex not only includes the perpetual lunar calendar mentioned above, but\nalso a table of new moons to be used for the prediction of solar eclipses.\u201d\n\nVENUS\n\nOf all the celestial bodies that the Mesoamericans observed, the planet Venus seems\nwithout doubt to have been considered the most important. Called, among other things, the\nGreat, or Ancient, Star, it is repeatedly alluded to in the extant codices. Ram\u00e9n y Zamora,\nwho studied the lore of the Mexican tribes only a few decades after the re-discovery of\nAmerica, was astounded to discover that the Indians kept a precise record of the appearances\nof this planet. \u201cSo accurately did they keep the record of the days when it appeared and dis-\nappeared,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat they never made a mistake.\u201d\u201d Toribo Motolina added that \u201cthey\nknew on what day it would appear again in the east after it had lost itself or disappeared in\nthe west\u201d and that \u201cthey counted the days by this star and yielded reverence and offered sac-\nrifices to it.\u201d\u201d\n\nThe Dresden Codex of the Maya includes a complete record of the apparition of this\nplanet in its cycle from Moming to Evening Star, recorded in the dot and bar mathematical\nsymbols which they employed (in which a dot signifies 1, and a bar stands for 5, with an\noval\u2014a stylized seashell, really\u2014for the concept of zero). Intervals indicating the elapsed\ntime between successive heliacal risings are there recorded. This interval of time was calcu-\nlated by them as a period of 584 days which the Maya subdivided into four subintervals: the\nappearance of the planet as Morning Star; its appearance as Evening Star; its disappearance\nin front of the Sun; and its disappearance behind the Sun.\u2122\n\nVenus takes 224.7 days to complete one circuit around the Sun. As seen from Earth,\nhowever, it appears to take 583.92 days to complete one circuit. This is because Earth, too, is\nmoving in the same direction. This apparent time-span is known as the synodic period. As\nnoted above, the Mesoamericans calculated the Venerian synodic year as 584 days,\u201d which,\nwhen compared to the modern value of 583.92 days, discloses an error of less than one hour",

It is easily forgotten by the\nlayman that one cannot easily view the Sun directly without some form of optic protection\nexcept during its risings and settings. Of course, it could also be argued that the Chinese, who\nwere so adept at just about everything, could have utilized dark, or smoked, glass in order to\nenable them to view sunspots. Actually, not even a smoked glass would have been necessary.\nDespite the fact that the Sun cannot be viewed directly for any length of time with the un-\naided eye, it can be viewed indirectly when it is shielded by haze or thin clouds. As John\nGribbin noted, it is hardly surprising that those Chinese records which mention sunspots\n\u201cvery often comment at the same time that the brightness of the Sun was reduced.\u201d As\nGribbin explained: \u201cThis does not imply that the Sun itself was dim, but that dust or haze in\nthe atmosphere was obscuring its light and making it possible to pick out the spots against the\nglare of the solar disk.\u201d\u00ae Had sunspots been as easily detected with the unaided eye as some\nwould think, it would not, in Europe, have taken till the early seventeenth century for them to\nbe re-discovered. One of the reasons why Galileo was persecuted by the Catholic Church was\nhis insistence that the Sun often exhibits such blemishes on its surface. Prior to that, one of\nthe central dogmas of the Church was that the Sun, having been created by God, had to be a\nperfect sphere. \u201c[S]uggesting imperfection in the Sun was seen in some quarters as implying\nthat God could be fallible and was guilty of shoddy workmanship.\u201d\u201d\u201d And yet, even before\nthe Chinese, sunspots had long been known to the ancient Greeks.\nTHE ETERNAL PLANET\nThe caliber of ancient Chinese astronomy can inter alia be judged by what the imperial\nastronomers were able to discover about the planets. Here I do not wish to bore the lay reader\nwith too many technicalities, so I will merely zero in on what the Chinese had to say con-\ncerning the planet Saturn, the astronomical name of which was T\u2019ien-Sing, which means\n\u201cEternal Planet.\u201d The slowness of this body in its course around the Sun, for instance, was\ndescribed by them in this manner:\n\u201cThis planet, with its slow and heavy walk, imitating age, drags itself along its path,\nin a manner of speaking; before finishing its revolution, it had seen a great number of\nmen die whom it had seen being born, so slow was its pace.\u201d\u00ae",

The most fa-\nmous of such temporary Chinese Guest Stars was the one that took place in 1054 A.D., a su-\npernova that is now believed to have given birth to the Crab Nebula.\n\nTHE SURYA SIDDHANTA\n\nOf Hindu astronomical knowledge I will say nothing beyond a few facts as contained in\nthe Surya Siddhanta which, among other matters, presents the correct view that Earth is a\nsphere. As it is there written: \u201cAnd everywhere upon the globe of the earth, men think their\nown place to be uppermost\u2014 but since it is a globe in the ether, where should there be an up-\nper, or where an under side of it?\u201d* Aryabhatta even held the opinion that Earth revolves on\nits axis.\n\nOne should read the section of the Surya Siddhanta which treats of planetary conjunc-\ntions, that is the apparent contact of one planet with another as seen with the naked eye\nagainst the background of stars, in order to obtain some measure of understanding concerning\nthe painstaking observations and calculations that these early astronomers were capable of. A\ndifferent term is there employed for different conjunctions.* These apparent close ap-\nproaches of planets were correctly understood in a purely angular sense\u2014that is, they were\nquite aware that the planets appeared to touch each other only when they happened to lie in\nthe same line of sight as seen from Earth.\u201d\n\nVelikovsky was thus completely in error when he proposed that these conjunctions re-\nferred to actual physical contacts between planets.\u201d This is evidenced by the work in ques-",

Thibaut has claimed that much of what is found contained in the Hindu Siddhantas, of\nwhich there is more than one, is mainly based on the teachings of the Greek Hipparchos\nand/or Ptolemy. Otto Neugebauer and D. Pingree also trace some of this Hindu knowledge to\nthe even older Babylonians. We therefore turn next to Greece and, after that, to Babylon.\n\nTHE ALMAGEST\n\nClaudius Ptolemaeus, popularly known simply as Ptolemy, was the most celebrated geog-\nrapher, mathematician, and astronomer prior to medieval times. More than that, he has often\nbeen referred to as \u201cthe greatest astronomer of antiquity.\u201d Unfortunately, despite some\nArabian traditions concerning his personal appearance and the report that he lived to the ripe\nold age of 78 years, nothing much is known about the man himself. Whether his name,\nPtolemaeus, derived from that of the Greek city in which he was said to have been born,\nPtolemais Hermii, or whether, as Kenneth Heuer assumes, it \u201cindicates that he was an in-\nhabitant of Egypt of Greek or Macedonian [that is, Ptolemaic] descent,\u201d cannot now be as-\ncertained.\n\nWhat seemed to have been certain until recently is that he conducted his astronomical ob-\nservations at Alexandria, in Egypt, sometime during the years 127 and 141 or 151 A.D. The\nbelief among more modern historians of science, however, is that Ptolemy conducted most of\nhis observing \u201cnot at night on the coast of Egypt but during the day in the great library at Al-\nexandria, where he appropriated the work of a Greek astronomer [Hipparchus] and proceeded\nto call it his own.\u201d\n\nOf his works on geography and mathematics, I shall say nothing here, concentrating in-\nstead, and then only briefly, on his astronomical observations and theories. These were pre-\nsented in thirteen books originally titled Syntaxis, but later referred to by the Arabs as Al-\nmagest, which means \u201cThe Greatest,\u201d the name by which the work is now more commonly\nalluded to. For better or worse, this work \u201cwas accepted as the final authority on the subject\nuntil it was superseded by the observations of the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus in\nthe 16th century.\u201d\"\u201d\n\nWhat Ptolemy concluded from his so-called observations of the heavens was that the\nheavenly bodies moved in circular orbits and that Earth, already known by then to be spheri-\ncal in shape, was at the centre of the universe. He calculated the periods of revolution, as well\nas the apparent retrogradation, of the five planets visible to the unaided eye, the inclination of\ntheir orbits, and their motions in latitude. He compiled a catalogue of the stars visible in both\nthe northern and southern hemispheres, listed under constellations, giving their apparent\nmagnitudes, latitudes, and longitudes, which stars numbered 1,022 (some say 1,025) as\ncompared with the 850 or so that were contained in the earlier catalogue of Hipparchus.\n\nMuch of the Almagest is taken up with an explanation of astronomical assumptions and\nmathematical methods; the length of the year and the motion of the Sun; the length of the\nmonth and the motions of the Moon; the sizes and distances of the Sun, the Moon, and Earth\nitself; eclipses of the Sun and the Moon; and the precession of the equinoxes.",

Let not the reader, however, disqualify Ptolemy as an\nincompetent astronomer because of his astrological beliefs. Isaac Newton was not only a be-\nliever in alchemy, he himself attempted to change base metals into silver and gold. '\u00ae\nAs Heuer informed his readers, \u201cPtolemy was not the kind of genius who produced new\nideas; he took existing ideas and changed and extended them in order to obtain agreement\nwith observed facts.\u201d\u2122 There is no doubt, however, that a large part of the theories he\npresents are his own contributions \u201cbased on observations of his own, not to speak of the\nunbelievable number of numerical calculations which underlie the tables of the Almagest.\u201d\"\u00ae\nSome of Ptolemy\u2019s modern defenders have been claiming that his \u201csystem\u201d has been\nmuch misunderstood by astronomers as well as historians of astronomy. As Irving Wolfe\npointed out:\n\u201c...the theory of Ptolemy was not presented in its time as a real picture of the sky.\nAstrophysicist Bruce Gregory reminds us that Ptolemy\u2019s model was not said to be a\nminiature of the Solar System, as we use the word today. It was \u2018a device for\ncalculating the position of the planets, not a device for representing the appearance of\nthe planets.\u2019 Astonishingly, the theory of Copernicus was first presented in the\nsame way, as a system which \u2018might not be the true scheme of nature, but merely a\nmathematical fiction which fitted the observations.\u2019'\u201d Ptolemy\u2019s system, however,\nwas soon elevated to absolute truth, as was Copernicus\u2019 later, so it is we who have\nmade them into religions.\u201d '\u00ae\nMaybe so, even though, to me, this sounds more like an attempt to whitewash Ptolemy\u2019s\nimage. Thus, for instance, those astronomers who have more recently re-examined Ptolemy\u2019s\noriginal data soon realized that retrocalculations of the planets proved that many of\nPtolemy\u2019s so-called observations were wrong. \u201cThe errors were gross even by the standards\nof ancient astronomy.\u201d There is also no longer any doubt that Ptolemy plagiarized the\nwork of the earlier Hipparchus. We have already noted the earlier star catalogue compiled by\nHipparchus who conducted his observations from the island of Rhodes. This Greek island\nlies five degrees of latitude north of Alexandria. This makes for a five-degree band of\nsouthern stars that can be seen from Alexandria but not from Rhodes. Not a single one of the\n1,022 stars that Ptolemy listed in his catalogue is to be found in this five-degree band.\nMoreover, \u201cevery example given in the Almagest of how to work out spherical astronomy\nproblems is given for a latitude the same as that of Rhodes.\u201d!\u201d\nRobert Newton went even further:",

How\nsuperior was it to that espoused by Ptolemy?\nTHE HELIOCENTRIC SYSTEM\nMany an authority on the subject of ancient Greek astronomy has in years past stressed\nthe primitive nature of their knowledge. Many of them have relied on the oft-repeated dictum\nthat \u201cthe world according to Homer\u201d consisted of a round, but flat, Earth overarched by a\nsemi-spherical sky in which the gods had fashioned their various domains. But even as early\nas 1881, apparently to the unconcern of various authorities who came after him, Simon New-\ncomb had already warned against this erroneous belief. As he wrote:\n\u201cNot enough credit has been given to the ancient astronomers. For instance, there was\nno time within the scope of history when it was not known that the earth is a sphere,\nand that the direction down at different points is toward the same point at the earth\u2019s\ncentre. Current teaching in the text-books as to the knowledge of astronomy by the\nancients is at fault.\u201d\"\u00b0\nThe discovery that the Sun, rather than Earth, was the body at the center of the Solar\nSystem has for long been attributed to the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Koppernigk, popularly\nknown as Copernicus (1473-1543).

Then, knowing the distance\nbetween Syene and Alexandria, which was measured at 5,000 stadia, and using some simple\ngeometry, he realized that this was 7\u00b0, or close to 1/50 of a great circle. He thus arrived at the\nfigure of 250,000 stadia, which he subsequently corrected to 252,000 stadia, as the circum-\nference of Earth. When translated into miles or kilometers, his result was only a few percent\noff the mark.\nIt was on thus discovering the vastness of the world he lived on that Eratosthenes became\nconvinced of the immensity of the universe.\nINCLINATION TO THE SOUTH\nThe Greeks were also aware that Earth\u2019s axis was inclined, and that it was inclined \u201cto-\nward the south.\u201d As Plutarch wrote:\n\u201cDiogenes and Anaxagoras affirm that, after the world was composed and the earth\nhad produced living creatures, the world out of its own propensity made an inclina-\ntion towards the south.\u201d\nUnfortunately, Plutarch, bless his soul, was not only not an astronomer, he was not much\nof a geographer either. So he did make something of a mess when it came to explaining the\nreasons behind Earth\u2019s inclination and, especially, when he attempted to account for its ef-\nfects. On the other hand, come to think of it, perhaps Plutarch should not be blamed too much\nfor these misunderstandings since, in some instances, he actually claimed that he was but re-\npeating what others had asserted. '\u201d\nTHE PRECESSION OF THE EQUINOXES\nBesides being inclined, Earth\u2019s axis spins in a strange fashion which has often been com-\npared to that of a spinning top. Rather than rotating in a rigid manner, Earth\u2019s axis also wob-\nbles in such a way that its imaginary tip describes a circle of its own. In effect, the axis pre-\ncesses around the vertical so that it traces out a cone in space. This additional axial rotation\nthus causes an apparent shift of the stars, as viewed from Earth, which is different from the\napparent daily revolution of the stars around the pole. Whereas the daily rotation causes the\nstars to seem to revolve around the Pole Star, precession causes the Pole Star itself to revolve\nin a circle of 231/2\u00b0 radius. Thus, throughout the years, the Pole Star is seen to shift and leave\nthe north celestial pole. If another star is then in the right position, it becomes the new Pole\nStar. At present, the Pole Star is alpha Ursae Minoris, but, at the time of the Greek astrono-\nmers we are presently concerned with, it would have been beta Ursae Minoris. In 3000 B.C.,\nit would have been alpha Draconis. It was not just the pole stars, however, that slowly\n\u201cpassed away,\u201d but the entire sky and, with it, its entire denizens. This movement, however,\nis very slow in execution, requiring 26,000 years in order to complete one full circle. The\nmotion does not, therefore, lend itself to easy detection. Nor, for that matter, does the resul-\ntant change\u2014except over thousands of years. Needless to say, no one person can live long\nenough to detect the change. And yet, not only was this change detected, so was the preces-\nsional motion that gives rise to it. The discovery is attributed to one of the greatest astrono-",

The prize for the cognition of what lies behind precession, however, remains his.\n\nThis is not to say that others have not vied for the fame\u2014even if in retrospect and\nthrough modern proxy. None of these attempts have, however, withstood the test of scrutiny.\n\nTHE CRIME OF ANAXAGORAS\n\nAnaxagoras (500-428 B.C.) was the first to clearly state that the Moon shines with the re-\nflected light from the Sun, from which he devised a theory concerning the phases of the\nMoon. At the time, as with Galileo much later, this doctrine, which was not in keeping with\nthe prejudices of the day, was so dangerous that the manuscript in which Anaxagoras set out\nthese theories had to be circulated in secrecy. A century later, Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), a\ngreat mind in some matters, not so in others, was to argue that the Moon exhibited phases\nand that eclipses occurred simply because that was the nature of Earth\u2019s satellite\u2014which, as\nSagan succinctly put it, was \u201can explanation that explains nothing.\u201d'\u201d\n\nAnaxagoras also believed that the Sun and the stars were hot. While this was evident for\nthe Sun, it was not, as it still is not, for the stars. When asked why we do not feel the heat of\nthe stars, he replied correctly that it was because they were too far away. When he calculated\nthe Sun to be larger than the Peloponnesus, which constitutes about a third of Greece, his es-\ntimate was thought to be \u201cexcessive and absurd.\u201d!\u201d\n\nHe knew that the Moon harbored mountains (although he also believed it harbored life).\n\nIn the end, again much like Galileo, Anaxagoras was charged, convicted, and imprisoned\nfor impiety, mainly because he had taught that the Moon consisted of ordinary, and not di-\nvine, matter. It took Pericles, the great Athenian leader, to engineer Anaxagoras\u2019 release from\nprison.\n\nSHADOWS THROUGH SPACE\n\nThales, who lived toward the end of the 7th century B.C., has been lauded by his own an-\ncient countrymen as having been the first astronomer. Diogenes Laertius stated that Thales\nwas first to receive the name of sage; that he was first to study astronomy and predict\neclipses of the Sun and fix the solstices; was first to make a number of specific observations\nrelating to the Sun and the Moon; was said to have \u201cdiscovered\u201d the seasons and to have di-\nvided the year into 365 days.'\u201d According to others, he was also the first, rather than the\nabove mentioned Anaxagoras, to realize that the Moon was actually illuminated by the\nSun.\n\nThales is also said to have recognized and to have predicted the solstices; to have been\nthe first to discover the passage of the Sun from one solstice to another; and to realize that\nthis cycle was not always of equal length, but that, on the contrary, there were \u201cslight varia-\ntions in length of the solar seasons as divided by solstices and equinoxes.\u201d\"\"",

D. R. Dicks, for one, has insisted that Thales' reputation in having been the\nfirst Greek astronomer comes from later, unreliable, sources, and that, therefore, no validity\nshould be applied to these claims.'* And while Mullen has found reason to question the evi-\ndence that Dicks relied on, the evidence he himself presented is, at best, circumstantial. '*\nThose who have sought to devalue Thales\u2019 reputation have also questioned his ability to\npredict eclipses. Both Plutarch\u2019 and Pliny (A.D. 23-79)\" knew that lunar eclipses were\ncaused by the projection of Earth\u2019s shadow on the lunar surface. The passage of the Moon\nacross the face of the Sun during a solar eclipse would have been more evident, so that it\nwould also have been known that the Moon cast its shadow on earth during such an occur-\nrence.\u201d Even so, knowing what causes a lunar, or solar, eclipse is one thing; being able to\npredict either of them is quite another.\nMeanwhile, quite a number of ancient sources, including Herodotus, have claimed that\nThales predicted an eclipse which took place during the battle between the Medes under\nCyaxares and the Lydians under Alyattes.'\"* This has led historians to set the date of that\nbattle at 585 B.C. Benny Peiser, on the other hand, has claimed that \u201cThales could not have\npossessed the knowledge necessary to predict eclipses in general.\u201d\u2019\u201d In this, he might not\nhave been entirely correct. As van der Waerden had earlier noted:\n\u201cSuch a feat requires the experience of more than forty years, no matter how one pro-\nceeds. It is not possible to accomplish it alone. But Thales had no Greek predecessors.\nThe conclusion is inescapable that he must have drawn upon the experience of Ori-\nental astronomers.\u201d\nBesides, when it comes to the eclipse that is said to have occurred at the time of the battle\nbetween the Medes and the Lydians, a close look at what Herodotus reported tells us that,\nwhile Thales did predict the year of this eclipse, he said nothing concerning the actual date,\nthe time of day, or the place from which it would have been visible. As various scholars have\nnoted, knowledge and a correct understanding of eclipse cycles should have enabled Thales\nto predict the eclipse in question by the day, and not just the year.'\"\nIn his attempt to retain, or regain, Thales\u2019 reputation, Mullen has noted that none of the\nscholarly arguments denying Thales the capacity to predict eclipses and other celestial occur-\nrences \u201cis sufficient to prove that Thales did not begin an inquiry into each of these phenom-",

Thus | mention all this\nspecifically to stem the possible accusation that I have taken every statement of the ancients\nas being necessarily true.\nTHE METONIC CYCLE\nThe reconciliation of the motions of the Sun with those of the Moon was required by an-\ncient societies in an endeavor to pin-point their seasonal festivals. Most Greek festivals were\nheld at full moon with certain ceremonies to be held in certain months. The months, there-\nfore, needed to be reconciled with the year. But since twelve lunations fall somewhat short of\nthe solar year, an extra month had to be added to the year every so often.\nAccording to Geminos of Rhodes, who wrote sometime in the first century B.C., such a\nsystem of intercalation was already in use \u201csome time before the second half of the fifth\ncentury B.C.\u201d'\u00ae The earliest such intercalation by the Greeks that has come down to us in-\nvolved the supplementing of 96 lunar months through an 8-year period, a cycle they called\noctaeteris, with the addition of leap years every third, fifth, and eighth years by inserting an\nextra month into each of them.\u201c\nBy the fifth century B.C., however, it had been realized that this 8-year cycle was not all\nthat accurate. The small difference between 99 months (the 96 plus the 3 of the leap years)\nand the 8 years into which they tried to fit them accumulated as the years went by so that the\nintegration of the solar and lunar motions was thrown off balance.\nIt was the Athenian astronomer Meton who then realized that the Moon returned to the\nsame position in relation to the Sun every 19 years\u2014or so Geminos had it stated, for which\nreason the system has, to this day, been called the Metonic cycle. This cycle works better\nthan the 8-year one because 19 years equal 235 lunations almost exactly.\u2019\nIn actual fact, however, there are indications that the Babylonians had been using this 19-\nyear cycle some one hundred years earlier. The Chinese also seem to have known about it,\nalthough it cannot be ascertained just how early the relationship was discovered and/or bor-\nrowed. Known as the chang, dates separated by multiples of 19 years are known from in-\nscriptions on Shang dynasty oracle bones.\nDiodorus Siculus also quoted a no-longer extant work by Hecateus of Abdera who also\nmentioned this 19-year return of the Moon and that it was known to the Hyperboreans who\ninhabited an island \u201cnot smaller than Sicily\u201d which was located \u201copposite to the coast of\nCeltic Gaul,\u201d which could only have been Britain.\u201d\nIn Tibet, the year is counted as 360 days with the addition of seven intercalary months\nover a 19-year interval set up to keep the phases of the Moon in step with the solar year and\nthe seasons.\u2019\u201d It is not known, however, how old this system is.\nA MATTER OF GRAVITY\nIsaac Newton owes his prestige in the world of science to his theory of gravity as pro-\npounded in his Principia.

S. Kennedy has shown, however, Arabian astrology already knew all that.'* Earlier\nstill, the Neoplatonist Olympiodorus (6th century A.D.) knew, and wrote, that one revolution\nof Jupiter took twelve years (modern calculation: 11.86) and that of Saturn was accomplished\nin thirty years (modern calculation: 29.46 years).\n\u201cFor if the sphere of Jupiter comes from the same to the same in twelve years, but that\nof Saturn in thirty years, it is evident that when Jupiter has made five, Saturn will\nhave made two revolutions: for twice thirty is sixty, and so likewise is twelve times\nfive; so that their revolutions will be conjoined in sixty years.\u201d\"*\nTHE PERIODICITY OF COMETS\nIt has often been stated that ancient historical documents, to say nothing of mythological\nones, have nothing to offer as far as modern astronomy is concerned.

He had no Pericles to save him from\nthose in authority. In A.D. 1600, Bruno was burned alive at the stake by the Catholic Inquisi-\ntion for espousing the belief, among other things, that other worlds must necessarily harbor\nother life. The belief that life exists on other planets did not, however, originate with him. As\nfar back as the fourth century B.C., Metrodorus of Chios had already written that: \u201cTo con-\nsider the Earth the only populated world in infinite space is as absurd as to assert that in an\nentire field sown with seed, only one grain will grow.\u201d'\u201d\nTHE BABYLONIAN PRECEDENCE\nWe have come a long way in analyzing the astronomical knowledge of ancient peo-\nples\u2014from eye-witness reports of meteors and the metallic structure of meteorites to the cor-\nrect motions of the heavenly bodies; from the calculation of complex calendrical systems to\nthe prediction of solar and lunar eclipses; from the intricacies of Mesoamerican computations\nto the Greek passion for exactitude and philosophical daring. I therefore hope that when, in\nthe following chapters, the main thesis of this work is revealed, no one will counter its reve-\nlations by objecting that the ancients had very little astronomical knowledge at their disposal\nto be taken seriously.\nIt is, moreover, accepted that this ancient knowledge was not necessarily the property of\nthe masses. Nor was it all necessarily adhered to by every scholar of the time. The man in the\nstreet, always prone to age-old superstitions, had little mind of astronomical matters. But, to\nan extent, this was not much different than it is at present.\nMeanwhile, competing theoreticians were very often contradicted by others. Plutarch, for\ninstance, delighted in enumerating the various and contradictory theories concerning the na-\nture of comets, some of which theories were hilarious even by the standards of his day. And,\nas we have seen, while the Greeks were quite aware of Earth\u2019s axial tilt, they fell far short\nwhen it came to explaining the reason behind it.\nCan it, however, be said that all modern astronomers agree on each and every astronomi-\ncal issue, or that some of their theories have not been, or will not be, found to be in error?\nWhy should we expect more stringent standards from our ancient forebears? Have we not\nalready seen that many of the great astronomical break-throughs and theories\u2014even that\nconcerning the Big Bang \u2014were originally discovered, or thought of, by these very ancients?\nIt is no secret\u2014and it never has been\u2014that the Greeks learned, and borrowed, much of\ntheir astronomical knowledge from the Babylonians. Nor, unlike many of their modern\ncounterparts, did they ever try to hide the fact. As Alexander Jones noted: \u201cThe Greek as-",

Thus, for instance, where the Greeks saw a scorpion in the constellation Scor-\npio, so had the Babylonians before them. Where the Greeks saw twins in the constellation\nGemini, so had the Babylonians before them.\nPeter James has even indicated \u201csome specific linguistic borrowing\u201d in this context.\nTake, for instance, the constellation which the Greeks called Pegasus. To the Sumerians and\nAkkadians this group of stars was known as Iku, a word that meant \u201cfield.\u201d Why, then, did\nthe Greeks see a horse in this constellation had they really borrowed their lore from them?\nThis misnomer, according to James, probably stems from the fact that, in Greek, igo, which\nsounds much like iku , used to mean \u201chorse\u201d \u2014as recorded on the Linear B Tablets\u2014before\nthe word hippos was later adopted. If this is true, it would also mean that the borrowing of\nBabylonian astronomical knowledge by the Greeks \u201chad already begun in Mycenaean\ntimes,\u201d\u201d\u201d to which the Linear B Tablets belong.\nIt is known that Democritus \u201cspent some time in the East and his astronomic ideas were\ndefinitely Babylonian.\u201d '\u2122 So, also, with Hipparchus, who based much of his findings on\nBabylonian records. Here is what G. J. Toomer had to say about the subject:\n\u201cIt has always been known that Hipparchus derived material from Babylonian astron-\nomy. A considerable number of Babylonian observations are quoted in Ptolemy\u2019s Al-\nmagest (which is the principal source of our knowledge of Hipparchus\u2019 work), and\nsome of these are explicitly said to have been used by Hipparchus. But it is only in the\npresent [20th] century, with the decipherment and interpretation of the relevant cu-\nneiform texts, that his debt to Mesopotamian sources was more fully revealed.\u201d\n\u201cThus, although our information about Hipparchus\u2019 work is largely secondhand and\nfragmentary, his extensive knowledge of both the observational and theoretical parts\nof Babylonian astronomy is beyond any doubt.\u201d\"\u201d\nAs James pointed out:",

All that they recorded, he has con-\ncluded, \u201chas actually happened in the sky.\u201d As far as he was concerned, the old Babylonian\neclipse data can be used with confidence. As he wrote: \u201cComparison of modern calculations\nwith the Babylonian eclipse records gives an excellent figure for the average rate of length-\nening of the day over the past 2500 years.\u201d In fact, he went out of his way to inform his read-\ners how Babylonian astronomical records were proving useful to modern astronomers in cal-\nculating changes in the length of the day. He did, of course, discover a statistical uncertainty\nof 1.78 milliseconds per century, but, as he explained, this \u201carises not so much from inaccu-\nracies in the Babylonian measurements but more from uncertainties in the modern estimates\nof the rate of expansion of the Moon\u2019s orbit.\u201d\"\"\n\nThe Assyro-Babylonians, or Chaldeans as Diodorus Siculus called them, already knew\nthat the planetary system was a dynamic one. As Diodorus wrote: \u201cEach of the planets, ac-\ncording to them has its own particular course, and its velocities and periods of time are sub-\nject to change and variation.\u201d'\u201d They also knew that Earth was a sphere and thus counted it\namong the planets. This is evidenced by the words of Diodorus who wrote that the Chaldeans\nhad it stated \u201cthat the moon\u2019s light is reflected and her eclipses are due to the shadow of the\nearth.\u201d\n\nAmong the Babylonians, texts that deal strictly with astronomical, as opposed to astro-\nlogical, observations do not seem to have made their appearance until about the middle of the\nseventh century B.C. during the reign of Nabonassar. It is from about this time, down to the\nturn of the millennium, that we have in our possession a collection of cuneiform tablets to\nwhich Abraham Sachs has applied the term \u201castronomical diaries.\u201d\n\nThese diaries record such phenomena as the length of the lunar months, based on the\nphases of the Moon; lunar and solar eclipses; the dates of first visibility for Mars, Jupiter, and\nSaturn; the first and last visibilities of the inner planets, Venus and Mercury; the dates of the\noccurrences of the equinoxes and solstices; the dates of the significant appearances of the star\nSirius; and the \u201cconjunction\u201d of the Moon and each of the visible planets with various stars.\nMeteorological phenomena during the rainy seasons are also recorded, with diverse cloud\nand storm conditions. To all of this, one finds appended the changes in the level (rise or fall)\nof the river at Babylon, often followed \u201cby a report of secular events or rumors of such\nevents.\u201d Finally, the amount of produce (barley, dates, etc.) that could be purchased for one\nshekel of silver during any one month is also listed. The technical data\u2014 measurements, cal-\nculations\u2014 given in cubits and degrees, are evidence of a sophisticated attempt at reconciling\nonce mysterious motions with numerical allocation, while the glosses concerning obstruction\nof visibility by bad weather are indicative of diligent observation.\u201d\n\nThere is nothing spurious about these astronomical diaries\u2014nothing magical, mythologi-\ncal, or even faintly oracular. They are a mere record of the night by night occurrences con-\ncerning the heavenly bodies\u2014hence the term \u201cdiaries\u2019\u2014month by month, throughout the\nyear. Were it not for the historical events that they also report, they would probably have in-\nspired less interest among scholars. Astronomically, they are nothing but a catalogue of the\nsame boring celestial events that we see enacted in the sky above us to this day. But they are\naccurate \u2014so that a modern student of astronomy would not have been embarrassed had he\nor she been the author of the diaries.

These continued to record the recurrence of astronomical phe-\nnomena, year by year, \u201cwith an accuracy comparable with that of contemporary observa-\ntions.\u201d\"\u201d' Judging by the contents of the astronomical diaries, this accuracy can be stretched\nto 747 B.C.\nThere is no great wonder in all of this, but it does prove one point, banal as it may seem,\nand that is this: Beginning from aft least the middle of the seventh century B.C., Babylonian\nastronomers knew very well what these pin-points of light called planets looked like and\ncould easily distinguish one from the other; they knew where every planet belonged in the\nsky and what track each one of them invariably followed\u2014an easy matter for anyone with a\nkeen eye-sight plus the patience and the motivation to learn. Yes, I know, it is hardly even\nworth mentioning.\nWhy, then, contrary to what we see above us in the night sky at present, did these same\nBabylonian astronomers insist that the planet we call Saturn had been the most prominent\nbody in the sky?\nThat is a question the answer to which, beginning in the very next chapter of this work,\nwill carry us into some very strange and deep waters.",

But was Diodorus the only writer of\nantiquity who ever reported this strange belief concerning the planet Saturn? And, in fact,\nwere the Babylonians the only ones who were supposed to have asserted this oddity?\nTo give but one other example\u2014and later we shall give others\u2014we note here one of the\nSanskrit names of the planet Saturn, that is Grahanayakah.* The name is composed of the",

Do we not hear from them directly? With so\nmany cuneiform tablets having been lost through the vagaries of nature and the hand of man,\nand with so many undeciphered others falling apart in museum basements, it would not have\nbeen remarkable had this datum not survived in the original. But it has, and in more than one\ntext.\n\nR. C. Thompson might have been the first to discover, even if not entirely understand,\nthis Babylonian verity. Thus, another Babylonian name for the planet Saturn was (Mul) Lu-\nBat Sag-US,\u2019 and we find it stated in an astrological report from that nation that \u201c(Mul) Lu-\nBat Sag-US Mul (il) Sama Su-u,\u201d which Thompson translated as \u201c[the planet] Saturn is the\nstar of the sun.\u201d\u201d\u00b0\n\nActually, Diodorus should have known that this belief was already common among the\nscholars of his own nation. Eratosthenes of Alexandria, who thrived somewhere between 276\nand 194 B.C., and whose astronomical, mathematical, and geographical knowledge enabled\nhim, as we have already seen, to measure Earth\u2019s circumference, identified the planet Saturn\nas the star of the Sun, as so did several other Greek writers.''

In his enumeration of the planets, the Latin writer Gaius\nTulius Hyginus who, as the superintendent of the Palatine Library, must have had access to\nmuch older material, referred to the planet in question as the star of Sol.\" As just about any\ndictionary will verify, Sol was not only the Roman Sun personified, it was, as it still is, the\nvery Latin word for \u201cSun.\u201d From it are derived such English words as \u201csolar,\u201d \u201csolarium,\u201d\nand \u201csolstice.\u201d The scholiast on Germanicus also lists Saturn as Stella Solis'\u00b0\u2014Star of the\nSun\u2014a name which apparently was a common designation for the planet in Roman times.'\u00b0\n\nBut whence the belief? Better still, what does the designation \u201cstar of the Sun\u201d really\nmean? To what does it allude?\n\nA telling clue comes from Sanskrit. In this language, Surya is the common name for the\nSun. Suryaputrah, which means \u201cson of the Sun,\u201d is however one of the names for the planet\nSaturn.\u201d Another Sanskrit name for the Sun is Ravi and, again, we find the planet Saturn\ndesignated as Raviputra which also means \u201cson of the Sun.\u201d\u201d As the son of the Sun, Saturn\ncould be termed the star of the Sun. But this only raises another question. Why would Saturn,\namong the planets, have been thought of as the son of the Sun?\n\nLet us go one step farther. Yet another Sanskrit name for the planet Saturn is Saurah. But\nsaurah also means \u201csolar day\u201d and/or \u201csolar month.\u201d This seems to indicate that the con-\nnection between Saturn and the Sun was more intimate than we have so far deduced. In fact,\nthis last datum is enough to make one believe that, at least to the Hindus, Saturn and the Sun\nwere close to being synonymous.\n\n(MUL) LU-BAT SAG-US\n\nA common entry in a collection of astrological reports from Nineveh and Babylon which,\nin variant forms, is many times repeated, uses the formula \u201cWhen Shamash [the same as\nSama] stands in the halo of Sin\u201d such and such a thing will come to pass.\u201d Now open up\njust about any work on Assyro-Babylonian mythology and you will find it stated that\nShamash and Sin were the deified Sun and Moon. According to this belief, the omen men-\ntioned above would then translate as \u201cwhen the Sun stands in the halo of the Moon\u201d such and\nsuch a thing will come to pass.\n\nNow while Sun and Moon can be seen together, the Sun can never appear in the halo of\nthe Moon. For one thing, the Sun does not appear small enough to fit between the Moon and\nits surrounding halo\u2014when it has one; for another, the Moon can only appear within a halo\nduring the night when the Sun, needless to say, is absent. What, then, could the Babylonian\nastrologers have been alluding to?",

        "content": "There is no point in claiming that this was astrological nonsense. Babylonian astrologers,\nlike those of ancient China, were required to acquaint their rulers with the mandates of\nheaven, to warn them of impending disasters or to soothe their fears with reports of divine\nsatisfaction. The foretold events might not always have come to pass. Fallacious predictions,\nhowever, were one thing; impossible ones were quite another. There would have been no\npoint in predicting an event based on an astronomical occurrence that could never have come\nto pass. A prognostication based on the appearance of the Sun within the halo of the Moon\nwould not only have been useless, it would have been considered utterly insane. No Babylon-\nian astrologer would have risked ridicule, not to mention royal displeasure, by sending such a\nprediction to his king. Why, then, did they even bother writing down such a formula?\n\nAs Morris Jastrow, even without knowing the full implication of these formulae, con-\ncluded: \u201cSince this phenomenon can only occur at night, Sama cannot of course be the\nsun.\u201d\n\nThis brings us back to the Babylonian statement mentioned earlier which reads \u201c(Mul)\nLu-Bat Sag-U8 (il) SamaS Su-u,\u201d and which, as we have seen, Thompson translated as\n\u201cSaturn is the star of the sun.\u201d Jastrow, however, has noted that while this reading is possible,\na more accurate translation would be \u201cSaturn is the sun-star.\u201d\u201d We note here the difference\nbetween calling Saturn the star of the Sun\u2014the star belonging to the Sun\u2014and naming it as\nthe Sun-star since the latter seems to connote the Sun itself. In fact, another translation given\nby Jastrow is \u201c[the] planet Saturn (as a) star is Shamash.\u201d Stated more clearly, what this\ndatum is really telling us is that \u201cthe planet Saturn is Shamash\u201d\u2122 or \u201cShamash is the planet\nSaturn.\u201d\n\nWhat is also of interest is that this statement appears as a gloss in one of those omens\nwhich uses the formula \u201cwhen Shamash stands in the halo of Sin.\u201d* This, then, was the as-\ntrologers\u2019 way of informing whoever read this particular report that by Shamash the planet\nSaturn, and not the Sun, was meant. The formula in question should therefore read \u201cwhen\nSaturn stands in the halo of Sin\u201d such and such a thing will come to pass.\n\nThis is further clarified by another gloss which appears in a number of similar cases\nwhich unambiguously declares that (Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-U8 ina tarbas Sin izzaz\u201d \u2014i.e. \u201cSaturn\nstands in the halo of Sin.\u201d* This not only makes better observational sense, it\ncompliments\u2014nay, validates\u2014the formula which uses Shamash as a name for Saturn. If\nconditions permit, the pin-point of light in the night sky that is Saturn can be discerned\nwithin the halo of the Moon. (Actually, this argument, which I myself have had reason to\nrepeat in the past,\u201d is not even called for because, as I will indicate in a future work, Sin did\nnot always stand for the Moon.\u201d)\n\nThompson, of course, was aware before Jastrow that the Babylonians called Saturn by the\nname of Shamash.\u201d Since this verity came to light at least as early as 1900, it is a sin of\nomission\u2014worse still, a scholarly deception\u2014not to have it so stated in current works deal-\ning with Assyro-Babylonian mythology.

In this case the\ngloss was made to indicate \u201cSame u-mi\u201d\u2014i.e. \u201cSama of the day.\u201d\u00ae\nIn fact, variants of the name Shamash still mean \u201csun\u201d in many modern Semitic lan-\nguages.\u201d Thus, in Hebrew, the common word for \u201csun\u201d is shemesh. Among the Aramaeans\nthe word was also rendered SemeS (shemesh) or SimSa (shimsha).* In pre-Islamic times, the\nArabic word was SamSu (Shamshu).* Even in Maltese, the only European language with a\ndistinctive Semitic root-base, the Sun is called xemx,\u201d where the \u201cx\u201d is phonetically equiva-\nlent to \u201csh\u201d \u2014thus shemsh.\nAll of this raises some very interesting questions. Why, for instance, was the planet Sat-\nurn called by the same name as the Sun? It is not as if the Babylonians had no other names\nfor Saturn\u2014we have already encountered two: En-Me Sar-ra and (Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-US. But\nalso, ancient names, unlike some modern ones, carried their own meanings. No one in those\ndays would have thought of naming a person or an object by using lexical abstraction.\nShemesh, and therefore Shamash, means \u201cto be brilliant,\u201d* and while this may be an apt\nname for the Sun, one would hardly think of alluding to the pin-point of light that is Saturn\nby the same appellation. And yet this is precisely what the Babylonians did. As Jastrow was\nforced to conclude, \u201cthe fact that Saturn was also called the \u2018sun\u2019 is vouched for, both by ex-\nplanatory notes attached to astrological connotations, and by notices in classical writings to\nthat effect.\u201d\u00ae Thus, while we understand that Shamash was the name of the planet Saturn as\nwell as the Sun, is it also to be understood that Saturn was once believed to have been as\nbrilliant as the Sun?\nTHE LIGHT OF THE GODS\nThe close relationship, or quasi-synonymy, between the planet Saturn and the Sun was\nnot, in Mesopotamia, restricted to the Babylonian Shamash. The Sumerian planetary god\nNinurta also shared this dual characteristic. Thus Stephen Langdon could speak of \u201cthe sun-\ngod Ninurta\u201d in one breath while claiming in the next that, in Sumero-Babylonian religion,\nNinurta was \u201cthe war god and planet Saturn.\u201d\u201d It was even said of Ninurta that his face was\nShamash.\u201d\nTogether with many other deities, Ninurta has often been presented by mythologists as a\nstorm god. This view owes its origin to the texts themselves in which Ninurta is lauded as u\nsur me-a* or, in Sumerian, as Lugal-e ud me-l\u00e9m-bi nir-gal.\u00ae In the past, these epithets had\nbeen translated as \u201cthe most furious storm (or stormwind)\u201d and \u201cKing, Storm whose bril-",

When a reason is given, it usually runs some-\nthing like the following: Nimrod, sometimes called Nebrod, the traditional founder of Baby-\nlon, was \u201cthe first to become king on earth...and took as title the name of the planet Kronos\n[which was Saturn].\u201d* Nimrod, however, did not have to take the name of the planet Saturn\nbecause his name was already that of Saturn. Thus, for instance, Nimrod has also, and often,\nbeen claimed to be an alias of Ninurta.\u201d The actual truth, however, is that the two names are\nreally one and the same. The cuneiform characters which spell nin, ur, and ta can also be\nread nim, ru, and ud respectively\u201d \u2014which can be said to be the same syllables in reverse\nand which, of course, spell \u201cnimru-ud,\u201d a name that has been popularized as \u201cNimrod.\u201d*\n\nOf course, it is not only in legendary tales, such as those dealing with Nimrod, that Saturn\nwas lauded as king\u2014often the very first king the world had ever known. As we have already\nseen above, in the original, that is older, sources, Ninurta/Saturn is himself proclaimed\nlugal\u2014that is \u201cking.\u201d And this, again, is in keeping with the mytho-historical record since all\nof the Saturnian deities were revered as kings, the first of their line.\n\nFormerly, when the decipherment of cuneiform was still in its infancy and the translitera-\ntion of the Mesopotamian deities had not yet been formalized, the name Ninurta was vari-\nously read as Ninib, Ninip, or simply Nin, a title which has been translated as meaning\n\u201cLord,\u201d although it also stands for \u201cLady.\u201d\u201d (And is it because of this that Fred Bratton\nlisted Ninurta as a fertility goddess,\u201d or was this merely a typographical error?) Thus,\nscholars of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were wont to refer to this astral\ndeity by one, or more, of the above names. Writing in 1885, George Rawlinson opted for Nin",

However, the same cuneiform sign also stood for \u201cking.\u201d* But, more\nthan that, the very same ideogram was also used to \u201cspell\u201d the name of the great Sumerian\ngod An (or Anu)\u201d who\u2014as the father of all the gods, the \u201cHead of the older generation of\ngods,\u201d standing at the beginning of every theological list from all periods*\u2014can also be\nunderstood as a personification of the Saturnian deity.\n\nMore in keeping with our subject, we also find Ninib lauded as \u201cthe light of heaven and\nearth\u201d and, quite explicitly, as \u201che who, like the sun, the light of the gods, irradiates the na-\ntions.\u201d\n\nThere is, again, no point in claiming that these were metaphorical epithets meant to be\napplied to the god and not the planet he represented because, to the ancients who venerated\nhim, the god and the planet was one and the same. And this, incidentally, is not merely my\ncontention. Conventional mythologists had recognized this fact for themselves even though\nthey found it very difficult to accept. Thus Peter Jensen was forced to see in Saturn an an-\ncient symbol of the \u201ceastern sun\u201d or \u201cthe sun on the horizon,\u201d\u00ae without however offering a\nsingle piece of evidence for this interpretation. George Rawlinson himself found these epi-\nthets \u201cvery difficult to reconcile with the notion that, as a celestial luminary, [Ninip] was Sat-\nurn.\u201d*' Somewhat like Jensen, he, also, sought to explain the situation by appealing to astral\nbodies other than the one indicated by the texts themselves. As he wrote: \u201cThese phrases ap-\npear to point to the Moon, or to some very brilliant star, and are scarcely reconcilable with\nthe notion that [Ninip] was the dark and distant Saturn.\u201d\u00ae\n\nElsewhere, and earlier, Rawlinson had indicated the same bewilderment when he asked:\n\u201cHow is it possible that the dark and distant planet Saturn can answer to the luminary who\n[or which] \u2018irradiates the nations like the sun, the light of the gods\u2019?\u201d\u00ae\n\nNINGIRSU\n\nOther than earlier readings of the name Ninurta as Nin, Ninib, Ninip, etc., the deity in\nquestion possessed some bona fide aliases, one of which was Ningirsu*\u2014the Lord of Girsu\n(in Lagash).\u00a9 This is ascertained by the Gula Hymn of Bullutsa-rabi in which the consort of\nthe goddess Gula (also known as Bau and/or Nin-Karrak)\u00ae is called by various names among",

Thus we find it recorded in\nGudea\u2019s Cylinder B:\n\u201cNingirsu...rose in overwhelming splendor. In the land it became day; the Eninnu\n[another epithet of the god] rivaled in brilliance the child of Enzu.\u201d\u00ae\nThis Enzu, also read Zu-en, was the more familiar Sin. His \u201cchild\u201d was Shamash, often\nreferred to as Shamash mar Sin \u2014i. e. Shamash son of Sin.\u00ae\nThis led William Albright to state that \u201cNingirsu is here the sun...who ascends each\nmorning from the underworld.\u201d\u201d That Albright was not well acquainted with the character-\nistics of this deity is further illustrated when he also opined that \u201cNingirsu, like Ninurta,\nseems to have been primarily a god of fertility with intimate solar associations.\u201d\u201d Albright\ndid recognize that Ningirsu has \u201csolar associations,\u201d but that Ningirsu was Saturn and not the\nSun had already been demonstrated by Jastrow.\u201d\nThis identification is based on a series of deductions which not only proves the ancient\nidentity of Ningirsu but also that of Ninurta. These deductions lead us back to those omens\nincorporating the formula \u201cwhen Shamash stands in the halo of Sin\u201d that we have already\nhad occasion to note. Apart from the gloss already there discussed, which explains that\nShamash is the name of the planet Saturn (Lu-Bat Sag-US), we also come across a clarifica-\ntion which names Ninib/Ninurta as \u201cstanding therein.\u201d\u201d This indicates, beyond any reason-\nable doubt, that Ninib/Ninurta was the same as Lu-Bat Sag-US/Shamash/Saturn.\u201d As Donald\nMackenzie noted: \u201cThe sun god was identical with Ninip and Nin-Girsu...and resembling\nBabbar, \u2018the shining one,\u2019 the solar deity of Akkadian Sippar, whose Semitic name was\nShamash.\u201d\u201d Also, in a slab relief of the god retrieved from the temple of Ninurta in ancient\nKalakh (or Kalhu), present-day Nimrud (still named after the very god), Ninurta is depicted\nwith the scythe as one of his weapons. As is widely known, the scythe was the favored\nweapon of Kronos/Saturnus. Thus, as Jastrow admitted, Franz Kugler was correct in identify-\ning \u201cthe planet (Lu-Bat) whose name is Ninib [i.e. Ninurta]\u201d as referring to Saturn.\u201d And,\nlet\u2019s face it, in a bilingual list of the planets, now in the British Museum, Ninurta is definitely\nlisted as the name of the planet Saturn.\u201d\nNow it should be understood that the term \u201cLu-Bat\u201d was also used to designate Mars and\nMercury besides Saturn. A. F. O\u2019D Alexander, however, misunderstood the usage of this\nterm when he stated that a \u201cfurther ambiguity was caused by using Jubad [the same as Lu-\nterm when he stated that a \u201cfurther ambiguity was caused by using lubad [the same as Lu-\nBat] (\u2018planet\u2019) sometimes for Saturn, sometimes for Mercury.\u201d\u2122 What Alexander should",

As\nJastrow however pointed out, the listing of Ningirsu as an alias of Ninurta leaves no doubt as\nto which Lu-Bat\u2014i.e. which planet\u2014is intended.

        "content": "(For those in the know: The association of Ninurta with Nergal, as also with the Greek\nHerakles, will be discussed in a future volume.)\n\nTHE TRUE SUN\n\nLike that of other ancient nations, Hindu astronomy is inseparable from mythology. This\nparticular mythology, however, continues to thrive as the basis of Hindu religion. In a way, it\ncan therefore be said that, among the Hindus, planetary worship is practiced to this day\u2014and\nnot only in an indirect way. Here I would like to remind the reader of that passage from the\nLinga Purana we had earlier looked at which admonishes that \u201cthe worship of the planets\nshould be pursued by good men.\u201d Moreover, the reason behind this admonition is the ward-\ning-off of evil at times of planetary \u201charassment.\u201d That, in these modern times, not many\npracticing Hindus are even aware of these words, and that few, if any, among them actually\npractice planetary worship, is besides the point. What is at issue here is that the admonition in\nquestion is contained in one of the missals, if you wish, by which one of the world\u2019s great\nliving religions is meant to abide.\n\nLike the gods of other nations, Vedic deities are known by more than one name or epithet\nas so, also, are the planets. Thus, one of the names for the Sun in Sanskrit is Arka.\u00ae But then\nwe find that three related designations for the planet Saturn in the same language are Arki,\u201d\nArka-putra,\u201d and Arkatanayah.\u00ae Both Arka-putra and Arkatanayah translate as \u201cson of the\nSun.\u201d \u00a9 Arkaja, which means \u201csun-born\u201d can also be applied to the planet Saturn,\u201d as so,\nalso, can Arkanandana.\u201d So, once again, we find the planet Saturn bearing a name which is\nshared by the Sun.\n\nHindu mythology, of course, is largely based on Vedic belief. And yet, as one critic\npointed out quite a few years ago, it has never been proved to the general satisfaction of In-\ndologists that any planets are mentioned in the Vedas.\u201d As I had earlier written in reference\nto this criticism, however, this lack can be compensated for \u201cif it can be shown that certain\ndeities mentioned in the [Vedic] hymns possess planetary traits and/or characteristics com-\nparable to the [known] planetary deities of other nations.\u201d\u00ae Today I can go even further be-\ncause, if it can be shown that the names and/or epithets applied to the Vedic deities are iden-\ntical to those applied to the planets by the same race and in the same language, the equiva-\nlence of deities and planets is proven on home ground without any recourse or appeal to\ncomparative studies. Such, for instance, is the case with Brahma, the supreme creator of In-\ndian mythology.\n\nStrictly speaking, Brahma was not a Vedic deity. He more properly belongs to that corpus\nof Hindu lore known as Brahmanic mythology. He was proclaimed the first of the Devas,\nusually said to mean \u201cgods,\u201d but which properly translates as \u201cshining ones. Here it should\nbe noted that the Sanskrit adjective brahmanya means \u201crelating [or belonging] to Brahma. \u201d*",

Despite their star maps, charts, and cal-\nendars, when it comes to the planets and their motions, nothing has survived from pre-Alex-\nandrian Egypt that would allow us to claim an astronomical achievement on their part.\nOn the other hand, if conventional mythologists can treat of deities like Horus and Ra as\nsolar representations, with the likes of Isis and Hathor as lunar or Venerian ones, then so are\nwe allowed to treat them as celestial bodies. In fact, as already noted, ask any mythologist to\nname the solar god par excellence and the name of Ra (or Re) is bound to come up. Not only\nis Ra presented as the Egyptian sun god, he is believed to have been the Sun itself.

        "content": "Even so, on the basis of this one datum, I would not be bold enough to build an edifice.\nAnd, as a qualification I should perhaps add that this does not mean that Ra never stood for\nthe Sun. It is obvious from texts of a historical, or narrative, but not mythological, nature\nthat the Sun was also referred to as Ra. But is this not the same situation we have found\namong other nations where the planet Saturn and the Sun are made to share the same name?\n\nMeanwhile, the Ptolemaic identification of Ra as Saturn is given additional credence by\nthe Greek poet known as Nonnus. A native of Panapolis in Ptolemaic Egypt, Nonnus like-\nwise referred to the Arabic Sun as Kronos\u201d which, again, was the same as calling the Sun\nby the name of Saturn.\n\nNow it is true that the Greeks, and after them the Romans, had a penchant for calling\nalien deities and celestial bodies by what they understood to be their Greek, or Roman, coun-\nterparts. It is also known that, in certain cases, their matching was somewhat arbitrary. But\nneither the planet Saturn nor the Sun could have contributed to such arbitrariness since both\nluminaries were beyond confusion. So why would Nonnus have chosen to call the Arabic\nSun by the name of the planet Saturn? Is not one inclined to assume that a similar ambiguity\nbetween the Sun and the planet Saturn must have existed in Arabic nomenclature? And does\nthis not indicate that the Graeco-Egyptian who had it recorded that Ra stood for Kro-\nnos/Saturn was, in fact, echoing the popular belief of the time?\n\nThe Greeks, of course, had their own lore to draw upon. Not only did they, as we have\nseen, refer to the planet Saturn as the star of Helios, that is the star of the Sun, they actually\nidentified it outright as Helios. Thus, for instance, Plato (or Philip of Opus'\u00ae) wrote that pre-\neminent among the planets for its slowness was the one whom \u201csome call ...Kronos,\u201d'\"\u201d\nwhich is Saturn. But, in the earliest copies of the text, the name used was not Kronos but,\nrather, Helios.\"\u00b0 It was only later copyists, who could not understand why the planet Saturn\nwas here being alluded to by the name of the Sun, who \u201ccorrected\u201d the text to read \u201cKronos,\u201d\nthe \u201caccepted\u201d Greek name of the planet Saturn. As Franz Boll, whose illuminating study of\nthis subject has long been ignored, demonstrated, the practice of \u201ccorrecting\u201d such\ntexts\u2014changing the name \u201cHelios\u201d to read \u201cKronos\u201d\u2014was quite common among later\ncopyists.\u201d\"\n\nTo Porphyry, originally named Malchus, the Greek historian and Neoplatonist from Tyre,\nin Syria, Kronos/Saturn was also called Helios\u2019? as it was to Rhetorios and Claudius\nPtolemy himself.\u2019\u00ae All of which further indicates that the Ptolemaic identification of Ra as\nKronos/Saturn was in keeping with the belief of the time.\n\nAs it happens, the name \u201cHelios\u201d closely resembles the Greek transliteration of the Ca-\nnaanite/Phoenician \u201cEl,\u201d that is \u201cElos,\u201d a deity who, as Philo Byblius proclaimed, was the\nsame as Kronos/Saturn.'* Thus a confusion between the names Elos and Helios has been\nsuggested to be at the root of this belief.\"\u00b0 This point is somewhat tacky because, in my\nopinion, the Greek Helios, together with similar divinities incorporating the same philol-\nogical root, does ultimately derive from El.

Besides, as Boll pointed out, and as we have seen, the association of Saturn\nwith the Sun was much too widespread to be attributed to a Greek confusion based on\nPhilo.\"\u00b0 Boll\u2019s own conclusion was that the naming of the planet Saturn as Helios was not\ndue to any confusion of names, and hardly a confusion of the luminaries involved, but owed\nits cause to the simple fact that, originally, Helios and Kronos were one and the same god\nand, therefore, one and the same planet\u2014that is Saturn.\u201d\nAmbrosius Theodosius Macrobius, the Roman philosopher and grammarian who lived\nbetween 395 and 423 A.D., has been much maligned for claiming, in the first book of his\nSaturnalia, that all forms of worship derived from that of the Sun. Among the misconcep-\ntions that are laid at his door is his identification of Kronos as the Sun.\" But, having learned\nwhat we now have, can we honestly say that Macrobius was that much in error? Was he not,\nin his own way, reporting what his ancestors, and those of the Greeks before them, had be-\nlieved\u2014that Saturn bore the name of the Sun?\" Should we fault him for believing that this\nsun was the same Sun that shone daily above his head? Have we not now seen that most\nmodern mythologists have been trapped into committing the same error?\nThis belief was so inbred in the early sciences it even turns up in alchemy, the foster-\nmother of chemistry. When astrology embraced, and thus debased, what had commenced as a\nmonopolized industry in the transformation of base metals into gold-simulating alloys by the\npriestly caste of Alexandria, ancient astronomical lore entrenched itself in mystical treatises\nthat were to obsess alchemists well past medieval times. Among these astro-chemical echoes\nwe encounter the statement that the planet Saturn constitutes \u201cthe best sun,\u201d which reminds\nus of Saturn as the \u201ctrue sun\u201d believed in by Hindu sages. As David Talbott well realized:\n\u201c...it is unlikely that [the alchemists] themselves knew what to do with the idea. But\nthat the tradition was passed down from remote antiquity is both indisputable and\ncrucial.\u201d\nThis belief was so deeply entrenched that the Swiss psychologist, Carl Jung, could refer\nto Saturn as \u201cthe second sun\u201d as if the oddity was well known. '\u201d\nFIRST INTERLUDE\nThe handing down of traditions from remote antiquity of which Talbott speaks above\ndoes not, however, explain the tenacity with which ancient man has held to the idea that Sat-\nurn was a sun. Neither does it explain how the belief itself originated. So that, despite the fact\nthat ideas do travel over distance, across geographical boundaries, and through time, from\ncenturies to millennia, it is not easy to understand why a belief in something that was obvi-\nously not so could have survived the advertency of the ages.\nIt is therefore not enough to maintain that this belief owes its spread to diffusion, cultural\ncontact, or wholesale borrowing, because, for one thing, we are not here concerned with an\nidea that would readily have lent itself to popular appeal.

In this respect, it was no different then than it is now.\nGranted that religion would have augmented the belief until it fossilized itself into a\ncredo of faith, the question of why such an obvious falsity would have been incorporated in\nritual litanies in the first place remains unanswered. More amazing is the fact that the belief\nsurvived the scrutiny of those who were in the best position to know otherwise\u2014the as-\ntronomers and astrologers. How could these professional men have attempted to utilize the\ndatum in a more practical way when the belief on which it was based belied reality.\nWe can, perhaps, understand how an error in astronomical observation, or a miscalculated\nset of figures, could have been misconstrued into a truth. Habitual acceptance of such a mis-\nconstrued fact might even, in time, have cemented the misconception into dogmatic belief. It\nhappens. But the incongruity of a belief in something which was demonstrably false would\nhave had a difficult time in being accepted as dogma by a culture and installed as a pillar of\nastrological wisdom supposedly based on astronomical verity. It is difficult to understand\nwhy ancient astronomers, astrologers, or priests looked up at the planet Saturn and asserted\nthat it was a sun. More difficult to believe would be that such a preposterous idea, even if it\nwas somehow believed in, say, by the Babylonians, could have been foisted on a people of a\ndifferent culture. Everyone could look up into the sky and see that Saturn was not a sun. One\nneed not have been an astronomer in order to expose such a deceit.\nWhat people might have believed is that Saturn could have once shone as a sun. This\nwould have been different because although everyone could see that Saturn did not shine as a\nsun, there was no way they could tell whether it once did. And, let us face it, man has long\nbeen prone to the possibility that things could have been different in remote antiq-\nuity\u2014which renders this very study beyond exception.\nOn the other hand, whether imbedded in fact or fiction, every belief has to have an origin.\nSo what could have been the origin of this particular one? One explanation offered by Pin-\ngree is that the Sun\u2019s hyposoma sets as Saturn\u2019s rises.\"\u00b0 A hyposoma\u2014plural, hyposo-\nmata\u2014is the astrological term for the point in the zodiacal sign in which a planet is believed\nto exert its greatest influence. But, as Ulla Koch- Westenholz noted, \u201cthe earliest evidence for\nthe hyposomata is from the seventh century BC,\u201d and the association of Saturn and the sun\nis certainly older and far more entrenched in the tradition than warranted by such arcane\nspeculations.\u201d \u00ae The classicist R. Beck had a different explanation. As he had it stated:\n\u201cIn ancient astrology it is widely attested...that Saturn was the star of the\nSun...Graeco-Roman astrology made the [same] identification because Babylonian\nastrology had made it already, and the western tradition here simply drew on its older\neastern relative.\u201d\nBut the Babylonians and, before them, the Sumerians, had absolutely no reason to invent\nthe postulate, to perpetrate this astronomical lie. It could have served no purpose\u2014religious,\npolitical, or otherwise. It would not have answered any questions posed by theology, sover-\neignty, or nature. Besides, if we are to invoke diffusion as a solution to this problem, how\nwould we explain similar beliefs from the American continent which, we have been taught,\ncould have had absolutely no contact with the world of the ancient Near East?

        "content": "this point, delve into Mesoamerican lore to uphold the thesis being developed, since I would\nlike to reserve that for a later part of this work. But it would do no harm here to note that in\nanalysing the Mayan holy book known as the Popul Vuh, which, among other things, deals\nwith the glowing face of the sun, it comes out unreservedly that certainly it was not the same\nsun which we see.'\u201d\n\nWould it then be too much to consider what appears to be the only other alternative\u2014that\nwhat the ancients believed was indeed what they, or their ancestors, had actually seen and\nexperienced?\n\nBefore we answer that question, let us consider one additional point. The ancients did not\nmerely maintain that Saturn was, or had been, a sun. They alluded to it as such as if it was, or\nonce had been, general knowledge; as if everyone knew that this was, or had been, the case.\nNo explanations, clarifications, or qualified rationalizations are ever encountered to account\nfor the phenomenon. But, whether speaking of the Saturnian god as distinct from his lumin-\nary or of the luminary that was Saturn itself, it was always accepted that deity and planet,\nwhich in reality were one, coruscated, or had once coruscated, as a true sun. Personally, this\nwas one aspect concerning the Saturnian phenomenon which further convinced me that not\nonly did the ancients mean exactly what they \u201csaid,\u201d but that they probably knew what they\nwere \u201ctalking\u201d about. But what, exactly, did this amount to?\n\nAt this point we had best lay the cards we have so far accumulated plainly on the table.\nWe have, I believe, supplied ample evidence (and more will be forthcoming in the chapters\nthat follow) to indicate that the ancients believed Saturn to have once radiated as a sun. As\nHodder Westropp and Staniland Wake had concluded long before Jastrow on studying an-\ncient symbolism, as far as the ancients were concerned, Saturn was the first irradiator of\nlight.'* But a question we posed earlier remains unanswered. This concerns the sharing of\nnames between Saturn and the Sun. But then, what is true\u2014that Saturn was given the former\nname of the Sun, or that the Sun was given the former name of Saturn?\n\nBoll seems to have had no doubts about this. As far as he was concerned, the Greek Hel-\nios and the Latin Sol were originally the names of the planet Saturn.\u201d Here I would like to\nmention the cult of Sol Invictus, the Unconquered Sun, which did not gain significant ascen-\ndancy until the third century A. D.

In\nwhich case the question could be asked: Was there also a cult of Sol Victus\u2014\u201cthe conquered\nSun\u201d? As Wescott concluded: \u201cAlthough this latter phrase [i.e. Sol Victus] does not occur in\nRoman literature, the phrase Sol Indigetes is found, referring to an older sun-god.\u201d\u201d\n\nIt can therefore be conjectured that in each case where Saturn and the Sun share the same\nname, the name originally belonged to Saturn. This suspicion moves closer to certainty when\nwe realize that, while every major ancient name of the Sun was also bestowed on Saturn, not\nevery ancient name of the planet Saturn was bestowed on the Sun.

The best that Wallis Budge could offer by way\nof an explanation was that Atum,, whom he referred to by the name\u2019s former reading of\nof an explanation was that Atum, whom he referred to by the name\u2019s former reading of\nTemu, was the Sun after it had set.  ?

Sun worship at night, however, makes for an\nincongruous institution. This fallacious interpretation should never have been derived, and it\nwould not have, had the Egyptologists thought of comparing their texts more diligently with\nthose in the hands of the Assyriologists.\nThere has never been any doubt that, as far as the Egyptians themselves were concerned,\nAtum \u201cwas held to be one of the forms of the great Sun-god Ra..   .\u201d?

While this seems to\nhave really been the case, it must not be assumed that the assimilation was an arbitrary one.\nThis assimilation resulted in the double god known as Atum-Ra (or Ra-Atum)\u2019 as indicated\nHere, perhaps, we could add that Ra was also worshipped by  the  same name in\nin the hymn contained in the Papyrus of Mut-hetep\u00ae and elsewhere.\nHere, perhaps, we could add that Ra was also worshipped by the same name in\nMesopotamia,  although his Semitic equivalent, El, was more popular.\u201d This  should not\nMesopotamia, although his Semitic equivalent, El, was more popular.\u201d This should not\nsurprise us.

George Rawlinson, writing in 1885, who\ndid not accept the identification of god with planet, had this to say concerning this ancient\nbelief:\n\u201cThe identification of the Chaldean II [i.e. El] or Ra with Saturn, which Diodorus\nmakes, and which may seem to derive some confirmation from Philo-Byblius, is cer-\ntainly incorrect, so far as the planet Saturn, which Diodorus especially mentions, is\nconcerned; but it may be regarded as having a basis of truth, inasmuch as Saturn was\nin one sense the chief of the gods...\u201d\u201d\u201d\nThis, however, seems to have been the bane of mythologists from day one, in that they\nhave always had the audacity to proclaim that, thousands of years after the fact, they are in a\nbetter position to know what the ancients believed than the very ancients themselves. Given\nall this, may we not assume that Atum, who was but a facet of Ra, had also originated as a\npersonification of the planet Saturn.? But then, if Atum was honored as a sun of night, should\nwe not expect that so, also, had been Ra? This is exactly what we find. In a hymn, Ra is\nlauded as \u201cthe one alone... lying awake while all men lie asleep.\u201d And if some find that\nsomewhat ambiguous, it is made clearer in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, where the god in\nquestion is unambiguously made to state: \u201cI am that god Re who shineth in the night.\u201d\nBesides Atum and Ra, this sun of night was also anthropomorphosed by the Egyptians as\nthe god Osiris. Mariette-Bey long ago wrote that: \u201cOriginally, Osiris is the nocturnal sun; he\nis the primordial night of chaos; he is consequently anterior to Ra, the Sun of Day.\u201d * As we\nhave already seen, however, Ra, also, was considered a sun of night so that, in this respect,",

Thus, in a vignette of\nthe Book of the Dead, as elsewhere, the disk of Ra, usually said to be that of the Sun, is\nshown resting on the pillar known as Djed (or Tet) which was the emblem of Osiris.\u201d Else-\nwhere in the same work, Atum is made to utter: \u201cI am yesterday.\u201d But a few lines later it is\nstated that: \u201cYesterday is Osiris.\u201d\u00ae But let\u2019s cut across the lawn since the very same work\nleaves little doubt as to the equation of Ra with Osiris. In the liturgy for the dead, it is\nasked\u2014and answered:\n\u201c*Who then is this? It is Osiris,\u2019 or (as others say), Ra is his name, even Ra the self-\ncreated.\u201d\u201d\ncreated.\u201d\nIn other sections of the same work, Ra is presented as the soul of Osiris, while Osiris is\npresented as the soul of Ra, thus again indicating that the two gods were merely aspects of\neach other.\u201d As Lepsius pointed out, in the Book of the Dead, Osiris is even referred to as\nOsiris-Ra, while Isis, who was the wife of Osiris, is even there called \u201cthe royal consort of\nRa.\u201d It was precisely this assimilation with Ra that drove earlier mythologists to equate\nOsiris with the Sun.* James Frazer, of course, had his own reason for disagreeing with this\nidentification since, as far as he was concerned, Osiris had been nothing more than a god of\nvegetation.\u201d\nActually, the identification of Osiris as a Saturnian deity, and even as a personification of\nthe planet Saturn itself, is anything but new, having been proffered by many a mythologist.\u201d\nImmanuel Velikovsky was much in agreement with this identification.\u201d Few of these writers,\nhowever, ever presented any direct evidence that ties Osiris to Saturn. William Heidel was at\nleast shrewd enough to point out that, just as Osiris was considered the judge of the dead, so,\nalso, was Kronos/Saturn.\u201d But it is not this or that particular datum that makes our case, but,\nrather, the collective weight of various clues and diligent reasoning. And to add to what we\nhave already enumerated, I offer next the following information which refers us back to En-\nMe Sar-ra, that epithet of Shamash/Saturn which, as we have already seen, means \u201cLord of\nthe Law of the Universe.\u201d The Indic Brahma, whom we have already seen identified as the\nsame planet, was also honored as the \u201cLord of the Universe.\u201d\u201d It could not then be through\ncoincidence that another name for Osiris happens to be Neb-er-tcher, which also means \u201cgod\nof the universe.\u201d\u00ae",

Or why were there so many\nnames\u2014and we shall be meeting many others\u2014within the same nation for one and the same\nplanet? Once again, I will let Mullen answer this one\u2014at least in part. As he wrote:\n\u201cOne cause for the complexity of the account is that when the Nile valley was united\nin one kingdom, it consisted of many tribes, each with its own names for the\nplanetary gods and its own stories about them. After unification the cults of these\ngods were preserved and conflated even though in many cases one and the same\nplanet was being worshipped under different names in different places.\u201d\u201d\nAs time went by, the ancestral memory of these former times dimmed. In Egypt, the sac-\nred litanies continued to be chanted even when a full understanding of their content was part-\nially lost. Eventually, even the identities of the gods were forgotten; and were it not for the\npresent-day rediscoveries of ancient texts, we would be in no better position. In Egypt, a time\ncame when not only were planetary deities worshipped under different names in different\nplaces, but also in the very same nomes under the roof of the very same temples.\nWhen one remembers that this evolutionary process took place, not only in Egypt, but\nthroughout the entire world, one begins to appreciate the complexity of the mytho-historical\nrecord and the reason behind the legion of names which now burden the gods of humankind.\nAll of which reminds us of Fred Bratton\u2019s words when he had it stated that: \u201cIt has been es-\ntimated that a list of Sumerian deities [alone] would contain more than five thousand\nnames.\u201d Add to that the thousands of deities from other ancient civilizations and the mind\nboggles. Let us face it, we are here talking about an astronomical number of divinities. Could\nwe really hope to attach them all to just five planets, those which the ancients could see with\nthe naked eye? And yet, as we saw on an earlier page, that is precisely what Giorgio de San-\ntillana and Hertha von Dechend claimed:\n\u201cThe real actors on the stage of the universe are few, if their adventures are\nmany...The forces reside in the starry heavens, and all the stories, characters and ad-",

A prodigious assignment it may seem for those few planets to\naccount for all those stories...\u201d\u00b0\nA prodigious assignment it surely is, but not an entirely impossible one because, for one\nthing, many of these deities turn out to be nothing but aliases of each other. Take Osiris, for\nexample, seeing as we are on that subject\u2014the god was known under sixty different names in\nthe Theban recension, up to c. 1600 B.C., % which had accumulated to one hundred and fifty-\neight by the time of the Saite recension in c. 300 B.C.* In the Babylonian Enuma Elish,\nsometimes referred to as the Babylonian Creation Epic, the god Marduk is given fifty\nnames.* And if you think that these two examples constitute extremes, think again. The In-\ndic god Shiva is claimed to bear one thousand and eight different names.\u201d In fact, it will be\nfound that most of the deities of antiquity are merely aliases of each other. Nor will I be bold\nenough to proclaim that all these mythological characters are to be identified as planets since\nsome actually personify planetary powers, while others are associated with various celestial\nphenomena.\nBut, before we lose the thread of our present topic, another question should now be\nasked: Was it only in Egypt that Saturn was lauded as a sun of night?\nTHE BABYLONIAN EXEMPLAR\nActually, there is undeniable evidence that the concept of a night sun existed in ancient\nBabylonian thought as well. As Morris Jastrow indicated, Saturn and the Sun were viewed as\nthe \u201ctwo chief lights of the heaven, one to serve during the day and the other at night.\u201d\u2122\nThis is indicated by the fact, mentioned in the previous chapter, that when the Sun was in-\ntended, a gloss to that effect\u2014SamSe u-mi (ie. Shamash of the day)\u2014was inserted in those\nastrological texts dealing with Shamash/Saturn.\u201d A Shamash-of-the-day presupposes a\nShamash-of-the-night. As Jastrow expressed this idea:\n\u201cStrange as it may seem to us, the planet Saturn appears to have been regarded as \u2018the\nsun of night\u2019 corresponding to Samai as \u2018the sun of the daytime\u2019 and the cause of\nsuch light as the night furnishes.\u201d\nIt was only when trying to explain this phenomenon that Jastrow stumbled:\n\u201cTt was argued, that since there was a sun furnishing the light of day, so there must be\nsome corresponding power which causes the illuminations of the heaven at night.",

Besides, what has the slowness of a planet\nto do with its brightness?\nJastrow went on to state that the light of the Moon, as well as that of the other planets and\nthe stars, was, by the Babylonians, ascribed to Saturn.\u201d But would the Babylonians, who\ncould calculate the complex motions of the heavenly bodies with mathematical accuracy, as\nwe have seen in a previous chapter, have been so naive as to invent a concept in which even\nthe most ignorant of their peasantry could hardly have believed? Should we not rather believe\nthe words of Diodorus when he stated that the reason the Chaldeans called Saturn by the\nname of the Sun was because it was the most prominent of the five planets or the stars?\nA colleague of Jastrow, Professor J. A. Montgomery, has even raised \u201cthe interesting\nquestion whether in Genesis 1:16 the two \u2018lights\u2019 may not at one time have referred to the\nSun and Saturn?\u201d\u00ae Without realizing that the second body might have been Saturn, James\nStrickling also suggested a similar interpretation.\u201c While I do not wish to use this particular\ndatum as evidence of anything, I have to admit that it is an interesting supposition for, in the\nBiblical passage referred to, which supposedly describes the creation of Sun and Moon, nei-\nther Sun nor Moon is mentioned. The passage merely reads:\n\u201cAnd Elohim [usually translated as \u2018God\u2019] made two great lights; the greater light to\nrule the day, and the jesser light to rule the night: He made the stars also.\u201d*\nNOCTURNAL DEITIES\nWell down into the present era, the ancient belief in a former nocturnal sun continued to\nresurface in art. A floor mosaic, showing Helios riding in his four-horse chariot, was discov-\nered at the Beth Alpha Synagogue, dating to the sixth century A.D., in Israel\u2019s Jezreel Valley.\nIn it, the god is depicted riding through the night, with the Moon and a sky \u201csprinkled with\nstars\u201d behind him. The incongruity has been explained by claiming that \u201c[t]he night\nstars\u201d behind him. The  incongruity  has been explained by claiming that \u201c[t]he night\nsky...still shines around him.\u201d\u201d At no time, however, can the night sky continue to shine\naround the Sun once it has risen. In view of the fact that Helios was originally interchange-\nable with Kronos/Saturn, the mosaic in question should be allowed to speak for itself. What it\nportrays is Helios as Saturn shining at night.\nCarl Jung, among few, understood this much. He, too, had come across references to a\nsun of night. As he wrote of the Latin Sol: \u201c[T]here is...also a Sol niger [that is \u201cblack sun,\u201d\nwhich makes us think of what we earlier noted concerning \u201cblack Saturn\u201d], which,\nsignificantly enough, is contrasted with the day-time sun and clearly distinguished from it.\u201d\u201d\nThe Celtic tradition preserved in Irish and Welsh texts dates no earlier than the eighth\ncentury A.D.

Unfortunately, the ancient tales\nwere written down in their present form by early Christian monks who saw fit to turn the an-\ncient gods into men of flesh and blood. Such was Balor, he of the single flaming eye, whose\nname is ultimately derived from bhel, and thus equivalent to Beli or Bel. He who once had\nbeen a celestial divinity was turned into a terrestrial king. Despite this metamorphosis, even\nthough the idea has not been widely accepted, the characteristics of Balor have been com-\npared to those of the Sun.\u201d That Balor, however, had been a nocturnal sun is indicated by his\npared to those of the Sun.* That Balor, however, had been a nocturnal sun is indicated by his\ntitle. He was known as the King of Night. \u00ae\nTHE GOD OF SATURDAY NIGHT\nAs befitted his nocturnal station, Osiris was venerated in a festival which took place at\nnight.\n\u201cHerodotus tells us that the grave of Osiris was at Sais in Lower Egypt, and that there\nwas a lake there upon which the sufferings of the god were displayed as a mystery by\nnight. This commemoration of the divine passion was held once a year...and an im-\nage of a cow, made of gilt with a golden sun between its horns, was carried out of the\nchamber in which it stood the rest of the year...A great feature of the festival was the\nnocturnal illumination. People fastened rows of oil-lamps to the outside of their\nhouses, and the lamps burned all night long. The custom was not confined to Sais, but\nwas observed throughout the whole of Egypt.\u201d\u201d\nwas observed throughout the whole of Egypt.\u201d\u00ae\nAnother celebration connected with Osiris was the Sed festival which has been claimed to\nbe the oldest Egyptian feast of which we yet retain a trace. James Frazer has suggested that\nthe ritual, which is known to have been celebrated until the end of the Roman period, was as\nold as Egypt itself. This particular event was held every thirty years\u2014which makes it signifi-\ncant since thirty years is the period of Saturn\u2019s revolution around the Sun. As Frazer himself\nstates, this correlation of the Sed festival with the planet\u2019s revolution has been noticed, and\ncommented upon, by several scholars before him. Since then, the subject has been ap-\nproached again by de Santillana and von Dechend, although here the authors present Ptah,\nrather than Osiris, as the \u201cinventor\u201d of the festival, even though they themselves identify Ptah\nas \u201cthe Egyptian Saturn.\u201d* The Sed, of course, was a royal jubilee festival which the pharaoh\nheld after having reigned thirty years. Lucky was the pharaoh who could celebrate two such\njubilees.\nNor was this custom unique to Egypt. The Persian Shahs, who traced their lineage from\nthe towering figures of the mythical kings\u2014Kai Kubad, Kai Ka\u2019us, and Kai Khusrau\u2014also\ncelebrated their royal jubilee after having reigned thirty years\u2014a fact that did not escape the\nattention of de Santillana and von Dechend.*\nMeanwhile, a curious tale comes our way through Apuleius who tells us that, when being\ninitiated into the mysteries of Isis, wife of Osiris, a certain Lucius was given \u201cto see the sun",

In\nSanskrit, the day of Saturday is called Shanivar which, Shani being Saturn, translates as\n\u201cSaturn\u2019s Day.\u201d Actually, Saturday was the day held sacred to Saturn among more than one\nancient nation and, to this day, it continues to bear the planet\u2019s name not only in Sanskrit. To\nthe Jews, Saturday is Shabbath (the Sabbath), which word is sometimes said to derive from\nthe closely related shabath, which means \u201cto repose\u201d or \u201cto rest.\u201d In fact, however, the\nSabbath is named in honor of Saturn which, in Hebrew, is called Shabtai.\u201d The word sha-\nbath\u2014\"to repose\u201d \u2014is then traceable to the same root, derived because Elohim was said to\nhave rested from creation on that day.* In Italian, Saturday is rendered Sabato, derived from\nHebrew through the Greek Sabbaton. In Maltese, Saturday is called Sibt, derived from the\nsame Semitic root. The English name Saturday is itself a contraction of the Saxon Saterne\u2019s\nDay (or Daeg) from the Latin Saturni Dies. Even in Indo-China, and more specifically Cam-\nbodia, Saturday is named in honor of Prah Sau, which is the planet Saturn.\u201d\nSaturn.\nNow while it is true that not every ceremony that is celebrated on a Saturday has to be\nSaturnian in character and/or origin, the Indian ceremony mentioned above is itself called\nShani Pradosh.\u00ae Since pradosh means \u201cnight,\u201d the festival in question is translatable as\n\u201cSaturn\u2019s Night.\u201d A ceremony called Saturn\u2019s Night held in the evening of Saturn\u2019s Day is\nnot just any ceremony conducted on a Saturday; it is obviously one conducted in honor of\nThus it was that, among other things, Saturn became known as the Lord of the Sabbath,\u201d\na belief which finds a curious echo in Persian cosmogony. As Al-Biruni, an Arabian scholar\nof the 11th century A.D., tells us:\n\u201cOn the 6th day of Farwardin, the day Khurdadh, is the great Nauroz, for the Persians\na feast of great importance. On this day\u2014they say\u2014God finished the creation, for it\nis the last of the six days...On this day God created Saturn...\u201d*\nThe pre-Islamic feast of Nauroz\u2014or Naw Ruz, as it is sometimes transliterated\u2014continues\nto be celebrated unto this day on the eve of the Persian New Year which traditionally takes\nplace on the first day of spring. It continues to be celebrated not only in Iran (i.e. ancient Per-\nsia) but everywhere that Iranians, Afghanis, Kashmiris, Kurds, and Zoroastrians (i.e. Parsis)",

It was \u201cknown\u201d that the planet could not be emitting heat from its\nown internal source. With a core of ice, obviously, this would have been impossible.

This would be akin to the surface temperature of cool stars.8\n\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d wrote Firsoff, \u201cJupiter does emit microwave radiations corresponding to such\ntemperatures.\u201d Allowing for some thermonuclear reactions to proceed at a slow rate in their\ncentral regions, and shielded as they are by their vast opaque and cold atmospheres, Firsoff\nassumed that stellar temperatures could easily obtain inside the Jovian planets. As he con-\ncluded: \u201cThey would thus be in the nature of \u2018potted stars\u2019.\u201d9 By then, even the renowned\nGerald Kuiper was referring to Jupiter as a star and the Sun-Jupiter system as a binary. !\u00b0\n\nFAILED STARS\n\nDecember 3, 1973 is a historical date in the annals of astronomy. On that day, Pioneer 10\npassed within 81,000 miles of Jupiter. Exactly a year later, Pioneer 11 skimmed within\n27,000 miles of the planet\u2019s south polar region. The new data that these two space probes re-\nlayed to Earth sent astronomers and astrophysicists scurrying back to their slide rules and\ncalculations. Observations in the infrared had already indicated that Jupiter was much\nbrighter than would be the case had it merely been a planet reflecting light. D. A. Allen noted\nthat, at 5 mu, Jupiter appeared so bright that it must be radiating more energy than it could\nabsorb from the Sun.!! \u201cWhen the long wavelength data are also included,\u201d wrote Allen, \u201cwe\nfind that Jupiter radiates nearly three times the energy it receives.\u201d !2\n\nAs if he had been the only one or the first, D. McNally, who was then with the University\nof London Observatory, suggested the idea that Jupiter may be more like a star than a\nplanet.!3 John A. Simpson, then professor of physics at the University of Chicago, described\nJupiter as \u201cnature\u2019s best gift of what a poor man\u2019s star is like.\u201d!4\n\nWhat the data from the Pioneer probes had disclosed was that Jupiter is a fast rotating\nmass of liquid hydrogen. Its convective weather seems to be driven by what physicists began\nto call its \u201cprimordial internal heat.\u201d As time went by, more astronomers began to talk about\nJupiter\u2019s \u201cstarlike properties\u201d and its similarities to a \u201cmini-solar system.\u201d !5\n\n\u201cBut Jupiter is definitely not a star,\u201d Henry Simmons stated and added that, although the\nplanet\u2019s core may reach as much as 30,000\u00b0C, its temperature is \u201chundreds of times too low\nto ignite the thermonuclear reactions that heat the stars.\u201d!\u00a9 These giant planets, Arielle Em-\nmet echoed him, \u201ccould not heat up enough to begin deuterium burning.\u201d !7\n\nFirsoff did not quite agree. He stated that even the lowest assumed temperature of\nJupiter\u2019s interior is adequate to initiate nuclear fusion. With deuterium, which has been dis-\ncovered in the Jovian atmosphere, a reaction can start at 50,000\u00b0K. Lithium and beryllium\nburning would soon follow. \u201cThis could raise the central temperature to 1,000,000\u00b0C, re-\nquired for the proton-proton reaction, which is the main source of power in the Sun.\u201d !8",

Writing in 1976, Simmons had already spoken for the scientific community at large\nWhen he stated that, like Jupiter, Saturn appears to emit more heat than it receives from the\nSun.?!\n\u201cBeing further out [wrote Rick Gore], Saturn gets only a fourth the solar energy that\nJupiter receives. At Jupiter the solar heat striking the atmosphere is equal to the inter-\nnal heat coming up. At more distant Saturn internal heating dominates. The up-\nwelling of this heat may generate the much stronger surface winds. In any event, both\nplanets are a theorist\u2019s delight.\u201d22\nIn fact, scientists found that Saturn generates bursts of energy in the one-megahertz fre-\nquency range.\nGore described Saturn as \u201ca pale yellow giant, a turbulent ball of primordial gas that more\nresembles a star than the inner planets we know.\u201d24 Emmet had earlier expressed similar\nviews. \u201cRecent observations of the giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn,\u201d he wrote, \u201clend cre-\ndence to earlier speculation that both were actually proto-stars.\u201d Both have a system of ac-\ncompanying satellites which have been likened to miniature solar systems. 25\nSaturn\u2019s temperature was eventually given as 94.4 + 3\u00b0 K. But this, it must be pointed\nout, was not the assumed temperature of the planet\u2019s interior. Its total heat emission has been\ncalculated at about 2.2 times higher than its absorbed sunlight. It was then felt that this excess\nheat cannot be due to residue from the planet\u2019s formative period. An internal heat source,\nlong postulated, was therefore thought to be certain.26\nIn 1977 Firsoff had written that \u201cit has been obvious for many years that Saturn is heated\nfrom within.\u201d According to him, Saturn must be powered by substantially the same nuclear\nprocesses he had postulated for Jupiter.?\u201d\nRED DWARF STAR\nDark stars, cool stars, potted stars, failed stars, proto-stars\u2014all these terms have been ap-\nplied to Jupiter and Saturn and more were about to be added to the list.

Stars are suns.\nIs it not possible that Jupiter and Saturn had once burned as relatively miniature suns and\nthat, through evolutionary or catastrophic processes, they became permanently dimmed?\nThat, at least, seems to have been the final consensus as Jupiter won its place in popular\nbooks on astronomy as a body that was once much hotter. According to Roy Gallant, it\nwould even have glowed:\n\u201cJupiter, two and a half times as massive as all the other planets combined, began as\nan enormous gas ball that contracted and heated up...But, unlike the Sun, Jupiter had\nfar too little mass to send its core temperature high enough to start fusion reactions.\nInstead of reaching the millions of degrees needed, the core heated up only a few\nthousands of degrees. So Jupiter became only hot enough to glow cherry-red, like a\nred dwarf star, and for a while it bathed its inner moons in light and heat that faded as\nJupiter slowly cooled.\u201d\nMINIATURE SUN\nRichard Hoagland, in his usual recklessness, was more direct. \u201cJupiter was once a minia-\nture sun according to our current concepts of solar system formation,\u201d he was reported as\nsaying. True, he then added: \u201cIt only lasted a short time\u2014a few million years at most,\u201d3\u00b0\nwhich would also mean that it had stopped radiating millions of years ago.\nBy 1981, Saturn was known to radiate from two to three times the energy it receives from\nthe Sun.3! Its estimated internal temperature had by now risen to 20,000\u00b0 K.3? By then there\nwas no doubt that both Jupiter and Saturn were in possession of internal sources of heat.\nEven so, as Andrew Ingersol repeated what had been preached ever since the discoveries by\nthe Pioneer and Voyager probes, and in complete disregard of Firsoff\u2019s hypothesis, \u201cneither\nplanet is massive enough for gravitational self-compression to have initiated nuclear fusion.\u201d\nThe final verdict was that \u201cneither planet is a star.\u201d33\nAnd yet, as Ingersol informed his readers, \u201cJames B. Pollack and his colleagues at the\nAmes Research Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have devel-\noped models of the history of the giant planets and conclude that the interior of Jupiter and\nSaturn is still hot today.\u201d34\nBut then the extra heat was explained away: \u201cModels of the cooling of Jupiter over the\nhistory of the Solar System account for all the power that Jupiter is radiating today in excess\nof the amount it absorbs.\u201d35 When it came to Saturn, however, the models in question fell\nshort.\nFAILED MODEL\nIngersoll himself had to admit that:\n\u201cSimilar models fail, however, to account for about a third of the excess that Saturn\ntadiates.

Is it not simply because Sat-\nurn\u2019s total heat emission turned out to be significantly higher than had been predicted from\nmodels of the planet\u2019s cooling history?38 Should not this model, then, have been discarded?\nAfter all, Jupiter\u2019s excess ratio of internal heat over solar input is just about identical to that\nof Saturn.39 One is therefore led to believe that the internal heat of both planets must be due\nto near-identical causes. Or was the source of the internal heat of the two planets variously\ngiven for each of them because no single model could be found to account for both of them?\nAs it turned out, for its size, Saturn was found to be more star-like than Jupiter, emitting\nmore heat than Jupiter, overall being much more active than Jupiter.\nWriting in 1985, Leroy Ellenberger did not quite agree. As he summed the situation up:\n\u201cAll of the handwaving about Jupiter and Saturn being \u2018failed\u2019 or \u2018dark\u2019 stars\nnotwithstanding, the great preponderance of present astronomical thinking, which is\nsupported by detailed computations, indicates that planets are planets and stars are\nstars. That Jupiter and Saturn are failed stars is an obsolete idea.\u201d\nThat was Ellenberger\u2019s scholarly opinion. We, on the other hand, beg to differ.\nBROWN DWARFS\nBy 1983, Jupiter had received a new tag; it was now pigeon-holed as a brown dwarf, the\nnature of which was best explained in layman\u2019s terms by Rick Gore:\n\u201cWhen a gas cloud along a galaxy\u2019s spiral arm is compressed, it will collapse under\nits own gravity and ignite as a star if the clump has sufficient mass; if less that one-\ntenth the mass of our sun, it may become a \u2018brown dwarf.\u2019 Jupiter is such an object,\ntoo small to \u2018turn on\u2019 by nuclear fusion but still shedding heat from its collapse.\nBrown dwarfs cannot be seen at great distances but may well account for a large part\nof a galaxy\u2019s mass.\u201d42\nMuch more recently, the touted discovery of extra-solar planets have been given astro-\nphysicists enough headaches. One such headache is that, if their theorizing is all that correct,\nsome of these planets, with masses equal or greater than that of Jupiter, orbit much too close",

As Sam Flamsteed reported:\n\u201cOne possible explanation would be that these are not planets at all but brown dwarf\nstars. A brown dwarf is about as close as a star can get to being a planet without ac-\ntually being one. For one thing, it is small enough to be mistaken for a very large\nplanet, at least from a distance. And since, being small, its core is not put under\nenough pressure for nuclear reactions to take hold, it emits only a dim glow at first\nand then gradually goes dark.\u201d43\n\u201cTheorists have always assumed that brown dwarfs must be at least ten times more\nmassive than Jupiter and probably more. But perhaps they\u2019ve overestimated. Maybe a\nbrown dwarf can be six times as massive as Jupiter or even less.\u201d\nBut, as Flamsteed was shrewd enough to notice:\n\u201cTo assume that the theorists are baffled, is to underestimate them badly. A good as-\ntronomical theorist never lets the complete absence of information stand in the way of\na nice theory and, conversely, never gets thrown when an actual observation arrives\nto spoil it. Lack of data can actually be an advantage. Unhindered by facts, some\ntheorist is bound to have come up with a model that explains even the strangest\ndiscovery.\u201d45\nIn their attempt to explain the anomalous behaviour of the extra-solar planets that every-\none started discovering all over the place,\u201c it was even conjectured that there was enough\nmaterial in these systems \u201cto make planets ten times bigger than Earth.\u201d Objects of such size,\nit has been theorized, would be in possession of such gravitational fields powerful enough \u201cto\nact like a gigantic vacuum cleaner.\u201d Such objects tend to suck in \u201cwhatever nearby gas is left\nover.\u201d And the result? \u201cIn a mere 10,000 years or so you have Jupiter\u2014a rocky core ten\ntimes the size of earth surrounded by an immense atmosphere 35,000 miles thick.\u201d4\u201d\nApart from Jupiter-sized planets, this hypothesis was later applied to both Jupiter and\nSaturn themselves.\u201c All of which might make one ask: If a Jupiter-sized planet can form in\nan extra-solar system in 10,000 years or so, how can anyone be positively certain that Jupiter\nitself, or for that matter Saturn, did not take a similarly short time to form? And if that is al-\nlowed as a possibility, then how can one be positively certain that Jupiter and Saturn are bil-\nlions of years old?\nEven more was yet to come. After having been so sure they knew just about everything\nthey needed to know about Jupiter, astronomers were in for yet more surprises when Comet\nShoemaker-Levy 9 impacted the planet in July of 1994. In analyzing the aftermath of the\nimpact, they discovered that the planet has far less water than had been expected; the three\npredicted layers of the atmosphere were not detected; strong winds were found to be present\nat all levels of the atmosphere; and the amount of helium turned out to be only half of what\nhad been theorized.",

        "content": "One factor, however, remained unchanged: Excess heat was still found to be escaping\nfrom Jupiter\u2019s deep interior; the planet was still emitting at least twice the amount of energy\nit receives from the Sun.\n\nFinally \u2014one more surprise; but not from any new discovery. This one came from the as-\ntrophysicists themselves. While Saturn\u2019s excess heat has been relegated to kinetic energy re-\nleased by the circulation of dissolved helium, the lack of helium was now being blamed for\nJupiter\u2019s internal warmth.*9\n\nGo figure.\n\nSECOND INTERLUDE\n\nThe last thing I wish to be accused of is that I apply the above information to improper\nuse. So first let me state that, as the references themselves indicate, the information in ques-\ntion comes untampered from purely scientific sources. Nor am I here advocating that either\nJupiter or Saturn could sustain nuclear reactions in their cores. Not even Firsoff dared go that\nfar. But such reactions as Firsoff claimed possible were never specified as having to be, or\nhaving been, sustained. The very nature of the mytho-historical evidence I presented in the\npreceding chapters itself negates this possibility. Obviously, so does the present state of these\ntwo planets. Had such reactions been sustained, Jupiter and Saturn would still be flooding the\nnight with their radiated light. To an extent, even Ellenberger is correct. Jupiter and Saturn do\nfail as stars, but only in their present condition.\n\nAlthough it is my belief, and that of a few others, that Saturn was a true sun\u2014which\nmeans that it radiated its own light rather than having reflected that of the Sun as it does\nnow\u2014it must not be understood that it shone with a continuous blinding light. Ancient\nsources impel us to believe that, although brighter than the Moon at night, Saturn was not as\nbright as the Sun. In fact, as will be indicated in a future work, additional evidence indicates\nthat, during the day, Saturn paled in comparison to the Sun.\n\nIt should also be kept in mind that I am not here attempting to make a case for Saturn\nhaving been highly luminous in historical times, despite the fact that I have cited historical\nsources as evidence. It must be stressed that these sources allude to past events\u2014that is, even\nthough themselves ancient, their allusion is to an even older system. In actual fact, my con-\ntention is that Saturn shone as a nocturnal sun in prehistoric times\u2014that is before the age of\nwriting.\n\nThe stretch from prehistoric to historic times is measurable in only a few thousand years\nso that a critic would be absolutely correct in arguing that this does not change the fact that,\nfor both planets in question, their luminous phase is believed to have terminated billions of\nyears ago. While this is the generally accepted view, it can actually be safely stated that\nJupiter is still slightly luminous.%\u00b0 At Jupiter\u2019s size\u2014and mass\u2014has it not occurred to any-\none that something might be wrong with this implied rate of decreasing luminosity had\ndegeneration really commenced billions of years ago? And, by the same token, could not the\nsame be said for its implied rate of cooling?\n\nWhere the presently accepted scientific tenets and the hypothesis presented in this work\ndiffer is precisely in this time factor. And here, as long as one accepts current theory, the hy-\npothesis must falter.\n\nBut is currently accepted theory necessarily correct? How often have we been cocksure of\nmatters which tured out not to be so? Were astrophysicists not, until a few years ago, paint-",

Need I burden the reader with a long list of astro-\nnomical certainties which have only yesterday, so it seems, turned into myth?5!\n\nI am not raking mud as an exercise in scientific embarrassment. I do realize that this is the\nway science is meant to progress\u2014by replacing old \u201ctruths\u201d with new and, where possible,\ntheory with fact.\n\nLet not what I am about to state next be misconstrued into a fundamentalist stance. Noth-\ning could be further from the truth. But, in the past, geologists and astronomers have steadily\nincreased the age of Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe surrounding them. Is it ac-\ncepted that not a single new discovery can ever make them reverse the process?\n\nPersonally, I have no recourse but to admit that the entire hypothesis presented in this\nwork hinges on historical and mytho-historical sources. But before anyone raises the objec-\ntion that historical sources have no validity where astronomy is concerned, allow me to re-\nmind them that the history of astronomical discoveries, as already indicated in a previous\nchapter, rightly commences with such sources.\n\nThe hypothesis that Saturn was once a sun that shone at night did not originate with me.\nOthers have preceded me\u2014and they stretch all the way back to Sumerian times. Lewis\nGreenberg and Warner Sizemore were the first to bring the matter to my attention.*? As we\nhave already seen, Morris Jastrow and R. C. Thompson preceded them. But way back of us\nall there stretches a long line of writers who have left a record of this astronomical belief\nregistered on vellum, papyrus, bark, and clay.\n\nMoreover, the combined evidence that led me and my immediate predecessors to this re-\ndiscovery was not culled from mythic sources; it was not based on mythic interpretation.\nGranted that volumes could literally be filled with such complimentary evidence, the fact\nmust be stressed that the original impetus behind this assumption came from what can best be\ndescribed as ancient astronomical assertions.\n\nIn his 1910 paper on the subject, Jastrow attempted to rationalize what to him appeared as\nan impossibility. He could not see what there was in that small pin-point of light we call Sat-\nurn that could impel the ancients to allude to it as a sun. As indicated in a previous chapter,\nhis rationalization was a lame one. To repeat what I have already stated\u2014because it does\nbear repetition\u2014anyone could look up and see that Saturn was anything but a sun. Most\npeople, then as now, would not even have been capable of locating Saturn in the night sky.\nBesides, anyone could see that, Saturn or not, there was no such thing as a night sun. That is\nunless it either was so or once had been.\n\nEven so, it would be amiss for me not to point out that ancient astronomical knowledge\ncan be, as will be, complimented by mythology as long as mythic interpretation retains the\nancients\u2019 own original belief. This is something that has not always been adhered to by mod-\nem mythologists.\n\nModern mythologists, on the other hand, should not be faulted for their misconceptions\nfor they, too, looked up and the only sun they saw was the one that shines upon us now. Nor\nis this a uniquely modern misconception. The ancient Greeks, who appeared relatively late\non the historical scene, among others, suffered the same confusion. To them, Saturn was the\nsame pin-point of light we see in our own night sky. They could not therefore understand\nwhy some of their ancestors called this planet Helios since, to them, Helios was the Sun. As\nwe have seen, the belief that Saturn had once been a sun was so ingrained in the minds of our",

Thus, as reported by Varro, while some authorities\ndid identify Janus as the sky, others were just as confident that the deity personified the uni-\nverse.\u2019 This \u201cuniverse,\u201d \u201csky,\u201d and/or \u201cheaven,\u201d however, was the kosmos of the Greeks, a\nterm which literally meant \u201corder,\u201d \u201charmony,\u201d or \u201can orderly arrangement.\u201d Thus Janus was\nconsidered a \u201cgod of beginnings\u201d\u00ae and ascribed \u201can essential role in the creation of the\nworld,\u201d? which creation is a topic we shall have to reserve for a future work. As Janus Pater,\nthe god was revered as the father of the gods!\u00b0 and god of gods. !!\nIn all the above, Janus bears a close similarity to the Saturnian deities of other nations.\nAre we then saying that Janus was the same as Saturn?\nAN OR ANU\nAccording to Cook, the \u201cmost probable etymology\u201d of the name Janus is derived from a\nseries of related names. Thus he tell us that:\n\u201cCorresponding with the series Diviana Diana Iana we have the series Divianus Di-\nanus lanus (the same as Janus]. Janus, therefore, can be legitimately connected with\ndius (for diuios), a word familiar to us in the phrase sub dio, \u2018under the open sky\u2019.\u201d!?\nThis derivation has been picked up and repeated by other scholars!3 but, to me, it seems\nmore likely that the name Janus owes its origin to a primitive root which also gave us the\nSumero-Babylonian An or Anu, the Greek Ouranos, and the Indic Varuna\u2014all of whom\nwere inter alia assimilated with the mythological sky. This primitive root would then have\nbelonged to a time when, in the words of Max Miiller, \u201cSanskrit was not yet Sanskrit, Greek\nnot yet Greek, but when both, together with Latin, German, and other Aryan dialects, existed\nas yet as one undivided language...\u201d !4\nLike Janus, the Sumerian An was considered the father of all the gods!5 and, like the Sat-\nurnian deities of other nations, he always stood at the beginning of every theological list from\nall periods.!\u00a9 To be sure, An and Anu have always been identified as a personification of the",

Rather than being the sky, Anu creates the sky.!9\nBut is this enough to equate the celestial body that was An as Saturn? We dig further.\nThe god An also appears in Egypt. We find him there as an alias of the god Osiris.\u201d In\nthe \u201cLamentations of Isis and Nephthys,\u201d Isis addresses Osiris as An.2! In a hymn to Osiris\nhe is called the \u201cgod An of millions of years.\u201d22 As we have seen, as the sun of night, Osiris\nis identifiable as Saturn as so, also, is his assimilation with both Atum and Ra.

In Greek, ouranos means \u201cheaven\u201d but, as E. Tonnelat indicated,\nthis must not be taken to mean that the god\u2019s original function was the personification of the\nsky.?3 The association of Ouranos with the sky might have derived from the fact that an ear-\nlier name for the god seems to have been Epigeios, that is \u201cthe One who is above the\nearth.\u201d4 Plato himself referred to Ouranos as Kosmos,?5 concerning which see above. It was,\nhowever, the Phoenician Sanchoniathon who directly equated Ouranos with Kronos/Saturn.76\nSo also, more recently, Lynn Rose even though his model is at variance with the one being\nconstructed in this work.?/\nVARUNA\nWe find the Indic version of the Greek Ouranos in the person of Varuna.

All that needs to be\nre-stated here is that, like Janus, with whom we are presently mainly concerned, the above\nseries of gods were all believed to have represented that entity which the Greeks called\nkosmos and which, among modern mythologists, has come down to symbolize the sky or\nheaven. Using the old adage that things which are equal to the same thing must be equal to\none another, one can therefore assume that, since the deities enumerated above are all, to\nsome extent, identifiable as avatars of the Saturnian deity, then so must Janus be identified.\nActually, the above series of identifications has been presented more as an exercise in\ncomparative mythology, and as a basis for coming chapters, than as evidence for the Saturn-\nian identity of Janus since the comparisons are not really required to make our case. As will\nbe seen directly below, we have direct evidence at our disposal.\nSATURNUS\nThat Janus was merely another name for Saturn was known and acknowledged by the\nancients themselves. Thus, in describing the New Year Festival, which we have already seen\naffiliated with the Saturnian planet through the Persian feast of Nauroz, Joannes Lydus had\nthis to say:\n\u201cOur own Philadelphia still preserves a trace of the ancient belief. On the first day of\nthe month [that is January, named after Janus] there goes in procession no less a per-\nsonage than Janus himself, dressed up in a two-faced mask, and people call him Sat-\nurnus, identifying him with Kronos.\u201d38\nHere I must at once state that there is no point in claiming that Janus and Saturnus are\npresented as different deities in the Roman pantheon or that the quote from Lydus is too late,\ndating from the sixth century, for any credence to be attached to it. In the first place, it was\nnot Lydus who called Janus by the name Saturnus. It was, as he tells us, the people who did\nso. In other words, he was reporting general belief. More than that, as Lydus himself stated,\nthe knowledge he imparted still preserved \u201ca trace of the ancient belief,\u201d meaning that the",

As noted earlier, and as has been recognized by others, there is nothing\nstrange about having different deities, even within the same pantheon, as personifying the\nsame celestial object. As far as Janus is concerned, he could be considered an older Saturn\u2014\nCook had no qualms about making him an older Jupiter,3? with which this author naturally\ndisagrees.\nTo be fair, since I mentioned him, Cook did not accept the statement of Lydus\u2014 bur not\nbecause he considered the source as a late one. \u201cThe confusion of Ianus [the same as Janus]\nwith Kronos,\u201d he tells us, \u201cno doubt presupposes the usual blunder Kronos = Chronos [that is\nTime personified], which from the fifth century B.C. onwards queered the course of Greek\ntheology.\u201d4\u00b0\nWhy did Cook bring this point up? He did so because he could not avoid the veneration\nof Janus as a god of time, or Time personified,*! which, through the rules of comparative\nmythology, would equate the Italic deity with the Greek Chronos. But, in the first place, ac-\ncording to Lydus, his countrymen did not call Janus by the name Kronos. They called him by\nthe name Saturnus. The identification with Kronos was added because Kronos was simply\nthe Greek counterpart of the Italic Saturnus. In the second place, as will be indicated in detail\nin a later chapter of this work, the blunder concerning the identification of Kronos/Saturn\nwith Chronos/Time happens to be Cook\u2019s. In fact, as we shall soon see, the identification of\nJanus as Saturn does not rest solely on the statement of Lydus but also on the comparison of\nthis deity\u2019s characteristics with those of the known Saturnian deities of other nations. Thus,\nfor instance, William Heidel speaks of \u201cthe recognized association of Saturn with Janus\u201d 4?",

The implication here is\nclear. If ancient man could remember a time when Saturn appeared as a sphere to the\nunaided eye, Saturn would had to have been closer to Earth.\nTHE DOGON MYSTERY\nAt this point I wish to introduce a few items which archaeoastronmers have found quite\nbewildering. I start with the astronomical knowledge of the Dogon of Mali of what had once\nbeen the French Sudan, in Africa.\nThanks to the writings of Marcel Griaule, Germaine Dieterlen, and Robert Temple, the\nDogon, once a little-known tribe with some very curious rituals, have now been placed on the\ntourist map. But more than their exotic costumes, bizarre masks, dances, and commemorative\nfestivals, these people have become increasingly renowned for their astronomical lore. As\nEdwin Krupp reported:\n\u201cCounting the phases of the moon, keeping track of the configurations of Venus, and\nwatching the arrivals and departures of the stars are all part of Dogon practical as-\ntronomy. The Dogon recognizes 266 stars or asterisms and associate them with 266\npictographic symbols that are painted on rock shelters, altars, and other shrines.\u201d49\nThe Moon, say the Dogon, \u201cis dry and dead like dry dead blood.\u201d>\u00b0 They know that the\nplanets, which they call tolo tanaze \u2014that is \u201cstars that turn (around something)\u201d>! revolve\naround the Sun. They claim that \u201cJupiter follows Venus by turning slowly around the sun.\u201d52\nThey possess four different kinds of calendar\u2014a solar calendar, a lunar calendar, a Venus\ncalendar, and, remarkably, one based on the star known to us as Sirius.\u00b03 Either through in-\ntuition or otherwise, the Dogon are of the belief that an infinite number of stars and an infi-\nnite number of planets, together with their satellites, exist.\nWhat mostly interests us here, however, has to do with what they have to say in relation\nto Saturn. Concerning this planet, the Dogon \u201caffirm there is a permanent halo around the\nstar, different from the one sometimes seen around the moon.\u201d55 Their own drawing of Sat-\nurn actually shows the planet, depicted as a circle, distinctly surrounded by a ring. Saturn is\nalso known to them as \u201cthe star of limiting the place,\u201d which probably alludes to the fact\nthat Saturn is the outermost planet among those visible to the naked eye.\nAs Krupp was later to admit, these astronomical traditions of the Dogon \u201cwere bound to\ncause consternation among astronomers, for it seems impossible to reconcile the Dogon as-\ntronomical knowledge...with their instrumental resources, namely the unaided eye.\u201d57 While\nGriaule and Dieterlen did not, themselves, come to a definite conclusion concerning how the\nDogon came upon their astronomical lore, Robert Temple, who built an edifice on their",

(It has always fascinated me that such extraterrestri-\nals would have bestowed such astronomical knowledge to the ancestors of the Dogon,\nknowledge which was of no practical use to them, while giving them nothing that might have\nalleviated the precarious living of their Stone Age primitiveness.)\nOthers would rather have the Dogon educated in these matters by other sorts of visiting\naliens\u2014Christian missionaries from the West. The missionary campaign in tropical Africa,\nhowever, did not commence in earnest until the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century.\nBut this is neither here nor there because, to be sure, the Sudan, including Mali, had much\nearlier come under the influence of Islam, so that no Christian influence could have pene-\ntrated the region\u2014and this despite the fact that the rural areas, such as the one occupied by\nthe Dogon, continued to stick to their traditional animistic ways.\u00ae! And, in any case, would\nmissionaries, Christian or otherwise, bent on converting primitive peoples to their faith, have\nfilled the minds of these natives with astronomical knowledge? Or why was this knowledge,\nas adhered to by these natives, first reported to the outside world by missionaries who were\nas confounded by the knowledge as were later astronomers?\nOne other alternative that has been proposed is that the ancestors of the Dogon had been\nin possession of optical instruments. However, even Galileo, with his pioneering telescope,\nwas not able to see Saturn as a ringed orb. In fact, the image of Saturn that he was capable of\nresolving through his optical instrument was so vague that he mistook the planet for three\nseparate bodies. As he himself reported:\n\u201cI have observed with great admiration that Saturn is not a single star but three to-\ngether, which, as it were, touch each other...the middle being much larger than the\nlateral ones...by employing a glass which multiplies the superficies [i.e., visible\nboundaries] more than a thousand times, the three globes will be seen very distinctly\nand almost touching, with only a small dark space between them.\u201d &\nIt was not until 1655 that Christian Huygens, with a better instrument, was able to report\n(through his now famous encoded message) that Saturn was actually \u201cgirdled by a thin flat\nring, nowhere touching, inclined to the ecliptic.\u201d\nIs it then probable that the Dogon, who are still living in their primitive mud huts as I\nwrite this, could have been in possession of a better telescope than the one utilized by Gali-\nleo?\nTHE STAR OF NINE MOONS\nThe Efe Pygmies of the Ituri Forest in the eastern portion of Africa\u2019s Congo basin in\nwhat is now Upper Zaire have been unceremoniously relegated by most anthropologists to\nthe lowest rungs of human evolution.

But even if there is a grain of truth in these legends, it still\nwould not have enabled the Efe Pygmies, or their ancestors, to see the satellites surrounding\nthe planet Saturn. So where did that information come from?\nWhen all is said and done, the only other alternative left to explain the Dogon and Efe\nPygmy knowledge of Saturn\u2019s ring structure and its satellites is that their ancestors had, in a\nfar off time, been able to view the planet at closer proximity\u2014which would mean that,\nsomehow, Earth had been much closer to Saturn than it is at present. As outlandish as this\nidea may appear, there seems to be no other resolution to the problem\u2014which brings to mind\nthe oft-repeated words of Arthur Conan Doyle: \u201cWhen you have eliminated the impossible,\nwhatever remains, however improbable, has to be the truth.\u201d7! Besides, as forthcoming\nchapters will indicate, everything else that our ancient forefathers had to say about this planet\ncontinues to strengthen the supposition.\nTHIRD INTERLUDE\nScience has forgotten Oskar Reichenbach who, as far back as 1884, had proposed a the-\nory purporting to prove that land masses on Earth have rifted and moved northward.\u201d His\nideas can therefore be said to have preceded the similar ones of Alfred Wegener, himself rel-\negated to a footnote in the annals of science as the originator of the Continental Drift Theory,\nby some 33 years. But, more than that, Reichenbach was of the belief that, in the past, the So-\nlar System had experienced a series of catastrophic events.\u201d? Basing his conclusions on the\nimperfect knowledge of his time, he had also formulated certain theories concerning the\nplanet Saturn. As wrong as he might have been, and I am not here concemed with defending\nReichenbach, he hit on the novel idea that Earth is \u201can offspring of Saturn,\u201d\u201d4 by which he\nmeant to imply that Earth had once been a satellite of the giant gas planet.\nReichenbach, he hit on the novel idea that Earth is \u201can offspring of Saturn,\u201d74 by which he\nWhether Immanuel Velikovsky was aware of Reichenbach\u2019s wild theory or not must\nremain a moot question but, many years later, he, too, came to the same conclusion.

At one\ntime, because of the manner in which he was treated by academia, Velikovsky threatened to\ntake his Saturnian thesis with him to the grave but, as matters turned out, reason prevailed\nand he was able to expand and finalize his hypothesis under the title of Saturn and the Flood\nand Jupiter of the Thunderbolt, a title which was later changed to In the Beginning. As of this\nwriting, this work still has to see the light of day.\n\nIn 1971, however, Velikovsky gave a lecture at the University of the New World in\nValais, Switzerland, in which he presented a synopsis of his unpublished Saturnian scenario.\nAmong the items he disclosed there was the hypothesis that Earth might once have been a\nsatellite of Saturn.7> The lecture was later transcribed by Jan Sammer and appeared as an ar-\nticle in KRONOS.7\u00a9\n\nIndependent of Velikovsky, but basing their work on his as also on the mytho-historical\nrecord, Harold Tresman and Bernard Newgrosh (writing under the name of Brendan\nO\u2019Gheoghan), also came to the conclusion that Earth must once have orbited Saturn as a\nsatellite,\u201d\u2019 a topic to which Tresman was later to return.78\n\nIn analyzing the ambiguous, but tantalizing, planetary system proposed by Philolaos, the\nPythagorean philosopher from Southern Italy who lived in the time of Socrates, Lynn Rose\ncame to the same conclusion. Although this system of Philolaos had long been relegated to\nthe library of Classical curiosities, Rose was able to recapture what it might have once in-\ntended to portray. Although what resulted was a Saturnian scenario the details of which are at\nvariance with the one being presented here, it still contains some of its basic elements. As\nRose explained: \u201cAccording to the conventional interpretation, the system of Philolaos had\nEarth in orbit around a Central Fire...\u201d79 Since the Sun was described as orbiting this Central\nFire\u00ae\u00b0 it becomes obvious that the Central Fire could not have been the Sun. An in-depth\nstudy of this system, together with his privileged knowledge of Velikovsky\u2019s unpublished\nwork on the subject, enabled Rose to conclude that this Central Fire was Saturn shining as a\n\u201csun,\u201d and that Earth was in those days in orbit around it.!\n\nCombining Velikovsky\u2019s postulate with that of David Talbott and others, Frederick Hall\nembraced the same idea, presenting it in a speculative scenario concerning the history of the\nSolar System.\u00ae2\n\nCertain fundamentals, based on specific proposals offered by others, are here accepted,\nbut also tested against the record. The hypothesis that Earth had once been a satellite of Sat-\nurn, which originally came to this author via Velikovsky, is one of them. Additional research\nconducted independently by the present author has led to the same conclusion. This research\nhas however made it apparent that prehistoric man, ignorant of astronomical matters, would\nnot have been able to deduce that his world was a satellite of another planet. But, being close\nenough to Saturn, he would have been able to view that planet as something much bigger\nthan the present pin-point of light we see in the night sky. Saturn, in fact, would have loomed\nlarge in the sky as a disk, or sphere, much larger than that of the present full Moon. And this",

The model was based on the\nassumption that Newton was right in attributing all of the motions to the effect of\ngravity alone, and it was limited to a consideration of the major bodies alone\u2014the\nmain planetary bodies plus the Sun. The thirty or so other major bodies [since then\nmany more], in the form of the main satellites of the planets, were ignored.\u201d3\nAnd:\n\u201cLaplace, himself, fully appreciated the limitations of his model, and he recognized\nthat it was quite possible for the system to become disturbed, either as a result of the",

While these are processes which are thought to take millions of years, the important\nthing to remember, for the time being, is that the new Science of Chaos shows beyond a reas-\nonable doubt that the Solar System is not the \u201cparagon of predictability that was once imag-\nined,\u201d!0 and that Laplace\u2019s deterministic world view no longer holds. What now turns up is\nthat resonance pervades the Solar System and that it probably acts through tidal effects. As\nfurther computer retrocalculations conducted by Archie Roy and his team have shown, the\norbits of the smaller bodies of the Solar System are actually chaotic and unpredictable. !!\nAnd then, in a study of planetary perturbations performed by John Bagby, it was found\nthat such computer simulations as the ones described above are not, of themselves, reliable\nbeyond a certain length of time. As he had it stated: \u201cI found that every outer planet all the\nway in to at least Mars, was so perturbed by some as yet unmodeled cause that their orbits\nneeded to be computerized every ten years.\u201d\nWhile Bagby\u2019s simulations had to do with the outer planets, as opposed to the orbits of\nthe inner ones simulated by Sussman, Roy, et al, it should be noted that Mars was included in\nboth studies.",

Would this law not be violated had Earth once been a satellite of Saturn?\n\nBode\u2019s Law was actually discovered by Johann Daniel Titius of Wittenberg, Germany, in\n1772. But because it was brought to prominence by Johann Elert Bode, another German as-\ntronomer\u2014some say actually stolen by him!+\u2014it has become known by his name.\n\nWhat is this law?\n\nIn order of distances, the planets of the Solar System moving outward from the Sun are\nMercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. What Titius dis-\ncovered was that if we take the number 3, double it, then double the result, and keep on\ndoubling in that manner, we end up with the series 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, etc. Adding 4 to each\nof these numbers results in the series 7, 10, 16, 28, 52, 100, etc. If we then divide each of\nthese numbers by 10, we finally end up with -7, 1, 1-6, 2-8, 5-2, 10, and so on. What is ex-\ntraordinary about this final series is that it turns out to be in fair agreement with the actual\nmean distances of each planet from the Sun, still moving outward, when measured in astron-\nomical units. !5\n\nWhere this law was at first thought to fail was in its fourth placement, since there is no\nplanet to be found at 2-8 astronomical units from the Sun. But then, when the asteroid belt\nwas discovered between Mars and Jupiter close enough to this position, Bode\u2019s Law became\nengraved in granite\u2014never mind that the law breaks completely down when it comes to\nNeptune and Pluto.\n\nIt was then \u201cestablished\u201d that the effects of this law had manifested themselves early in\nthe history of the Solar System. But, in 1960, Robert Bass demonstrated mathematically that\nplanets tend to space themselves in a Bode\u2019s Law type series of orbits, by what he termed the\nPrinciple of Least Mean Potential Energy,'\u00a9 even if initially disturbed. Thus the Bode for-\nmula\u2014for that is all it really is\u2014reveals absolutely nothing about the original spacing of the\nSolar System planets. This was validated in 1968 by the then Soviet theoretician A. M.\nMolchanov, who claimed that Bode\u2019s Law is actually the result of orbital resonances and that\nit could not be of primeval origin.!7 This was again stressed seven years later by Michael\nOvenden, who renamed Bass\u2019 earlier axiom as the Principle of Least Interaction Action,\nwhen he reached a conclusion identical to Molchanov\u2019s\u2014\u201cthat the present distribution of the\nplanetary and satellite orbits is the result of mutual perturbations.\u201d!8 What Ovenden deter-",

Hills computed simulations of the N-body problem and discovered that\n\u201carbitrary planetary configurations, started with purely random initial positions and veloci-\nties, tend, during a few thousand to a few hundred thousand subsequent years, to \u2018relax\u2019 into\na Bode\u2019s-law type of resonant configuration.\u201d2\u00b0 So much, then, for \u201cmillions of years.\u201d\nNow it is true that the planetary system that relaxed the fastest in Hills\u2019 simulations, at\nsomething like 2000 years, consisted of the Sun with four planets, each of which contained\nten times the mass of the Jovian planets\u2014hardly a portrait of our Solar System. However, the\nactual planetary composition of this simulation is not the central issue being discussed here.\nWhat is important to keep in mind is that Hills showed that, under certain conditions, planets\ncan relax into a Bode\u2019s Law type of configuration within a comparatively short time. And\nthis is important because, up to then, this had generally been thought to be\nimpossible\u2014which, if nothing else, proves that what is thought to be impossible in\nastronomy today may be thought of as being quite possible tomorrow.\nActually, as Bass informed his readers in 1974,?! the phenomenon discovered by Hills\nwas foreseen by Emest Brown as early as 1931 2? but no one seems to have paid him any\nheed.\nWhat all this implies is that Bode\u2019s Law is an empiricism based on the present spacing of\nthe planets. Lynn Rose explained it best:\n\u201cTt is usually not the case that mathematical gimmickry comes first, and that an inven-\ntory of the heavens is taken later. Usually the heavenly body count comes first, and\nthe tissue of mathematical rationalization is developed later. Thus Kepler first consid-\nered that there were six bodies orbiting the Sun\u2014Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,\nJupiter, and Saturn [since the rest had not yet been discovered]\u2014and then invented\nhis scheme involving the five regular solids to explain why there could be only those\nsix bodies. And in the eighteenth century, when Titius was working on his law and\nBode was stealing it, the properties of the known bodies were examined first, and\nthen the artificial mathematical formula\u2014now known as \u2018 Bode\u2019s Law\u2019 \u2014was devel-\noped in an effort to rationalize what was already known.\u201d3\nIn fact, one of the most reputable encyclopedias of astronomy has it stated that \u201cthe\nTitius-Bode Law...is most probably a mere coincidence.\u201d*4\nBe that as it may, when it comes to the actual Solar System, Hills\u2019 above-described\nmodel suggested to him that a reasonable estimate for the relaxation of the Jovian planets\ninto their present orbits would be between 100,000 and a million years. Thus, while it may be\npointed out that Bass himself was more concerned with the orbital crossings of an erratic\nVenus as proposed by Immanuel Velikovsky, which does not concern us here, than he was\nwith the Jovian giants, Hills\u2019 conclusion may be said to bode disaster for the Saturnian scen-\nario being proposed here. After all, a hundred thousand to a million years would hardly place\nour posited event within human memory.",

This, also, is important because, according to point-particle Newtonian\nmechanics, the relaxation of planets into resonant orbits would be reversible. It was for this\nreason that, despite Ovenden\u2019s own disclaimer,25 Bass suggested the inclusion of tidal fric-\ntion as this would be one way of breaking this reversing tendency. Hills, as later Ovenden,\nsaw no reason to take this drag into consideration. Had they done so, their results would have\nbeen entirely different. As Bass indicated, the addition of tidal friction \u201ccould put the planets\non to vastly different orbits.\u201d27\nPersonally, I will not claim that tidal friction, or tidal friction alone, would resolve the\nSaturnian problem. In the meantime, however, it should be kept in mind that Bass was not re-\nlying on Hills\u2019 discovery as much as he was on an adaptation of it.\nEventually, Ovenden\u2019s Principle of Least Interaction Action failed in predicting the pres-\nent orbits of the Jovian planets. Ovenden could only save his Principle by postulating the\none-time existence of an additional massive object and then getting rid of it at some point in\ntime. According to this postulate\u2014which, at first glance, should seem wilder than the one\nbeing proposed in this work\u2014the Solar System has still not reached equilibrium? (which\nreminds us very much of Bagby\u2019s postulate concerning his undiscovered planet as the cause\nfor planetary perturbations). Ovenden placed the catastrophe which got rid of his one-time\nplanet at 16 million (1.6 X 107) years ago, while also stating that it would take something\nlike another 280 million (2.8 X 108) years for the Solar System to reach complete equilibrium\n(thus allowing his Principle of Least Interaction Action to fulfill itself). Since, however, I am\nhere only concerned with the past and present orbits of the planets, Ovenden\u2019s 280 million\nyears of future orbital re-adjustments are irrelevant to our case. But we will take note that, ac-\ncording to Ovenden, the present near-equilibrium of the Solar System is not its final\nstage\u2014that, in fact, the Solar System is still adjusting to a relatively recent planetary shuffle.\nNeedless to say, it will again be pointed out that an event which supposedly occurred 16\nmillion years ago is hardly \u201crecent.\u201d But let us not get carried away just yet because one\nthing that Ovenden himself stressed takes the wind out of the above objection.\n\u201c...if it can be shown that processes operate within the solar system that can rearrange\nthe planetary orbits on a sufficiently short time-scale then we must conclude that the\npresent distribution of planetary and satellite orbits contain no information about\nconditions at the time of formation of the solar system.\u201d29\nThis was expanded on later by Archie Roy when he wrote:\n\u201cWe have seen that the work of J. G. Hills and M. W. Ovenden demonstrated that af-\nter a short period of wild behaviour, a planetary system could settle down into a dis-\ntribution of orbits very similar to a commensurable Bode-type configuration. Such a\nconfiguration would, under the action of other forces such as tidal friction, nudge the\nsystem into a neighbouring truly stable configuration, which on inspection might be",

And, on this issue, the historical record seems to be clear enough even if\nstill unrecognized by most conventionalists.\nRETROACTIVE CALCULATIONS\nWhat then of retroactive calculations (or retrocalculations, for short)? Retrocalculation \u201cis\nthe method which relies on the assumption that the Earth has been behaving in a nice sedate\nuniformitarian manner, and it is assumed that it is possible to calculate backwards in time to\nestablish the exact date of astronomical events.\u201d3\u00a2 Do not such calculations prove that no\nchange in the orbits or placements of the planets have taken place in the past? No, they do\nnot. As Leroy Ellenberger indicated when he was still a Velikovskian catastrophist: \u201cNo\nretro-calculations to date have been inherently capable of duplicating near-collisions [among\nthe planets] even if one occurred.\u201d37 William Mullen, too, observed that such retrocalcul-\nations are futile since they involve \u201ca problem rather like taking the position of a few billiard-\nballs towards the end of the game and calculating the positions of the complete set back to\nthe beginning.\u201d38 Or, as Warlow pointed out: \u201cIn fact, as far as the stability of the system is\nconcemed, there are experts in the field today who admit that, if we take the system in its\npresent state, it is only reasonable to calculate forward or backward in time for about three",

The \u2018Mercury as Venus\u2019s Moon\u2019 theory explains at one\nstroke many observations, such as the reduced/reversed spin of Venus, its massive\natmosphere, the 2/3 spin resonance of Mercury, the oblate shape of Mercury, and\nmany more.\u201d48\nGeorge Wetherhill posited an even wilder scenario for Mercury in which the planet had\noriginally orbited the Sun at Earth\u2019s present distance. Then, according to this particular the-\nory, Mercury was involved in a violent collision in which the planet was melted. A second\ncollision then resulted in the stripping away of Mercury\u2019s crust and its ejection out of its or-\nbit. Deflected from its path by Earth\u2019s gravity field, together with that of Venus, Mercury\neventually settled down into its present circular track.4\nAlan Stern, on the other hand, came out with a proposition of satellite capture, rather than\nescape. Not that the capture of satellites by planets had not been propounded before. But this\none deals with the planet Neptune and its companion, Triton, a moon the size of the planet\nPluto. Triton, it was found out, orbits Neptune in what astronomers call \u201cthe wrong direc-\ntion,\u201d that is clockwise as seen from \u201cabove,\u201d when all other satellites revolve counterclock-\nwise. The most likely explanation for this, according to Stern, is that Triton had once orbited\nfreely but, passing too close to Neptune, was captured by the larger planet as its moon.\nSo, similarly, with the planet Pluto which, until 1978, was still believed to be without a\nmoon. But a later ground-based photograph of Pluto revealed the presence of a\nsatellite\u2014since then named Charon\u2014 orbiting the planet. Because Charon is larger than our\nMoon, and one third as large as Pluto itself, Stern has said that it is \u201creally more accurate to\ncall this a double planet.\u201d>! Stern is thus of the opinion that these two planets had also once\norbited freely but that, coming too close, they managed to capture each other.52\nBut what of Earth itself? Has anyone before us ever posited that it, too, may have shifted?\nTHE SHIFTING EARTH\nAs Tom Yulsman reported:\n\u201cWe like to think that the Earth\u2019s orbit and the shape of its magnetic field are\nchangeless\u2014that as the years pass, the planet follows a rock-steady route about the\nSun while the compass points resolutely north. Not only is this not true, but scientists",

Both orbit and magnetic field indeed\nchange...\u201d53\nWe will not concern ourselves here with the change in Earth\u2019s magnetic field, nor will we\nconcern ourselves much with what led to this \u201cdiscovery\u201d beyond the shortest of synopses.\nWhat is at the bottom of it is the conclusion reached by the geologist Madeline Briskin in her\ninvestigation of seafloor core samples. Sediment has always been deemed a reliable indicator\nof past climatic conditions. What Briskin discovered through the age and molecular design of\nthe ocean fossils imbedded in the sediments she studied, led her to conclude that Earth\u2019s cli-\nmate follows a repetitive cycle of changes of approximately 413,000 years duration. This\ncycle, according to her, is brought about by Earth\u2019s changing orbit as it moves closer to, then\nfarther away from, the Sun. As far as the present work is concerned, no judgment will be\npassed on the possible validity or otherwise of this deduction. We merely note it as one indi-\ncation of various theories from the establishment in which changes in Earth\u2019s orbit are de-\nduced from certain evidences and made to account for certain past situations.\nAre any of these scenarios any wilder than one which posits Earth to be an escaped satel-\nlite of Saturn? Ah yes\u2014but the above events, whether they ever transpired or not, have all\nbeen dated to millions of years ago as opposed to the scenario being presented here which\nclaims Earth to have still been a satellite of Saturn during the advent of man. This is an ob-\njection we will be running into time and again.\nIn 1986, Lynn Rose, who, with Raymond Vaughan, had been working on the Babylonian\nNinsianna tablets, surprised Velikovsky\u2019s followers by correcting their earlier conclusion,\nand that of Velikovsky himself, concerning the not-so-ancient orbit of the planet Venus. In\n1950, Velikovsky had been of the opinion that the astronomical observations contained in\nthese tablets\u2014sometimes referred to as the Tablets of Ammizadugqa, sometimes simply as the\nVenus tablets\u2014showed beyond a reasonable doubt that Venus had been moving on an en-\ntirely different orbit at the time the observations were conducted.\u00b0> Originally concurring\nwith him, Rose and Vaughan eventually came to an entirely different conclusion.\n\u201cLike many others, including Velikovsky, we at one time took it for granted that the\nVenus tablets would tell us about a radically different orbit of Venus...We have grad-\nually come to realize, however, that at the time of the observations Venus might have\nbeen on or close to its present orbit...The strangeness of these eighth-century [B.C.]\nobservations of Venus seems to be mainly due to their having been made from an\nEarth that was on a radically different orbit from the present orbit of Earth.\u201d5\nIn 1993, Michael Reade came to similar conclusions,*\u2019 although the amount in Earth\u2019s\norbital expansion as given by him\u2014from a posited 0.9904 AU to the present 1.000\nAU\u2014would not lend itself to being called radical, representing a mere 0.97% to 1%\nexpansion. \u00b08",

I\nmerely mention them as the possible\u2014even probable\u2014fall-out of a set of Babylonian astro-\nnomical observations. On the other hand, I shall have more to say about this particular datum,\nbut in a future work which will deal with the attainment of Earth\u2019s present orbital path.\n\nTHE HABITABLE ZONE\n\nAn entirely different problem that our hypothesis raises concerns the distance of Earth\nfrom the Sun during the time it spent as a satellite of Saturn. It has, for instance, been pointed\nout that, were it not for the insulation provided by its atmosphere, Earth\u2019s temperature would\nfall well below the freezing point of water, similar to that of the Moon. And that would be at\nEarth\u2019s present distance from the Sun. What, then, would Earth\u2019s temperature have been at\nSaturn\u2019s present distance from the Sun\u2014insulating atmosphere or not? This is most impor-\ntant because, needless to say, Earth\u2019s temperature has a direct bearing on the sustenance of\nlife. The existence of life on Earth, it has often been stated, is manifestly due to our planet\u2019s\ndistance from the Sun\u2014it just happens to be positioned in the Sun\u2019s habitable zone\u2014which\nis the reason why it is the only planet in the Solar System capable of bearing life.\n\nEarth, it should be remembered, is at 1 AU from the Sun (approximately 93 million\nmiles). Saturn is at 9.5 AU from the Sun (approximately 886.3 million miles). As a satellite\nof Saturn, would not Earth have been in the \u201cfreeze zone\u201d? How, then, could it have sus-\ntained life, including that of man?\n\nWhat, exactly, is the extent of the Sun\u2019s habitable zone? At one time the habitable zone\nwas believed to stretch between 0.7 and 1.3 AU. In 1977, however, Michael Hart reduced\nthis zone to the narrow range extending from 0.95 to 1.01 AU.\u00ae This would still have meant\nthat had Earth been 5% closer to the Sun, its oceans would evaporate; had it been only 1%\nfurther away, total glaciation would put an end to life. But then, in 1988, the scientists at\nNASA\u2019s Ames centre found reason to increase the distance of the habitable zone by 50%.\n\nLife, however, requires more than the right amount of heat and sun-light. It also requires\nwater, of which Earth has an abundance. But now here\u2019s the rub. Long-range exploration of\nthe planets has convinced astronomers that Venus and Mars also once possessed abundant\nwater. In the case of Venus, its water is said to have evaporated into space because of its\ncloser proximity to the Sun.\u00ae! This mechanism, however, does not work for Mars which is\nfarther out from the Sun than is Earth. An entirely different process had therefore to be\nworked out for the red planet. As James Kasting wrote: \u201cMars is freeze-dried today, not be-\ncause it is too far from the sun but because it is a small planet and therefore cooled off com-\nparatively quickly.\u201d62\n\nAll this has led to the belief that the habitable zone, which has now been revised to range\n\u201cfrom just inside the orbit of Earth to beyond the orbit of Mars,\u201d has \u201cmigrated slowly out-\nward from its position when the planets first formed...about 4.6 billion years ago, because\nthe sun has gradually brightened over time.\u201d What this additionally entails is that in an-\nother billion years, as the Sun continues to brighten and becomes ever hotter, Earth\u2019s orbit",

Maybe not, but, theoretically at least, could we not perhaps shift Saturn into\nthe habitable zone?

And even then, do we really need Saturn\u2019s tidal pull in order to heat\nEarth? Have we not already seen that Saturn radiates more heat than it actually receives from\nthe Sun? Can not this excessive heat be seen as the residue from a time when Saturn was\nmuch hotter? Have we not, on the strength of the mytho-historical record, posited that Saturn\nhad once been a miniature sun radiating its own heat and light?

What Wescott referred to as Aster is to us the planet\nSaturn.\nIf this had really been the case\u2014in other words, had Saturn been the only celestial body\nvisible from Earth during the indeterminate time with which we are concerned\u2014it would add\neven more to the ancient belief that Saturn had been the most prominent heavenly body that\ncould be seen in Earth\u2019s primordial sky. Think about it: We have seen that Earth had been a\nsatellite of what is now the planet Saturn, which planet was described as having been near\nenough to Earth to be remembered as a sphere, which sphere, in turn, was described as a sun\nthat shone at night during a time when no other heavenly body could be seen.

No other deity existed with him or before him.\nPRAJAPATI\nWe have already seen the Indic Brahma, known as the \u201cfather of gods and men,\u201d identi-\nfied as Saturn through the name Brahmanyah. In that respect, it is noteworthy that Brahma is\nconsidered to have been the first of the Devas, which term is understood as meaning\n\u201cdeities,\u201d but which, in effect, means the \u201cshining ones,\u201d\u201d an apt term for heavenly bodies. It\nis therefore telling that Brahma, too, was described as having originally been alone: \u201cHe hov-\ners, alone, above everything.\u201d\u2122\nAn epithet, usually translated to mean \u201cLord of Creatures,\u201d\u201d by which Brahma was\nknown is Prajapati.\u201d This is so true that, in the Vishnu Purana, Prajapati is given as an addi-\ntional name for Brahma.\u201d Like others of the Saturnian deities we have been examining,\nPrajapati was also referred to as \u201cthe One God.\u201d\u201d\nPrajapati\u2019s identity as Saturn does not solely rely on that of Brahma. As the 11th century\nA.D. Arabian scholar, Al-Biruni, discovered during his travels in India, the Lord of Saturn is\ncalled Prajapati\u2014pure and simple.*\nIt should therefore not surprise us that, in distinction to Brahma, who was actually his\nown self, Prajapati was believed to have originally ruled alone. This we find in the Satapatha\nBrahmana which, among other matters, states that \u201cPrajapati alone, indeed, existed here in\nthe beginning.\u201d\u2122\nFOUR FROM THE \u201cPRIMITIVE\u201d WORLD\nThe doctrinal conviction we have been investigating is to be found not only among the\ngreat faiths of the ancient world, but also among more primitive peoples.\nAmong the American Indians of the north-west, the creator was known as Raven. But\nhere we have to differentiate between two Ravens. Most tales concerning Raven present this\nmysterious being as a shape-shifter and trickster who was often meddling with what had been\ncreated, even though he himself was also responsible for creating certain elements. As a\nmeddler, shape-shifter, and trickster, Raven is identifiable as a personification of the planet",

Those who hold to this\nby David Rohl in his sensational attempt to rewrite ancient history.\u2019 Those who hold to this\nview usually point with pride to the Mesopotamian Gilgamesh, a supposed king of Uruk, and\nthe Egyptian Imhotep, architect to King Djoser, as prime examples of their evidence. But that\nGilgamesh was anything but a historical person has finally been established beyond a reason-\nable doubt, once and for all, by Ev Cochrane,\u201d while the case of Imhotep is somewhat\nunique. The first builder of a pyramid\u2014a stepped one to be sure\u2014later dynasts were so im-\npressed by Imhotep\u2019s accomplishments that he was elevated to the stature of a god. This is\nnot to be wondered at because, after all, the Egyptian pharaohs themselves were all looked\nupon as living gods. We do not, however, encounter Imhotep in any mythological themes, let\nalone any of a cosmogonic nature. For whatever it is worth, and Rohl notwithstanding, the\nbelief that the ancient gods were really deified historical persons, never adhered to by many,\nis now accepted by even less. On the contrary, the reverse is true, in that some of the\nprimeval deities were eventually demythologized and presented in human garb even by the\nancients themselves.\u201d\nOur own hypothesis, as presented in this work, holds to the view that the concept of deity\nowes its origin to the planets, especially the planet Saturn, and not to such invented spirits,\nghosts, demons, or historical persons as described above. I am not here asserting that the\nmysteries of everyday life, as they pertained to our primitive forebears, were not conducive\nof the myth-making process. But to say that our ancestors were more concerned with the\nthreatening character of everyday life, such as flood, famine, earthquakes, and the like, is to\ngo against what they themselves told us concerning their beliefs. If the truth need be known,\neven such calamities as enumerated above were often connected with the planetary deities,\nand they were so connected by the ancients themselves. Thus, to give but a few examples:\nAmong the Incas, Saturn was considered the god of famine.\u00ae* Almost throughout the entire\nworld, Mars was considered the god of pestilence.\u201d Venus was associated with fear, dark-\nness and death.\u201d The Babylonians, moreover, never discarded their belief that even earth-\nquakes were actually caused by the planets.*\nquakes were actually caused by the planets.  st\nAdherents of the animistic theory, however, base their concepts of the origin of religion\non the beliefs of present primitive peoples, rather than the civilized nations of the ancient\nworld. But even there, their theory meets with various objections. Consider, for instance, the\nEfe pygmies of the Ituri forest whom we had occasion to mention in a previous chapter.\nThese pygmies do not cower in fear of thunder and lightning. Their lives are not ruled, or ter-\nrorized, by a squadron of jungle spirits that have to be appeased every time a calamity hits",

Do they not still throw live\nchickens into volcanic craters in Java,\u201d and pour gin, in lieu of awa, to Pele in America\u2019s\nfiftieth state, as endeavors meant to pacify the destructive force exhibited by volcanoes?\u201d\nDoes any of this negate the fact that the countries in question also pay homage to a higher\ndeity dictated by whatever religion these societies adhere to? Why, then, could not primitive\nplanetary worship have co-existed with a more down-to-earth animism?\n\nAs research implies, residual planetary worship continues to saturate the most primitive\nbeliefs up to the present, as exemplified by the religion of the Efe pygmies mentioned above.\nNor must this particular example be viewed as unique. Space does not here permit anything\nclose to a fair sampling of such cases but I could easily have included a catalogue of similar\nresidues found embedded in the beliefs of such people as the Dogon of the Sudan, which is\npresent-day Mali, the astronomical lore of whom we have already discussed in a previous\nchapter; the Negroes of Mozambique; the Bambala of the Congo; the Bushongo; and many\nother tribes from the African heartland. The mythology of Oceania is likewise saturated with\nresidual planetary worship as is that of the Inuit from Alaska to Greenland. None of these\nprimitive societies, and others like them, can be said to be astronomically adept, yet, when\ntraced to their basic fundamentals, the roots of their religious beliefs exhibit an uncanny simi-\nlarity to the planetary motifs found scattered among the more sophisticated early civilizations\nof man. True, demons and nature spirits also abound, but none of these play a cosmogonic\nrole or hold a prominent place in the complex religious rituals performed by these societies.\n\nStudents of religion will tell us that logic dictates that man would have first endowed\nwhat he could see around him with spiritual life before he would have done likewise with the\nfar away planets. But, in that case, should he not have looked upon the Sun and the Moon as",

Could he then have believed that rivers and trees\nand wind and thunder were animated by spirits before he believed similarly of the most com-\nforting object he was aware of \u2014the Sun?\nGiven that the Sun and the Moon are much more conspicuous than the planets, theirs\nshould have been the major role in primitive mythology. How is it then that, while not always\nreadily obvious from cursory studies, the prime protagonists were invariably the planets and\nplanet-induced phenomena?\nThis poses something of a conundrum to those who view mythology through uniformitar-\nian eyes, one that has already been commented on by Immanuel Velikovsky\u2122 and David\nTalbott.\u201d The riddle, however, is solved when we discover, as in fact the sources themselves\nconvincingly illustrate, that the planets, or at least some of them, prime among them the\nplanet Saturn, were once more conspicuous than Sun and Moon.\nOnce this is accepted, as it is by an ever-growing body of neo-catastrophists, it becomes\nmuch easier to accept that before man had developed an awareness of the heavenly bodies,\nhe had no gods at all.\nThis would seem to lead to the assumption that early man lived for long ages before he\ndiscovered his first god but the fruits of research indicate otherwise. In the first place, one\nmust stop thinking of the planets in this instance as mere pin-points of light in the night sky.\nIt should by now have become obvious to the readers of this work that man\u2019s earliest mem-\nory of the planets is one that hints at recognizable orbs hanging low in the sky.\nAs we have thus far seen, originally there seems to have been only one such orb visible in\nthe sky\u2014the planet Saturn. Mankind, it now seems, discovered its identity under the close\ninfluence of this planetary body which is why the Saturnian deity, in his many guises, is to be\nfound at the head of every major pantheon throughout the ancient civilized world.\nThis primeval Saturn entered man\u2019s memory first as a passive entity which was originally\nlooked upon with neither fear nor awe. But, as I intend to show in a future work, this was not\nto remain so. In time, a series of events transpired which so impressed the human mind that\nSaturn became, for man, the very centre of his environment, his ever-increasing awe and,\neventually, the deduced reason for his very being. Given all this, while not wishing to borrow\ncredence, what would be so difficult in accepting that (a) man\u2019s original deity was a plane-\ntary body and that (b) prime among these deified bodies was the planet Saturn?\nThe question, of course, is simply this: Is there any proof that any of this transpired? So\nlet me be quite honest. If proof is what we are after, it is not forthcoming\u2014any more than\nproof to the contrary is. But the evidence now at hand, which we shall continue to present, is\nmore than enough to upset antiquated views of man\u2019s emergence as a religious being and\nquite capable of upholding this new, if revolutionary, theory.\nKARR KR ROR KK ROK\nORR OK ROK ROK KOK KKK\nFurther evidence concerning our proposition that, during the indeterminate period with\nwhich we are concerned, Saturn was the only celestial body visible from Earth will be pre-\nsented in following chapters.

It seems, however, that there is more to this \u201cresting\u201d business than meets the\neye. Or why would the planet in question have been named for that particular day, thus also\nreceiving the meaning of \u201crest\u201d?\nThe connection of Saturn with the Creation is not restricted to Hebrew tradition.

The only points of validity that he mentioned is the well known\nassociation of the Jewish Sabbath with Saturn and the fact that this planetary deity had long\nbeen known as the god of repose, that is of rest.!2 But, if we discount the derivation of the\nname Shabtai from the business of Elohim\u2019s rest after Creation, what can we offer by way of\nan explanation for this unusual characteristic? Or, why was the planet Saturn called the\nResting Star or Planet?\nTHE GOD OF THE JEWS\nThe Israelite connection with the planet Saturn goes beyond the naming of the Sabbath\nafter this planetary deity. Thus, for instance, when the prophet Amos was riling against the\nIsraelites, he accused them of having carried images of a stellar deity in a tabernacle. The\nKing James version of the passage in question is made to read:\n\u201cHave ye offered...sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of\nIsrael? But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the\nstar of your god, which ye made to yourselves.\u201d 3\nThis memory was still vivid in the days of the New Testament and is repeated in the Acts\nof the Apostles where the figure of Chiun is replaced with that of Remphan:\n\u201c...O ye house of Israel, have ye offered...slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of\nforty years in the wilderness? Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star\nof your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them...\u201d !4\nThis is in keeping with the Septuagint version of the same passage which reads:\n\u201cHave ye offered...victims and sacrifices, O house of Israel, forty years in the wilder-\nness? Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Rephan, the\nimages of them which ye made for yourselves.\u201d\nThe forty years in the wilderness alluded to in the above verses refer to the wandering of\nthe Israelites following their departure, or exodus, from Egypt under Moses. Concerning the\ndeity called Moloch we will offer nothing here, reserving the topic for a future work. Here I\nwish to concentrate on the god called Chiun in one version and Remphan/Rephan in the oth-\ners. Who was this deity? In both Amos and Acts this god is alluded to as \u201cthe star of your\ngod\u201d \u2014that is the star of the Israelites\u2019 god. But what star did Remphan personify?\nIn the Testament of Solomon, Remphan is rendered Raphan concerning whom Solomon\nwas said to have built a temple in conjunction with one to Baal/Moloch.!5 The Testament of\nSolomon is of Jewish origin but, as Louis Ginzberg informs us, as we now have it, it is laden\n\u201cwith many Christian layers.\u201d!\u00a9 This is noted here because the name Raphan (or Ramphan or\nRephan) is unknown in Hebrew and must therefore have been introduced, or transliterated,\nby one of the Christian editors.

In more recent years, for instance, Carl Jung\nknew very well that Saturn was the star of Israel.22 Much earlier, Aurelius Augustinus was\nmore explicit when he informed his readers that the ancients considered the planet Saturn as\nthe god of the Jews. Throughout the Middle Ages, the Jews were largely known as the\nPeople of Saturn\u201d (as so, incidentally, were the Scythians?5). This belief, however, is much\nolder than that since even the Roman historian Tacitus (c. A.D. 55-117) described the Jews as\nworshipping the planet Saturn as their god.26\n\nWhether the tabernacle in question was the acclaimed one that Moses was said to have\nhad constructed, and in which the famed ark of the covenant was housed, remains a moot\nquestion. This much, however, should be stated: While the tabernacle which Moses had had\nbuilt is usually referred to as the Mishkan and/or the Ohel, the tabernacle mentioned in the\nHebrew version of Amos is simply called sukot, the plural of suka, meaning \u201ctents.\u201d\n\nTHE TROUBLE WITH AMOS\n\nScholars of the Jewish faith have, naturally enough, found much to criticize in the above\ninterpretation of the Amosian verse in question.\u2019 As it has been said, this \u201cis a difficult verse\nand the subject of very diverse interpretation\u201d ?\u00ae \u2014or, as M. Weinfeld put it, a verse on which\nmany a pen has been broken,\u201d (although, in my opinion, his has fared no better). This diffi-\nculty is not abated by the fact that the Hebrew \u2014that is Masoretic\u2014version of the passage in\nquestion replaces Moloch with Siccuth (or Sikut, Sikkut) while placing the event as coming\nin the future rather than having occurred in the past. Thus: \u201cSo shall you take up Siccuth your\nking and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.\u201d",

The reading \u201cthe suka of your\nMoloch\u201d is rendered as \u201cSiccuth your melek\u201d \u2014that is, \u201cSiccuth your king.\u201d This, in turn, was\nbased on the assumption that Siccuth is the same name of the Assyrian god Sakkuth.3\u00b0\n\nThe Masoretic version is thus interpreted this way: In his accusation of Israel, Amos con-\ndemns the people to carry these idols, Sikut and Chiun, with them into the coming Babylon-\nian exile as punishment for having worshipped them in his day.\n\nWe will not here enter into a discussion concerning which version is to be preferred.3! To\nus, whether Chiun was worshipped by the Israelites during the time of Moses or the days of\nAmos does not change the fact that the Israelites did worship this god. Nor does it change the\nfact that this deity was no other than the Saturn of other nations.\n\nThere will now be those who will want to tell me that it is no secret that the Israelites of-\nten fell prone to worshipping false idols and that the case in question reflects no more than\nthat. And, in truth, this is the way in which the verse has been understood by adherents of\nboth the Gentile and Hebrew versions. The association of Shabtai/Saturn with the Hebrew\nSabbath, however, as well as the additional data we will be presenting in the following pages,\nincluding, incidentally, the very name of Israel, speaks against this.\n\nMoreover, hidden within the expression of the Masoretic version of Amos is a datum that\nwill actually strengthen our case. Here I can safely state that even were sikut (that is\n\u201ctents/tabernacles\u201d) made to read Siccuth (in reference to the Assyrian Sakkuth), it would in\nno way invalidate our thesis. Not only would the Saturnian connection of this verse remain\nthrough the undisputed inclusion of Chiun/Kewan, but, ironically, the Assyrian god Sakkuth\nis himself associated in Akkadian texts with the planet Saturn.32\n\nNow it so happens that, just as Shabtai/Saturn translates as \u201cthe resting Planet,\u201d so is\nChiun/Saturn related to a similar characteristic. The word chun, from which the name is de-\nrived,?3 carries the meanings of \u201cestablish,\u201d \u201cfix and/or fixed,\u201d \u201cfirm,\u201d and \u201cstable.\u201d34 Very\nmuch like Shabtai, Chiun can therefore be translated as \u201cthe fixed, firm, or stable planet Sat-\nurn.\u201d In other words, the reference is to a planet at rest. What could this mean?\n\nTHE STABLE ONE\n\nThe old west Semitic deity named Hammu has long been considered to be a sun god.35\nThis is the deity for whom the famous Hammurabi, the first king of the Amorite Dynasty of\nBabylon, was named (or named himself).36 Hammu\u2019s identity as the Sun has been seen to be\nstrengthened by the name of Hammurabi\u2019s fourth successor, Ammizaduga, which name\ntranslates as \u201cAmmi |that is Hammu] is Justice.\u201d This, as Julius Lewy pointed out, accords\nwell with the Assyro-Babylonian Shamash who, in Akkadian hymns, is invoked as kittum,\nthat is \u201cjustice.\u201d37 As we have seen, however, Shamash had originally been a name reserved\nfor the planet Saturn. Should we not then see in Hammu a name for the same planet? Thus,\nfor instance, Hammurabi, named after Saturn, would not have been guilty of apostasy when",

Likewise, when Hammurabi had the\nlaws for which he became famous inscribed on a stela, he had himself depicted as receiving\nthem from Shamash. One cannot, therefore, rightly blame mythologists for identifying\nHammu as a sun-god since, in effect, he was the personification of just that\u2014a sun; the pri-\nmeval Saturnian sun to be sure, but a sun nonetheless.\nThe association with justice, however, is not the only datum on which we can base the\nidentification of Hammu as a personification of the planet Saturn? As Lewy noted, Hammu\nis equivalent to \u201cAman which was a name for the planet Saturn.\u201d How is this identity\nderived? \u2019AmAn, as well as other related names, belong to a linguistic root which means\n\u201cstable\u201d and/or \u201cthe stable one.\u201d And, as Lewy pointed out, \u201cthe stable one\u201d is the meaning\nof the Akkadian name of Saturn, that is Kaimanu, the same as the Arabic Kaiw4n and the\nSyriac K\u00e9w4n,*! the Chiun of the Book of Amos.\nMorris Jastrow tells us that the reason Saturn was called \u201cstable\u201d and/or \u201cregular\u201d and/or\n\u201csteady\u201d was \u201cbecause of the slow and regular motion which is [the planet\u2019s] distinguishing\nfeature.\u201d 42 To be sure, this is the usual explanation that is still given to account for the close-\nto-universal ancient belief we are here considering. But while \u201cstable,\u201d \u201cregular,\u201d and\n\u201csteady,\u201d may account for the slowness of the planet as seen with the naked eye from Earth,\nits slowness cannot be made to account for its additional characteristics of being \u201cfixed\u201d or\n\u201cfirm,\u201d to say nothing of it being described as being \u201cat rest.\u201d Slow the planet may seem to\nmove, but it moves. What the ancients seem to be telling us here is that, in a time long gone\nby, the planet Saturn did not appear to move. Can this be validated?\nTHE GOD OF JERUSALEM\nThe claim that the famed Ebla tablets have shown that Salem and Jerusalem were two dif-\nferent places\u00ae has not been validated. We must therefore continue to accept the statement of\nFlavius Josephus who claimed that Salem had been an earlier name for Jerusalem.\u201c4 Salem,\nFlavius Josephus who claimed that Salem had been an earlier name for Jerusalem.\u201c Salem,\nor shalem, once thought to signify \u201cpeace,\u201d is now known to have been the name of an early\nCanaanite deity.45 Up until recently, this deity had been identified as Venus\u201c but, as we shall\nsee, this identity does not hold.\nIn Chaldean, Jerusalem was rendered Yerushalem; in Hebrew, it changed to Yerushalaim.\nBoth names mean \u201cfounded by Shalem.\u201d Moreover, in a letter sent to an Egyptian king of the\nEighteenth Dynasty, Jerusalem is mentioned both by that name and as Bit Sulmani.47 As\nJulius Lewy concluded, this letter \u201cleaves no doubt that the city was then known not only as",

Easily coming to mind are such cities as Beth-\naven, Beth-El, Bethlehem, Beth-haran, Bethshemesh, Beth-horon, Beth-eden (in Syria),\nBeth-peor, Beth-shan, and many others. Lewy himself explains such place names as due to\nthe one-time existence of sanctuaries each of which was dedicated to the deity there named.*9\nThus, Jerusalem would have been referred to as Beth Shulman because a temple of Shulman\nwould have existed there.\n\nLewy\u2019s conclusion was that a temple of Shulman supplanted an earlier one dedicated to\nShalim but that it did not last for long. During the same period, the name of the city changed\nfrom Urusalim to Bet Shulman; but, with the destruction of the Shulman temple, the name of\nthe city reverted back to Urusalim. This would explain why the name Bet Shulman never be-\ncame popular.\u00b0\u00b0\n\nNeedless to say, this was all conjecture on Lewy\u2019s part. For one thing, Lewy himself ac-\ncepted that Shalim and Shulman(u) were slightly different versions of the same deity,>! so\nthat no replacement of sanctuaries need enter the picture. Nor need the name Bet Shulman\nhave ever supplanted that of Urusalim since, in effect, the meaning of both names is theolog-\nically, even if not philologically, synonymous\u2014the former meaning \u201cHouse of Shulman,\u201d\nthe latter, as we have seen, \u201cFounded by Shalim.\u201d>? It is thus more than possible that Bet\nShulman was merely another designation for Urusalim, the one derived from Assyrian,\nthe other from Chaldean sources. The Chaldean name passed into Hebrew; the Assyrian did\nnot. The one became popular; the other not.\n\nIn any case, whether called by the very name of the god (Salem); referred to as having\nbeen founded by him (Urusalim/Yerushalem); or simply called his city (Bet Shulman); it re-\nmains obvious that the city we call Jerusalem was named in honor and dedicated to the god\nShalem/Shulman.3\n\nIndications that this god was worshipped there can be traced at least to the time of Israel\u2019s\n\nUnited Monarchy.* Also rendered Shulman or Shulmanu,\u00b0> this god\u2019s name gave Jedidiah,\nson of David and king of Israel, his more popular name of Solomon.* Rendered Shlomoh in\nHebrew, this monarch\u2019s name has also been stated to have been derived from shalom, which,\nas everyone knows, does, inter alia, mean \u201cpeace.\u201d (Compare also the Arabic salam and\nMaltese sliema.) The probability, however, is that both the monarch\u2019s name and the word for\n\u201cpeace\u201d derived from the name of the god. As Roy Rosenberg tells us, Stomoh (Shlomoh)\nmeans \u201cbelonging to Salim\u201d57\n\nBiblical theophoric names derived from Shalem are common including the names of\nkings of Israel and Judah. Among such names we find: Shallum, Shelemiah, Shelomi, Shel-\nemi (or Shulamit), after whom Immanuel Velikovsky named one of his daughters, and\n\nelemoth.",

Perhaps less known is the fact that Salummati was an epithet of the great Assur-\nnasirpal.5?\nAs a god, Shulman was worshipped in Nineveh and, under the variant Shulmanuha or\nShulmanuhi, is found mentioned in Assyrian tablets.\u00a9\nShulman is known to have had a feimine counterpart named ShulmanituS!\u2014but also\nShala.\u00ae This goddess\u2014but not Shulman \u2014has been identified with Astarte and Ishtar, both\npersonifications of the planet Venus. Moreover, Assyrian sources define Sulmanitu (the same\nas Shulmanitu) as distar Urusilimma which Michael Astour has rendered \u201cIStar of Jerusa-\nlem.\u201d That this goddess was known in Jerusalem is verified by her laudation in the famous\nSong of Solomon in which she is referred to merely as the Shulammite.\u00ae5\nThe sacrifices performed in Solomon\u2019s temple were referred to in Hebrew as she-\nlamim\u2014the plural of shelem.

In two of these letters which Egyptologists\nhave numbered 74 and 290, reference is made to a place which transliterators have rendered\ndifferently. In 1915, J. Knudtzon settled on the reading of this place as Bet Ninib\u201d\u2014i.e.,\nHouse of Ninib.\nSome time later, in 1940, Julius Lewy re-read the name of this place as Bit Shul-\nmanu\u2014House (or Sanctuary) of Shulman.\u201d\nWilliam Albright did not accept Lewy\u2019s transliteration, claiming that the ideogram which\nhe read as \u201cShulmanu\u201d did not incorporate the determinative for divinity.\u201d\nIn 1969, the team of Tadmor and Kalai re-read the ideogram again, this time as Beth Nin-\nurta.\nWhich, then, was the correct reading?\nThis problem has given birth to many a debate,\u201d but it should never have done so. Let me\nsay that Knudtzon was perfectly correct in reading the name as Bet Ninib since the cuneiform\nideogram which \u201cspells\u201d the name of the god in question is \u201cNIN.IB. Of that, there never was\nany doubt.\" As pointed out in an earlier chapter of this work, Ninib, sometimes rendered\nNinip and/or Nirig, was the planetary god Saturn.\u201d\nThe reason behind Lewy\u2019s re-reading of the name as Shulman may not appear clear to the\nuninitiated. Suffice it to say that cuneiform characters can be read ideographically and/or\nphonetically. Thus the ideogram \u201cNIN.IB can also be read \u201cNinurta\u00ae\u2014which means that",

As we\nhave already documented, Ninurta was also one of the names by which the planet Saturn was\nknown.\n\nLewy\u2019s re-reading, meanwhile, was based on an equation which is to be found in an\nAssyrian explanatory list of divine names. In this list, the Assyrians themselves equated\n\u00a2NIN.IB with \u201cDI.MES. Just as \u2018NIN.IB can be read as \u2018Ninurta, so also can \u201cDI.MES be\nread as \u201cShulmanu.\u00ae It therefore follows that, like Ninib/Ninurta, with whom he was\nequated, Shulman was simply an alias of the planetary god Saturn.\n\nFrom this it can be seen that all three readings\u2014Bet Ninib, Beth Ninurta, and Bit Shul-\nmanu\u2014are correct. They all mean the same thing: \u201cHouse (or Sanctuary) of Saturn.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Albright was entirely wrong when he claimed that the name Shulman\ndid not incorporate the determinative for divinity. The name Shulman, as it appears in el-\nAmarna letter 290, does incorporate the determinative \u2014dingir\u2014for divinity. Lewy repro-\nduced it by the usual transliteration\u2014 viz., \u201cSulmani.\u201d\u2122\n\nThe equation of Shulman with Ninurta/Saturn, as revealed in the above, is of additional\nimportance to the subject of this chapter because, very much like Shulman/Shalem, Ninurta\nwas also considered an immobile god. Thus, in Akkadian, Ninurta was styled kaimanu, that\nis \u201cthe steady star.\u201d\u201d\n\n(For those in the know: The association of Shulman with Resheph, like that of Ninurta\nwith Nergal, will be discussed in a future work.)\n\nTHE MESOPOTAMIAN EVIDENCE\n\nWhile we have already seen that one of the Assyro-Babylonian names for the planet Sat-\nurn was (Mul) Lu-Bat Sag-US, we have so far refrained from saying what the name stood\nfor. Simply put, Lu-Bat Sag-U\u00a7 means \u201cthe steady planet.\u201d The term \u201csteady planet\u201d is not\nmuch different than the term \u201cstable planet,\u201d so that we can see that this characteristic of the\nSaturnian deity was by no means a rarity.\n\nIn keeping with this topic, we also find that Shamash/Saturn was said to have occupied\n\u201cthe house of rest.\u201d\u00ae Here there is no intimation of slow movement. A deity who occupies a\nhouse of rest must himself be at rest.\n\nWhen speaking of the Sumerian god Ea, Berossus, writing in Greek, used the name Kro-\nnos\u201d who was Saturn. And did we not, in Chapter 6, see Ea identified precisely as that very\nsame planet?\n\nThe Babylonian name of Ea was Enki.\u201d In fact, Ea was actually written with the ideo-\ngram EN.KI. Our interest here lies in the fact that Enki, who must, therefore, also be equated\nwith Saturn, was known as \u201cthe motionless lord\u201d and god of \u201cstability.\u201d\u201d As the god of sta-\nbility, Enki compares favorably with Saturn\u2019s epithet as the Stable One.

What is being described here is an immobile god, a planet bereft of motion.\nTHE EGYPTIAN EXPLICITNESS\nWhen we come to Egypt, there is no longer any ambiguity concerning the Saturnian char-\nacteristic we have been investigating. In a hymn to Ra, the deity is addressed with these\nwords: \u201cO thou firstborn, who dost lie without movement...\u201d Here, once again, it remains\nfor Egyptologists to explain why, if Ra was truly the Sun, it was described as lying \u201cwithout\nmovement.\u201d Ra, it was said, \u201crests on his high place.\u201d\u2122\nAtum was also said to have been immobile. Called \u201cthe Firm Heart of the Sky,\u201d it was\ndistinctly said of him that \u201cthe Great God lives fixed in the middle of the sky.\u201d\nIn the Papyrus of Ani, the deceased is addressed with these words: \u201cO thou who art with-\nout motion like unto Osiris!\u201d\u2014and this phrase is twice repeated.\u201d The immobility of Osiris\nis also mentioned in the Text of Teta: \u201cThou art stable in thy name of \u2018Menu\u2019,\u201d it is there\nstated, where \u201cMenu\u201d itself has the meaning of \u201cStable One,\u201d\u201d the very same epithet we\nhave found attached to other Saturnian deities.\nThe Egyptian god Ptah, whom we have also seen being identified as a personification of\nSaturn, was also syncretized with Tenen or Tatanen, a primeval deity who was also lauded as\nthe Disk of Heaven,\u00ae a definite identification of the god as a celestial body. Here, Wallis\nBudge informs us that the \u201cexact attributes\u201d of this deity \u201cappear to have been unknown even\nto the Egyptians.\u201d\u201d And yet, he had no difficulty in deriving the god\u2019s name from the word\nenen, or nen, which means \u201cinertness, inactivity, rest, motionless,\u201d and the like\u201d Despite\nBudge, what this really tells us is that Tenen was considered to be without motion. If this god\ncan truly be equated with Saturn, as his assimilation with Ptah forces us to conclude, it would\nagain register the planet in question as having been immobile.\nSHINING IN THE LIGHTLAND\nThose familiar with Egyptian mythology, especially Egyptologists, can\u2014actually\nshould\u2014raise one telling objection against all of the above. And the objection is this: that,\ndespite his being lauded as lying without movement and as resting on his high place, there\nare various tracts which describe Ra as rising and setting. For instance, in a hymn to Ra, the\ngod is lauded with the words:\n\u201cHomage to thee, O thou who art Ra when thou risesth and Temu [that is Atum]\nwhen thou settest. Thou risest, thou risest, thou shinest, thou shinest, thou who are\ncrowned king of the gods. ..the company of the gods rejoice when thou risest...\u201d!",

Homage to\nthee...when thou risest on the horizon and sheddest thy beams of light...Homage to\nthee, O thou who risest in the horizon as Ra...\u201d!\u201d\n\nHow, then, can we reconcile the above passages, and many more like them, with the idea\nof a motionless Ra?\n\nWell, in the first place, the word translated as \u201chorizon\u201d \u20143ht\u2014actually means \u201clight-\nland,\u201d'\u00ae and while this term continues to be accepted as meaning \u201chorizon,\u201d it should never\nhave been.\n\nIn the second place, the word translated as \u201crises\u201d actually means \u201cshines,\u201d as Patricia\nSpencer indicated.\" There are various Egyptian words which carry these ambiguous mean-\nings. Nen, for instance, means \u201cto rise,\u201d often used in relation to a celestial body, but it also\nmeans \u201cto shine.\u201d'\u00ae More than that, as we have just seen, nen also carries the meanings \u201cin-\nertness, inactivity, rest,\u201d and \u201cmotionless.\u201d Khaut signifies the \u201crising of a god,\u201d but also\n\u201cappearance, splendor, radiance, or brilliance of a god.\u201d\"\u00ae Skhai means \u201cto make to rise up,\u201d\nbut also \u201cto appear.\u201d \u201d When it comes to the rising of the very Ra in question, one word that\nis often used is kha or khai, meaning \u201cto rise\u201d or \u201cto ascend,\u201d but also \u201cto shine\u201d or \u201cto ap-\npear.\u201d 1B So, similarly, with such words as pert (to come forth),'\u00b0uben (to grow bright), and\nun.\n\nAs for \u201csetting,\u201d there is an Egyptian word\u2014urt\u2014which has been rendered as meaning\njust that, but it is only used for \u201cthe setting of a star.\u201d\"' On the other hand, a related\nword\u2014urt-t\u2014actually means \u201cimmobility,\u201d while Urt refers to \u201ca motionless god.\u201d'?\n\nEgyptologists who have translated such phrases as \u201cO thou who risest in the horizon as\nRa\u201d did so because the words \u201cO thou who shines in the lightland\u201d made little sense. On the\nother hand, and in face of the fact that Ra is often described as having been motionless, trans-\nlators should have kept these additional meanings in mind. A motionless god, or celestial\nbody, that rises and sets is an impossibility. A god, or celestial body, that shines without\nmovement is not. Thus, As David Talbott indicated, the god does not rise or set but comes\nforth and recedes, that is he grows bright, he shines, and he dims.'\u201d\n\nREIGNING EM HETEP\n\nWe have already seen it said of Atum that he \u201clives fixed in the middle of the sky.\u201d\n\nInter alia, the god was also said to have reigned in peace. \u201cHomage to thee, O thou who\nart in peace,\u201d is a phrase twice repeated in the Papyrus of Mut-hetep. \u201cCome, come in\npeace!\u201d he is implored, \u201cthou wakest in peace...\u201d!*",

We have\nalso seen that the name of this god translates as \u201cthe Stable One.\u201d But what, then, is the con-\nnection between peace and stability?\n\nThe Hebrew shalom derives from shalam, which means \u201cto be safe.\u201d \"> So, also, with the\nMaltese sliema which also means \u201csafety.\u201d\"\u00b0 \u201cPeace\u201d and \u201csafety\u201d are allied terms but, in a\nsense, is not also \u201cstability\u201d?\n\nNow, as it happens, the Egyptian word sharm\u2019 means \u201cto be peaceful,\u201d but also \u201cto be\nidle\u201d\"\u201d\u2014that is \u201cto be doing nothing,\u201d which negates motion. Another Egyptian word\nmeaning \u201cto be at peace\u201d is heri, but heri also means \u201cto rest.\u201d\"\u00ae The Egyptian word most\ncommonly used for \u201cto be at peace,\u201d however, is hetep which also means \u201cto repose,\u201d \u201cto\nrest,\u201d and \u201cto be at rest.\u201d\"\n\nThis, then, raises the question: Given that Atum was described as being fixed in the mid-\ndle of the sky, what is the logical characteristic to be allotted him when he is stated to have\nbeen em hetep \u2014to have been at peace, or to have been at rest?\n\nThis, incidentally, brings us back to the god Imhotep\u2014the same as Em Hetep\u2014and\nmakes us ask the question: Was Imhotep really the deified architect who built Djoser\u2019s pyra-\nmid, as generally believed? Or was he yet another manifestation of the immobile god we\nhave learned to recognize as Saturn? Talbott, who embraced the meaning of this god\u2019s name\nas \u201cthe one who comes forth while standing in one place,\u201d \u2122 seems to have had no doubt.\n\nIMMOVABLY FIXED\n\nThe Egyptian Ra is not the only supposed sun-god said to have been devoid of mo-\ntion. In chapter 3 we saw the Indic Surya called Suraj, which latter name belongs to the\nplanet Saturn. We also noted there that Surya is said to have occupied samanam dhama, \u201cthe\nsame place of rising and setting.\u201d We did not there explain the meaning behind this term,\nhaving used it only to denote that Surya could not possibly have been the present Sun. What\nis easier to believe, that a celestial body can climb vertically up the sky and vertically down\non the same path, or that it brightens and fades while remaining in the same spot? In view of\nwhat we have now disclosed, does not the latter seem preferable? In fact, we can state it un-\nequivocally, since it is unambiguously written that Surya \u201cstands firmly,\u201d and he does so on a\n\u201csafe resting place.\u201d The belief in Surya\u2019s immobility was so ingrained that he continued to\nbe remembered as \u201cthe immovable center of his system.\u201d \u201d So how can Indologists continue\nto perpetrate the disinformation that Surya is the Sun?\n\nEven Brahma, we are told, does not rise and set. He \u201cremains alone in the center.\u201d'\u201d And\nif there are those who think that this immobility may have applied to planetary deities, but\nnot necessarily to the planets they once personified, they are mistaken. Sthirah, for instance,\nis yet one more Sanskrit name for the planet Saturn.'\u201d No deity is involved here. And yet we",

It is a pure astronomical\nassertion deduced from the very meaning of the planet\u2019s name.\nTHE NEVER-SETTING PLANET\nLynn Rose deduced that the bizarre astronomical system of Philolaos, the Pythagorean\nphilosopher from Souther Italy, was merely a \u201cgarbled\u201d version of the primeval Saturnian\nsystem. This, needless to say, led him to the conclusion that the Central Fire of which\nPhilolaos spoke was really an allusion to the old Saturnian sun. As Rose then tells us:\n\u201cHistorians of philosophy are fond of referring to the \u2018dark sayings\u2019 of Heraclitus. If\nHeraclitus was at times reflecting back to conditions during the Age of Kronos, per-\nhaps we are now in a position to understand some of his mysterious remarks. The\nCentral Fire is always at the same location in the sky (as viewed from one spot); this\nmay be why Heraclitus asks, \u2018How can anyone hide from that which never sets?\u201d\u201d!\u201d\nAs Rose continues:\n\u201cEven some of the Philolaos fragments, although their authenticity has been ques-\ntioned, make more sense now We are also told that \u2018it [the Central Fire] is ruler and\nteacher of all things; it is God, One ever-existing, stable, unmoving, itself like to it-\nself, different from the rest,\u2019 and that it \u2018remains One for ever in the same position\nand condition\u2019.\u201d\"\nand condition\u2019.\u201d'*\nGreek knowledge of the immobile Saturnian sun, however, was not restricted to the\n\u201cgarbled\u201d version of Philolaos. In his evaluation of the Greek Helios and other so-called an-\ncient sun-gods, E. A. Butterworth also came to the conclusion that this luminary \u201cis not the\nnatural sun of heaven, for it neither rises nor sets, but is, as it seems, ever at the zenith...\u201d'\u201d\nSo similarly from other parts of the world. For example, in Roman tradition, among the\npoets, Saturn was remembered as the god of \u201cthe steadfast star.\u201d 30\nThe Incas, too, preserved a memory of a sun-god\u2014a resting one, to be sure\u2014who was\nable \u201cto light the world from one spot.\u201d'' We can therefore be assured that when the\nMakiritare of the Upper Orinoco River, in Venezuela, tell us that their god Wanadi was \u201clike\na sun that never sets,\u201d'\u201d they are referring to an old tradition about the planet Saturn. That\nWanadi was not the present Sun is additionally indicated by the fact that the Makiritare name\nfor the Sun is Shi.",

        "content": "\nChapter 10\nThe Polar Station\nA CHOICE OF MODELS\niven that Earth was a satellite of Saturn, one way in which the giant planet could have\nappeared immobile in Earth\u2019s primeval sky is if Earth had been in phase-lock with its\nprimary. This is precisely the case with our Moon which is in phase-lock with Earth.\nWhat this means is that the Moon rotates on its axis in the same time it takes it to revolve\naround Earth. Thus, as seen from Earth, the Moon always presents the same face to us. The\nother side of the Moon, usually called the far side, is not visible from Earth. (It was revealed\nto Earth-bound eyes for the first time through the photographic capabilities of twentieth\ncentury space-probes.) What this also means is that, as seen from the lunar hemisphere facing\nEarth, as those astronauts who landed on the Moon could see for themselves, our world\nappears motionless, that is fixed in one spot, pasted on the darkness of the lunar sky. Whether\nEarth appears stationary at the zenith of the lunar sky, half way down the sky, or permanently\nfixed on the horizon, or even half hidden by the horizon, would depend on the lunar locality\nfrom which it is viewed. There is, of course, no need to point out that, from the far side of the\nMoon, Earth is simply not visible.\nAs Alan Stern and Jacqueline Milton pointed out, a similar situation, but somewhat in\nreverse, holds for the planet Pluto and its satellite Charon. Since Charon\u2019s orbital period is\nthe same as Pluto\u2019s rotational period, to a Plutonian, Charon would appear to be similarly\nfixed in the sky.! (Patrick Moore misspoke when he called this \u201ca situation unique in the\nSolar System,\u201d? since he seems to have forgotten the case of the Moon when he penned these\nwords.)\nThere is another way in which Saturn could have appeared immobile in Earth\u2019s sky. This\ncould have come about if Earth had been suspended directly \u201cbeneath\u201d or \u201cabove\u201d one of\nSaturn\u2019s poles, with both planets sharing the same axis of rotation. In that case, Saturn would\nhave appeared fixed in Earth\u2019s north or south celestial sphere. This, however, is not only an\nunheard-of situation which is nowhere duplicated in our present Solar System, it is also one\nwhich defies presently accepted celestial mechanics. All it inspires is disbelief.\nIt is, therefore, understandable that, in his Saturnian scenario, as extracted from the\n\u201cgarbled\u201d system of Philolaos, Lynn Rose opted for an Earth in phase lock with Saturn.3 And\nyet for years I had reason to object to Rose\u2019s explanation of this phenomenon,+ just as he\nfound reason to object to mine\u00ae>\u2014since, almost from the very start of my research, I had\ncome to the conclusion that Saturn\u2019s proper placement in Earth\u2019s primordial sky had to have\nG= that Earth was a satellite of Saturn, one way in which the giant planet could have",

The answer is simple enough: That\nis where the mytho-historical record places the primeval Saturn\u2014plumb in the centre of\nEarth\u2019s north celestial sphere, the very place which is presently occupied by the Pole Star.\n\nThat this is an outlandish theory there is no doubt. Despite the fruit of my research, even I\nended up disbelieving the entire thing, and I must honestly admit that it was not until I had\nread Hamlet\u2019s Mill that I finally accepted all that my research had unearthed. If, as I reasoned\nat the time, scholars of the caliber of Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend, the au-\nthors of Hamlet\u2019s Mill, had been able to unearth the same set of bizarre situations in connec-\ntion with Saturn\u2019s polar station, I could not be that far off the mark myself. If the authors in\nquestion could discuss the ancient belief in a Saturn that was permanently fixed in Earth\u2019s\nnorth celestial sphere, then so could I. That de Santillana and von Dechend chose not to ac-\ncept what they themselves had discovered was their business.\u201d But the lameness with which\nthey ended up explaining away what they had brought to light made me all the more ready to\naccept it all.\n\nNow it has to be said that both Rose\u2019s model and mine (as well as David Talbott\u2019s) are\nbased on the mytho-historical record. Let us then examine what the mytho-historical record\nhas to say about the subject.\n\nEL\u2014ELOAH\u2014ELOHIM\n\nBecause we shall be delving more into the Old Testament as we go along, a few words\nconcerning this collection of Hebrew books are in order.\n\nThe oldest complete version of the Old Testament is the Greek Septuagint (2nd century\nB.C.). The Hebrew text from which it was translated is no longer extant in any complete\nform. The oldest Hebrew version that we now possess in entirety is the Massoretic Text (6th\nto 8th century A. D. ) Not only is there something like eight hundred years separating the\ntwo, there are also major differences between them.\n\nWhile the Septuagint is not always to be preferred, it is superior to the Massoretic Text\nwhich, beyond dispute, contains more numerous corruptions. To be sure, the Massoretic Text\nhas remained unchanged since its \u201cfixing\u201d in the 6th century A.D., but that a great number of\nchanges had been introduced before that date is also well known.\u00ae Textual comparison has\nlong made it obvious that the Septuagint, compiled by the Jewish scholars of Jerusalem at the\nbehest of Demetrius Phalereus and Aristeas for Ptolemy Philadelphus and the Jews of\nAlexandria,? was translated from a Hebrew text that was purer than the much later Mas-\nsoretic version.\n\nThe issue, of course, is more complex than that, but the above should suffice to\nremind the reader that, when it comes to interpretation, not all versions of the Old Testament\nare of equal value. In what follows, and throughout this work, we shall therefore be\ncomparing various versions in an attempt to ferret out what the original beliefs might have\nbeen. In matters where even comparison will leave us stranded at an impasse, however, it is\nto the Septuagint that we shall bow our heads, simply because, where no other arbiter is\navailable, it is the oldest version that should receive the benefit of the doubt.",

        "content": "\nWhat I wish to stress at this point, more than anything else, is that the Old Testament\nspeaks of various deities which, in English and other translations, were changed to read\n\u201cGod,\u201d \u201cLord,\u201d \u201cLord God,\u201d \u201cMost High God,\u201d etc. Leaving all sectarian biases aside, we\nshall therefore re-insert the correct Hebrew names of these deities in the quotes we shall be\nciting throughout the rest of this work. As we progress, we shall also see whether these vari-\nous names were merely cognomens of one and the same deity. The first three such names\nwhich will concern us in this study are El, Eloah, and Elohim.\nNow it has sometimes been stated that \u201cElohim,\u201d which name is mentioned 2570 times in\nthe Old Testament,!\u00b0 is \u201cthe plural of a lost singular.\u201d!! The singular, or synonym, of\n\u201cElohim,\u201d however, is hardly lost; it is merely \u201cEl\u201d and/or \u201cEloah.\u201d!? To William Heidel, the\nElohim were the allies of El!3\u2014whatever these might have been. The name \u201cElohim,\u201d how-\never, was not always used as a plural. A. Murtonen, for instance, tells us: \u201cAs to the primary\nmeaning there cannot be any doubt, the word being formally a plural, but the singular mean-\ning is also very old, as the Ras Shamra [i.e., Ugaritic] texts prove.\u201d!4 Murtonen goes out of\nhis way in attempting to explain this plurality,!> but, in the end, it seems to boil down to an\nold usage equivalent to the more modern royal \u201cwe.\u201d As David Rohl succinctly phrased it:\n\u201cBiblical Hebrew occasionally employs something scholars call the \u2018majestic plural.\u201d\nIn effect it is a plural ending added to a deity\u2019s name to confer status or majesty. In\nthe Old Testament the best example is Elohim which does not mean \u2018the gods\u2019 but is\nrather the god El with the majestic plural im appended.\u201d!6\nEloah, on the other hand, only appears 57 times in the Old Testament, \u201cand almost en-\ntirely in poetry\u201d! such as the Book of Job. That Eloah was the equivalent of El,!8 mean-\nwhile, is brought out in the same Book of Job where the two names are used interchange-\nably.!9 According to Murtonen, this variant of the name is merely the vocative of\n\u201cEl\u201d20\u2014that is the form used in invocation.\nWhich leaves us with the shortened form \u201cEl\u201d which, apart from its inclusion in\ntheophoric names, appears 230 times in the Old Testament.?! That El was the god of Israel\npar excellence is borne out by the fact that when Jacob arrived in the city of Shechem, in the\nland of Canaan, following his twenty-year sojourn working for Laban, he set up an altar and\ncalled it El-elohe-yisrael, which means \u201cEl, God of Israel.\u201d 2?\nMore than that, however, is the very name Israel itself. Although, as Hans Goedicke\nnoted, all efforts to explain the name have been unsuccessful, it is definitely a theophoric one",

The name \u201cIsrael\u201d appears\nfirst in the Book of Genesis where the Patriarch Jacob is described as having wrestled with a\nmysterious stranger, at the end of which the stranger told Jacob: \u201cThy name shall be called\nno more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with Elohim and with men, and\nhast prevailed.\u201d25 The name Israel was, therefore, bestowed on Jacob because he \u201cprevailed\u201d\nlike a prince over the stranger with the power of Elohim. And, as it has been assumed by\nothers before me, the name \u201cIsrael\u201d is composed of the word sarah\u2014\u201cto prevail\u201d \u2014and \u201cEl.\u201d\nThus it might not be amiss to say that \u201cIsrael\u201d most likely means \u201cto prevail like El\u201d or \u201clet\nEl prevail.\u201d\nAs Ronald Hendel argued, El was the oldest god of the Israelites. This is evidenced by\nthe fact that, in the Old Testament, up until the time of the Exodus, theophoric names incor-\nporate only the name of El (as, for example, Israel, Ishmael, and Bethuel).2\u00b0 This coincides\nwith what is known of Canaanite religion in the pre-Israelite period. \u201cThe evidence, from\nUgarit in the north to Sinai in the south, testifies that during [the pre-Israelite period] the high\ngod of various local Canaanite pantheons was named El.\u201d27 Murtonen goes even further\nwhen he states that the name can be traced to primitive times. \u201cThat \u2019el is a very primitive\nword is proved by 1) its existence in all the Semitic languages with the (possible) exception\nof Ethiopic...2) the fact that it was composed of only two radicals...and 3) that these radicals\nare numbered among the most primitive ones.\u201d*8 As for the origin of El, the same authority\ninforms us:\n\u201cEl itself can have been derived only from a concrete conception, i.e., from immedi-\nate experience. In other words, the question is philologically unsolvable.\u201d29\nate experience. In other words, the question is philologically unsolvable.\u201d2\u00b0\nPhilologically unsolvable\u2014perhaps; but not necessarily cosmogonically so, as we shall\nsoon see. We start by asking the question: What could this \u201cconcrete conception,\u201d this\n\u201cimmediate experience,\u201d of which Murtonen speaks, have been? Having already touched\nupon the subject on an earlier page, the identity of El should not surprise the reader. Even so,\nfor starters we mention here the fact that, in Akkadian inscriptions, the phonetic writing for\nEI (or Il) is sometimes used for the logogram otherwise read as An.?\u00b0 In god lists found at\nMari, the two names are interchangeable. As Alfred Eaton disclosed: \u201cIt is known that the\nname El was written with the sign AN (Ik-ru-ub-AN and Ik-ru-ub-Il)...\u201d3! In discussing the\nsame material, Herman Wohlstein argues simply for an identification of El/An as a tutelary\ndeity ,32 an equation that could only have been reached because of the widespread acceptance\nof El, by Jews and Christians alike, as a name simply meaning \u201cGod.\u201d But that \u201cEl\u201d was",

As Frank Moore Cross indicated, El was the\nchief deity of the Mesopotamian Semites, as he was also that of the pre-Islamic Arabs\nbesides the Canaanites.35 In fact it has long been known that the pre-Islamic Allah traces to\nthe same root as El or Eloah.3\u00a2 Cross also cites evidence which equates El with the Egyptian\nPtah (yet another deity we have already seen identified as Saturn) as also with Ba\u2019al (of\nwhom we shall have more to say elsewhere).\nWilliam Albright equated El with the Assyro-Babylonian Shamash?\u2019 which, once again,\nwe have already shown to be an alternate name for the planet Saturn.\nWilliam Heidel goes straight to the heart of the matter when he tells us that \u201cCronos [or\nKronos\u2014the Greek name for the planet Saturn] is called El by the Phoenicians.\u201d3\u00ae This\nidentification traces to the Phoenician scholar Sanchoniathon himself, as quoted by Philo of\nByblos, who identified the Canaanite El with the Greek Kronos? As Cross submitted:\n\u201cPhilo Byblius, and other classical sources, and inscriptions in Greek and Latin all establish\nthe formula that B\u2019! Hmn [i.e., Ba\u2019al Hamon] on the one hand, and El on the other, are Greek\nKronos, Latin Saturnus.\u201d4\u00b0 Moreover, as Cross admits: \u201cThese equations have long been\nknown, and all new data confirm the ancient.\u201d4! Albright, therefore, was on track when he\nidentified El outright with the Latin Saturnus.*?\nWe did not, therefore, misspeak when, on an earlier page, we pointed out that, according\nto the ancients, it was the planet Saturn that was really the god of the Jews. When the Old\nTestament itself, as we have seen, declares El to have been the \u201cGod of Israel,\u201d it is the same\nas saying that Saturn was that god. And, in fact, is this not additionally borne out by the very\nname Israel which, as we have pointed out, incorporates the theophoric name of El who was\nSaturn? Thus, incidentally, when J. Glen Taylor, on Biblical and archaeological evidence,\nwas forced to conclude that it was the \u201csun\u201d that was worshipped in the Jerusalem Temple by\nthe Kings of Judah,3 we can be certain that the \u201csun\u201d in question was the Saturnian one.\nTHE LEFT HAND OF GOD\nIn a Hebrew psalm we read:\n\u201cUnto thee, O Elohim do we give thanks...When I shall receive the congregation I\nwill judge uprightly...Promotion [i.e., exaltation] cometh not from the East, nor from\nthe West, nor from the South.\u201d44",

Does this not, in itself, also mean that Elohim resided in the north? And if Elohim, as\nwe have seen, was identified by the ancients themselves as Saturn, would it not also mean\nthat Saturn\u2019s locus was in the north?\nAs Warren continues: \u201cA curious trace of the same conception appears in the book of\nJob...\u201d47 Here Warren is referring to that specific incident in which Job, while lamenting the\nbitter deal that fate had dealt him, complains that he has looked for Eloah but could not find\nhim:\n\u201cBehold, I look forward [or \u2018in front\u2019], but he is not there; and backward [or\n\u2018behind\u2019], but I cannot perceive him. On the left hand, where he doth work, but I can-\nnot behold him. He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.\u201d 8\nHere, the Hebrew word translated \u201cforward\u201d or \u201cin front\u201d is gedem or gedmah which,\namong other things, means \u201ceastward.\u201d49 As is to be expected, \u2019achor, the Hebrew word\ntranslated as \u201cbackward\u201d or \u201cbehind\u201d also means \u201cwestward.\u201d Semo\u2019l, translated \u201cleft,\u201d\nalso means \u201cnorth.\u201d5! While yamin, that is \u201cright,\u201d also means \u201csouth.\u201d52 Job\u2019s words, above,\nshould therefore read:\n\u201cBehold, I look eastward, but he [i.e., Eloah] is not there; and westward, but I cannot\nperceive him. To the north, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him. He hideth\nhimself in the south, that I cannot see him.\u201d\nThe designations \u201cin front,\u201d \u201cbehind,\u201d \u201cleft hand,\u201d and \u201cright hand,\u201d for \u201ceast,\u201d \u201cwest,\u201d\n\u201cnorth,\u201d and \u201csouth,\u201d came into common use among the Semites much later when the\nSun\u2014that is the present Sun\u2014had replaced the Saturnian one. Because of other factors\nwhich do not here concern us, orientation was indicated by facing east in which the Sun rose.\nThus the east was in front, the west was behind, the north was at one\u2019s left hand, and the\nsouth on one\u2019s right.\nBut here, now, as Warren noted,*3 is the odd thing about the manner in which Job\u2019s\nlament is worded. While lodging his grievance that nowhere\u2014east, west, north, or\nsouth\u2014could he find Eloah, he made a telling distinction concerning the north. The left hand,\nthat is the north, is described as the place \u201cwhere he [that is Eloah] doth work.\u201d So that,\nagain, we find that it was precisely in the north that Eloah, the same as Elohim/El/Saturn,\nwas believed to accomplish his handiwork.\nIt is, therefore, somewhat ironical that the left hand, the place where the god\u2019s goodly\ndeeds were accomplished, became synonymous with bad luck.

When\nElohim was said to have revealed himself to the prophet Ezekiel, as described in the very\nfirst chapters of that book, he is said to have appeared from the north.55\nIt was for this very reason that, when the High Priest of Israel officiated at the altar in\nboth the Tabernacle and, later, in the Jerusalem temple, he was obliged to face north. In\nfact, this priestly ritual of facing north while officiating was practiced by the prelates of other\nancient nations, among them the priests of the Haranite Sabzens.5\u2019 As A. Fornander noted:\n\u201cThe Hawaiian soothsayer, or kilo-kilo, turned always to the North when observing\nthe heavens for signs or omens...The ancient Hindus turned also to the North for di-\nvining purposes, and so did the Iranians before the schism...so did the Greeks, and so\ndid the Scandinavians before their conversion to Christianity.\u201d 58\nThis northernism, meanwhile, must not be understood in a terrestrial sense, but, rather, in\na celestial one. This is brought out by the fact that the circumpolar stars were alluded to as\nKokkabe \u2018El (the \u201cstars of El\u201d).5\u00b0 The throne of El was considered to be \u201cthe pole of the uni-\nverse.\u201d \u00a9 Given all of the above, El (Eloah/Elohim) could only have resided in the north cel-\nestial pole. As Warren observed:\n\u201cThe Pole, the unmoving centre-point of the heavens directly overhead, would natu-\nrally have seemed to be the top of the world, the true heaven, the changeless seat of\nthe supreme, all-ruling God. And if, accordingly, through all the long lifetime of the\nante-diluvian world, the circumpolar sky was to human thought the true abode of\nGod, the oldest post-diluvian peoples, though scattered down the sides of the globe\nhalf or two thirds the distance to the equator, could not easily have forgotten that at\nthe centre and true top of the rotating sky was the throne of its great Creator, and that\nthere, in the far North, was \u2018the sacred quarter\u2019 of the world.\u201d61\nAnd:\n\u201cThe religions of all ancient nations signally confirm and satisfy this antecedent ex-\npectation. With a marvelous unanimity they associate the abode of the supreme God\nwith the North Pole, \u2018the centre of heaven,\u2019 or with the celestial space immediately\nsurrounding it.\u201d62",

Having, however, seen that, according to the ancients themselves, the god of the\nOld Testament was really a personification of the planet Saturn, we will have to assume that,\nas astronomically impossible as it might at first seem, the primeval Saturn was believed to\nhave once been situated in the place now occupied by the Pole Star.\nOne discordant item the reader may have noted concerns the circumpolar stars them-\nselves\u2014for have we not, on a previous page, argued for the solitude of the very same planet-\nary deity, where no other heavenly body was visible. And, to be sure, we will posit here that,\nwhile Saturn shone as a sun, no stars, except perhaps those of first magnitude, could have\nbeen seen in the night sky. So how, then, could the circumpolar stars have been seen, let\nalone proclaimed as being the stars of El/Saturn? These stars, which we shall meet again be-\nlow, could not have been considered the property of El during that time when Saturn ruled\nthe pole. It was only when Saturn resigned his lofty position that the stars came into view for\nthe first time. It was then seen that the circumpolar stars circled around that very area in the\ncenter of which the god of humanity had once resided. For that reason they became sacred to\nthe memory of the god who had, by then, moved elsewhere. But all this will have to be left\nfor a future work.\u201c What is of immediate concern here is whether this Saturnian northernism\nis upheld by the beliefs of ancient nations other than the Semites.\nTHE STARS OF ANU\nIn their astronomical treatises, the Babylonians placed their Prime Meridian through the\nnorth pole. The Prime Meridian is the point from which star locations are measured. As\nNorman Schwarz noted: \u201cFor everyone, ever since the time of the Babylonians, the Zero of\nLongitude was an abstract; for the Babylonians, it was a matter of geography.\u201d\u00ae But then: \u201cIf\nthe Babylonians had been like the Greeks, Spanish, British, etc., they would have put their\nPrime Meridian through Babylon; but they did not!\u201d\u00ae Instead they chose the north pole. But\nhow does this relate to Babylonian geography? The geography of which Schwarz speaks was\nnot terrestrial, but, rather, celestial. As he himself informs us, the North Pole was \u201cthe loca-\ntion where the gods had resided,\u201d that is \u201cin the North.\u201d\u201c\nAs was the case with El, the northern stars were held sacred to Anu.\u00a9 Stephen Langdon\nAs was the case with El, the northern stars were held sacred to Anu.\u00ae Stephen Langdon\ntells us that An, or Anu, was associated with the \u201cnorthern polar stars.\u201d At Erech, sacrifices\nwere offered \u201cto the polar stars of Anu.\u201d The Pole Star itself was even called the \u201cstar of\nAnu.\u201d Thus, a prayer to the Pole Star began with the words \u201cO star of Anu, prince of the\nheavens.\u201d\nWe thus find out that, in Mesopotamia, the gods were believed to reside in the north.\nMore than that, the prime god of the Mesopotamians, An (or Anu) was not only associated\nwith the circumpolar stars, but with the Pole Star itself. That Anu (or An) was a personifica-\ntion of the planet Saturn, we have seen on an earlier page. That the Pole Star was revered as\nthe star of Anu is thus understandable. As we explained in relation to the circumpolar stars\nthemselves, once the planet Saturn was removed from its north polar placement, the Pole Star\nwould have been seen to have taken its place.",

These were located in tra-\nditional ancestral cemeteries at Abydos and Saqgqara. It is of interest that, associated with\nthese tombs were vast rectangular niched enclosures the long sides of which ran north to\nsouth. Royal officials also built their tombs in ancestral cemeteries apart from those of the\nkings. They, too, were oriented north-south.\u201d\nAs Ann Macy Roth pointed out:\n\u201cBoth the orientation and the size of these early burial complexes provide clues to the\nancient Egyptians\u2019 beliefs about immortality. The tombs\u2019 sloped northern entrance\npointed to stars in the northern sky that never sank below the horizon [the circumpo-\nlar stars]\u2014suggesting that immortality could be attained by joining these\n\u2018unwearying\u2019 stars.\u201d\u00ae\nBy the end of the Third, and the beginning of the Fourth, Dynasty, royal burials shifted to\nwithin true smooth-sided pyramids. Roth was of the opinion that the change came about be-\ncause \u201cthe diurnal death and rebirth of the sun supplanted the perpetual northern stars as the\nmost important symbol of the afterlife.\u201d But, other than the recognition that Ra originated\nas a personification of the planet Saturn, rather than the Sun, Roth\u2019s conclusion is altogether\nerroneous because, even in the pyramids she herself mentions, the connection with the cir-\ncumpolar stars continued to be retained.\nIn the Pyramid Texts found inscribed on the walls of the Pyramid of Unas, the circumpo-\nlar stars are indirectly associated with Atum. The text deals with the final location in the sky\nthat Unas is meant to achieve after his death. There it is stated:\n\u201cThe Father of Unas, Atum, seizes the arm of Unas and he assigns Unas to...the Cir-\ncumpolar Stars.\u201d\u201d\n\u201cThou art to purify thyself with the cool water of the Circumpolar Stars.\u201d\u201d\n\u201cThe sun-folk shall call out to you, for the Circumpolar Stars have raised you aloft.\u201d\u201d\nFrom this it becomes obvious that, in order to reach his final resting place in the here-af-\nter, and be together with Atum for evermore, King Unas needed to travel to the region of the\ncircumpolar stars. That Atum is to be identified as the planet Saturn need not be repeated.\nTHE EGYPTIAN CREED OF RESURRECTION\nOn the inner side of a lid to a granite sarcophagus discovered at Kom Abu Yasin are\nrecorded the monthly variations of the polar constellation which is usually represented by a\nbull. In this instance, as in others, the celestial bull is symbolized only by its foreleg.\u201d This\nsymbolism is not merely reserved for pictorial depictions; it is also invoked in verbal incan-\ntations. Thus, for instance, it is written: \u201cHail to thee, O thou Thigh which dwellest in the",

The accompanying text on the Kom Abu Yasin sarcophagus\nlid, however, equates Osiris with this heavenly bull.\u201d That the planet Saturn was known as\nHeru-ka-Pet\u2014that is, Horus Bull of Heaven\u2014is well known.\u201d What is of interest to us here\nis that the inscription on the lid of the sarcophagus in question can be said to place Osiris, as\nthe Bull of Heaven, that is the planet Saturn, in the north polar sphere.\nWe do not, however, have to rely on this inscription, since it is well known that Osiris\nwas considered the god of the north,\u201d even though, unfortunately, Wallis Budge understood\nthis in a terrestrial way.\u201d But that the northern locality of Osiris was celestial is evidenced by\nthe fact that his abode was believed to have been \u201cpermanent in Sekhet-hetepet, among the\nimperishable stars,\u201d to which the deceased hoped to ascend.\u201d The \u201cimperishable stars\u201d are\nnone other than the \u201ccircumpolar stars\u201d which, because they circle around the celestial pole,\nare never seen to dip below the horizon and, therefore, viewed as imperishable by the ancient\nEgyptians. The same text also speaks of the deceased as moving and traveling, but this\nshould be understood in relation to the journey of the deceased from Earth to the abode of\nOsiris. This is so true that when the deceased, in this case Pepi I, finally reaches his destina-\ntion, he \u201cstands up at the north of heaven with him,\u201d\u00ae that is with Osiris.\nSo, likewise, with Ra, as we learn from the same inscriptions inscribed on the walls of the\nPyramid of Pepi I. In his afterlife, the king was believed to achieve his spiritual destiny only\nwhen he was finally united with Ra in the north of heaven. As it is written: \u201cWhen Pepi\nstandeth upon the north of heaven with Ra, he becometh the lord of the universe, like unto\nthe king of the gods.\u201d*\nThat this is so is also evidenced by the fact that Amon-Ra was said to have resided in the\nDivine Land. \u201cBeautiful of Face,\u201d he was lauded, \u201cwho comest from the Divine Land.\u201d\u00ae In\nEgyptian, the Divine Land is rendered as Neter-ta.* Brugsch, however, defined \u201cNeter-ta\u201d\nor, more correctly, \u201cNeter-ta-Mehti,\u201d as \u201cthe northern land of the gods\u201d and this, as Gerald\nMassey pointed out, is not to be confused with \u201can elevated part of our earth,\u201d but is to be\nunderstood as \u201cthe polar paradise in heaven.\u201d\u2122 For that reason, the deceased was lauded with\nthe words: \u201cMay your face be in the north of the sky, may Re summon you from the zenith\n[\u201ctop\u201d or \u201ccrown,\u201d really] of the sky.\u201d\u00ae\nIt can therefore be seen that the Egyptians believed that, once dead, they would be resur-\nrected and made to join their god\u2014Atum, Re, Osiris, all of whom are identifiable as personi-\nfications of the planet Saturn \u2014in the north polar sky.\nTHE GUARDIAN OF THE POLE\nThe Persian Bundahish contains some curious passages which bear directly on the topic\nat hand.

But, in view of what has been disclosed above, this should not surprise us.\n\nNow, as it happens, in the Bhagavata Purana, the celestial north pole is described as the\n\u201chighest region of Vishnu.\u201d Again, in the same work, it is stated that \u201cabove Ursa Major\nlies what they call the highest abode of Vishnu\u201d around whom the stars respectfully go\nround.\u00ae The question, here, becomes this: Is Vishnu, like Brahma, to be identified with Sat-\nurn or with the Pole Star? The question seems to be answered for us in the Kurma Purana\nwhere it is stated that the Lord Vishnu abides in the place of Dhruva, which is the Pole Star.\nIn other words, Vishnu was not identified with the Pole Star; it is merely stated that he abides\nin its place. But is there any evidence that Vishnu personified the planet Saturn?\n\nLittle seems to have been known of Vishnu in the Vedic age, and not much is said about\nhim in the oldest Sanskrit work known to us, the Rig Veda. In later Hinduism, however,\nVishnu comes to the forefront as one of the most important deities together with Shiva and\nIndra. In this later mythology, Vishnu is presented as an oft-reincarnated deity who, to use\nthe very words put into his mouth, comes down to Earth \u201cwhenever order, justice and morals\nare in danger.\u201d* These reincarnations of Vishnu, called avatars\u2014(literally \u201cde-\nscents\u201d\u2122\u00ae)\u2014will not here concern us. We will, instead, focus on the primal godhead himself\nwho, among various other epithets, is known as Svayambhu, he \u201cwho exists of himself.\u201d Of\nmore importance to us, however, is that we have it on the authority of both the Vishnu Pu-\nrana and the Linga Purana that Vishnu is to be equated with Brahma. *\n\nAnother epithet of Vishnu is Prajapati,\u201d whom we have already seen identified as Saturn.\nAccording to the Brahma Purana, one of his manifestations is that of Surya.\u2019 To this day, a\nsculptured depiction of Vishnu as Surya exists in the thirteenth century A.D. Temple of\nSurya at Konarak, Orissa.\u2019\n\nYet one more epithet of the god is Yamakilah, derived from Yama.'\u201d As we pointed out\nin our first chapter, the Linga Purana tells us that \u201cthe great planet Shaniscara, the slow-\nmoving Saturn, is Yama, the lord of the worlds.\u201d'\u00ae And, to be sure, that Yama was a person-\nification of the planet Saturn is well known.'\u2122\n\nIn the same Linga Purana, Vishnu is made to claim: \u201cI am Kala.\u201d'\u00ae Not to be confused\nwith Kali, Kala is also a name of Yama'\u00ae who was Saturn. Actually, the name Kala itself\nwas that of the planet Saturn. Additionally, a name of Vishnu is Kalakunchah,\u2019\u201d derived\nfrom Kala.",

According to this parable, Dhruva was placed at his station by\nVishnu. Moreover, Vishnu impressed on Dhruva that the abode in which he placed him had\nformerly been his. \u201cThis abode,\u201d Vishnu is made to state, \u201cis mine, the greatest, the steady\nsplendid abode.\u201d\nThe same parable, in slightly different guise, is also contained in the Bhagavata Purana,\nwhere Dhruva is described ascending to the highest pole \u201cto the exalted seat of Vishnu, round\nwhich the starry spheres forever wander...\u201d '* We can thus see that it was the belief of the\nHindus that the polar station had been Vishnu\u2019s, that is Saturn\u2019s, before it became Dhruva\u2019s,\nthat is the Pole Star\u2019s.\nEven more intriguing is the fact that, elsewhere, we learn that Dhruva had previously\nbeen one of the names of the Saturnian sun god himself. Thus, the word dhruva means\n\u201cfixed, firm, stable, permanent, constant, unchangeable\u201d'*\u2014which is an apt name for the\nPole Star. Another Sanskrit word with similar meanings of \u201cfixed, firm, unalterable, imper-\nishable, indestructible, undecaying\u201d is akshara.\" It is therefore noteworthy that one of\nVishnu\u2019s epithets is an amalgam of these two words\u2014 Dhruva-akshara. '\u201d\nWe have seen that, according to the Linga Purana, \u201cShaniscara, the slow-moving Saturn,\nis [called] Yama\u201d \u2014a name that was also borne as an epithet by Vishnu. It is interesting, then,\nthat, as Warren tells us, Yama, too, once occupied the north celestial polar station. In his\ntreatment concerning the north polar placement of various deities, he wrote:\n\u201cThat the East Aryans had the same idea is also evident from the Laws of Manu.\nAmong this people Yama\u2014the same as the Iranian Yima\u2014was the first man. His first\nabode...was at the North Pole...\u201d\"*\nAnd, like their Iranian counterparts, and others from other parts of the ancient world, the\nHindus also faced north for divining purposes.\"",

As Warren tells us:\n\u201cThe oldest traceable worship among the Chinese is that of Shang-te [or Shang-ti],\nthe highest of all gods...Shang-te is usually...described as the god of heaven. But his\nproper place of abode, his palace, is called Tsze-wei. And if we inquire as to the\nmeaning and location of Tsze-wei, the native commentators upon the sacred books\ninform us that it is \u2018a celestial space about the North Pole\u2019.\u201d\"\u201d\nThus we find it stated that \u201cShang-te\u2019s throne is in Tsze-wei, i.e., the Polar Star.\u201d And:\n\u201cImmediately over the central peak of Kwen-lun appears the Polar Star, which is Shang-te\u2019s\nheavenly abode.\u201d Shang-ti\u2019s title was The Holy and Propitious Prince of the North Pole.'\u201d\nOne of his symbols, upon which he is sometimes depicted as standing, was the tortoise. The\ntortoise is also sometimes accompanied by a snake. It is therefore noteworthy that the sym-\nbolism of the tortoise and serpent goes at least as far back as the Han dynasty and was used\nas an emblem for the northern region of the world.\u201d\nMore than that, as Lord of the Centre, Shang-ti was also revered as Huang- ti,\u201c who is\nperhaps better known as the Yellow Lord\u2019 or Yellow Emperor.\u2019 The Yellow Emperor has\nperhaps better known as the Yellow Lord\u2019\u00ae or Yellow Emperor. % The Yellow Emperor has\nlong been acknowledged to be the representative of Saturn.\nWhen it comes to ancient Chinese lore, however, we need not merely rely on the mytho-\nhistorical record. Their astronomy echoed the same message. Thus, for instance, the Chinese\nreferred to the Pole Star as T\u2019ien-Tchou which, appropriately enough, means \u201cPivot of the\nSky.\u201d Stars which are close to the Pole Star were also referred to as \u201cpivots.\u201d'* The same\nname was additionally applied to two stars in the constellation Draco\u201d and, since Draco had\nbeen the polar constellation around 2300 B.C., some authorities have concluded that this\nproves that Chinese observational astronomy dates to at least that remote time.\nBe that as it may, the term \u201cpivot\u201d for these Draconian stars fits in with their former\npolar, or near-polar, location. What has baffled commentators on ancient Chinese astronomy,\nhowever, is the fact that the planet Saturn is given the name Tchou-niou-tchi-chin, which\ntranslates as \u201cGenie [or spirit] of the Pivot,\u201d since this is tantamount to calling Saturn \u201cthe\nSoul of the Pole Star.\u201d\nThat, to the Chinese, the planet Saturn once occupied the north polar center is actually\nwell known. As Jan Sammer indicated:\n\u201cAccording to the Han historian Ssuma Ts\u2019ien, the planet Saturn \u2018corresponds to the\ncenter ... Saturn was placed at the pole, and the entire stellar sphere was said to",

In neo-Platonist philosophy, for instance,\nKronos/Saturn was associated with the pole.'\u201d Orphic thought also identified Chronos who,\nas we shall see, was the same as Kronos, as the power behind the turning of the heavens\naround the polar axis.'\" It is therefore no surprise that, when praying, the ancient Greeks,\ntoo, faced to the north. =\nIn time, the sacredness of the north was bound to touch terrestrial realms which, in Euro-\npean thought, remained philologically bound to Saturn through Kronos. The Greeks them-\nselves referred to the North Sea as Kronios Okeanos, or the Saturnian Sea.'\u00ae The adjective\n\u201cCronian,\u201d derived from \u201cKronos,\u201d has even survived in the English language as descriptive\nof the Arctic Ocean.'*\nAs Warren discovered, the same idea persisted in Etruria, before Rome:\n\u201cVarro and other Latin writers confirm this general representation, so that all modern\nexpounders of the old Etruscan religion unite in locating the abode of the gods of\nEtruria in the Centre of Heaven, the northern circumpolar sky. Niebuhr and other au-\nthorities of the highest rank assure us that the Romans shared the same faith.\u201d'*\nThus, Ovid, in his Fasti, offers a description of Creation, at the conclusion of which Janus\nis made to state: \u201cThe guardianship of this vast universe is in my hands alone, and none but\nme may rule the wheeling pole.\u201d * As Roger Ashton indicated:\n\u201cThe centre of the wheeling pole is motionless to the terrestrial observer. Janus, ruler\nof the motionless celestial pole, must thus be located at the Celestial Pole.\u201d 197\nWhen Saturnus was flung down from his celestial seat, he was said to have continued\nruling from \u201cthe opposite end of the world axis,\u201d\"* which presupposes a former position cor-\nresponding to the northern polar station. But even here, we do not really require such a cir-\ncuitous route to the Latin Saturn\u2019s former polar placement since Saturnus himself was re-\nmembered as the god of \u201cthe steadfast star,\u201d\u2019\u201d which star is understood as the Pole Star.",

In fact, as Manly Hall observed:\n\u201cSaturn, the old man who lives at the north pole, and brings with him to the children\nof men a sprig of evergreen (the Christmas tree), is familiar to the little folks under\nthe name Santa Claus.\u201d\nTo be sure, Santa Claus can be said to have had an entirely different origin, one that\nstemmed from the life of Nicholas of Myra. While the history of Nicholas is somewhat ob-\nscure, his cult became a very popular one in Christian circles. What is known of him is that\nhe was the bishop of Myra, in Lycia, a region in present-day Turkey, during the time of the\nRoman emperor Diocletian (A.D. 245-313). Persecuted and tortured for his Christian faith,\nNicholas was then imprisoned until released during the tolerant reign of Constantine. Sancti-\nfied by the Christian Church, he was honored by Latins as well as Greeks by an annual feast\nheld on December 6th.\nNicholas\u2019 connection with the myth of Santa Claus arose out of the legend which claims\nthat he was once responsible for clandestinely bestowing dowries to three daughters of a poor\ncitizen who, not having been able to procure decent marriages for them, was about to give\nthem up to a house of prostitution. This event inaugurated the tradition of giving presents in\nsecret on the eve of his feast day, that is on December Sth.\nThe name Santa Claus itself is merely the English corruption of the Dutch form of Saint\nNicholas\u2014that is Sinterklaas\u2014which transpired when the tradition was introduced to Amer-\nica by early Dutch colonists.\nThere is, of course, no direct connection between Saint Nicholas and the north pole in\nwhich Santa Claus is said to reside. So how did the belief originate?\nThe date of Jesus\u2019 birth has never been ascertained (and it never will be). The Christian\nfeast commemorating the event had originally shifted to and fro all over the calendar. Some-\nwhere around 354 A.D., Latin Christians decided on December 25th since this had been the\ndate on which the feast of Mithra, whose religion had become the main competitor of the\nChristian one, and which had been amalgamated with that of Sol Invictus, was held. This\nraised dissent among the Christian community of other countries, especially among the Syr-\nians and Armenians, who continued to celebrate the birth of Jesus on whatever day their own\ntradition had dictated. In A.D. 440, however, the Fathers of the Christian Church decided to\nrevert to December 25th as the official date since this was also the day of the winter solstice\nwhich had for long been a day of celebration.'\u201d This was also the time during which the feast\nof Saturn, known as the Saturnalia, was celebrated. Originating as a New Year festival, the\nSaturnalia was held on December 17th, but was gradually extended to seven days up to\nDecember 23rd.'\u201d The Greek, and original, version of the Roman Saturnalia, however, was\nthe Greek Kronia, likewise dedicated to Kronos/Saturn, and this used to be held on December",

And it is the collective\nstrength of such traditions, ranging all the way from Sumero/Babylonian times to the present,\nthat impels one to believe that, as far as our ancient forefathers were concerned, the primeval\nsun god had once inhabited that place in Earth\u2019s northern sky that is presently occupied by\nthe Pole Star. Although all this might be new to the public-at-large, I am not revealing an\nthe Pole Star. Although all this might be new to the public-at-large, I am not revealing any,\nesoteric secrets.

As David Talbott noted:\n\u201c,..the tradition of a former polar god or polar sun has been chronicled by a host of\nscholars; together they have succeeded in demonstrating a universal tradition. In the\nlate nineteenth century John J. O\u2019Neill'\u201d even recognized the god as Saturn and had\nto contrive a distinction between the god and the planet to account for the identity.\nLater, the specific connection of the planet [Saturn] with the Pole was noted by\nL\u00e9opold de Saussure. But not one of these innovative researchers ever wondered if\ntheir polar suns or polar gods might have actually been there!\"\u2122\nGiorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend are prime among those who have re-\nsearched the subject, but have objected to a literal interpretation of what these ancient mes-\nsages portray. Since their own research took them far and wide across the entire world in\ndigging through the mytho-historical record, they had no option but to accept that, as far as\nthe ancients were concerned, Saturn had once resided in the place now occupied by the Pole\nStar. \u201cThis is puzzling at first,\u201d they state.\u201d \u201cWhat has Saturn, the far-out planet, to do with\nthe pole?\u201d they ask.\" They even admit that \u201cthe reader is not the first to be perplexed by an\nimagery which allows for the presence of planets at the pole...\u201d\"* And then comes the ob-\njection: \u201cIt is not in the line of modern astronomy to establish any link connecting the planets\nwith Polaris, or with any star, indeed, out of reach of the members of the zodiacal system.\u201d \u2122\nSo how do they explain the ancient belief in Saturn\u2019s former polar placement?

And then, would such\n\u201cfigures of speech\u201d have been incorporated throughout the entire world? Would all the an-\ncient races have chosen the same \u201cfigures of speech\u201d? Would they all have decided to place\nSaturn in a locality it never occupied? And would they all have chosen the north celestial\npole as that locality? What purpose would it have served?\nDespite the fact that, in Ais Saturnian scenario, Lynn Rose opted for an Earth phase-\nlocked with Saturn to account for the latter\u2019s apparent immobility, even he had to admit that,\nas far as the ancients were concerned, Saturn\u2019s stated celestial station was at the north celes-\ntial pole. So how, then, did he get around the mytho-historical record\u2019s obvious message?\nTaking a different, and more plausible, tack than de Santillana and von Dechend, he offered\nthe following:\n\u201cThe traditions about an immovable Saturn atop some special pole made little sense\nafter the Age of Kronos had come to an end. Those traditions were later revised and\nwere attributed to the only \u2018immovable\u2019 point...that could be found in the newer sky.\nTo people in the northern hemisphere...this was the north celestial pole...\u201d\"\u201d\nAnd:\n\u201cAs long as Saturn was atop its pole, the Age of Kronos endured. The immobility of\nthat body was a sign of the stability of the cosmic order. Later...the stability of the\nnorth star was seen as an indication that the world or the world age was not yet com-\ning to an end. The Age of Kronos had ended when the only immobile body in the sky\nhad left its position atop the axis of the world; that was the main reason that the later\nancients looked to the north star: it was now the body that lay atop the axis of the\nworld, and, as long as it remained there, the world was stable. Thus there was a trans-\nfer from Saturn to the north star, with much attendant garbling. Traditions that em-\nphasize the north, and especially those traditions that associate Saturn with the north,\nneed to be interpreted very carefully. After Saturn left us, or we left Saturn, there was\nonly one fixed point in the sky: the celestial pole of rotation...Much that has been\nsaid about Saturn would, in the absence of Saturn, have been transferred to the only\nthing in the new sky that displayed the sort of stability that Saturn had once dis-\nplayed.\u201d\"*\nThus, Rose believes that Saturn\u2019s polar placement was the result of later revisions by\nthose who could not otherwise make sense of the original accounts pertaining to Saturn\u2019s\nimmobility. But, as I had stated once before,\u201d this rationalization is not supported by the\nmytho-historical record. Rose does not even hazard a guess as to when this revision might\nhave taken place or by whom. All he leaves us with is the statement that it happened \u201cafter\nthe Age of Kronos had come to an end.\u201d\nNow, while possible, is it probable that \u201cthese traditions\u201d would have later been\n\u201crevised\u201d just about all over the world? And would they all have been revised in the same\nmanner? Besides, had such revisions occurred, the revisionists would have been bound to\noverlook some data that would contradict the modified scheme. Yet nowhere in the mytho-\nhistorical record can one find such overlooked clues. Could the ancients have been that",

Is it believable that such expurgation would\nhave taken place all over the world with such completeness?\nRose correctly informs us that, during the Saturnian age, the planet\u2019s immobility was tan-\ntamount to cosmic stability. When Saturn\u2019s immobile placement was catastrophically dis-\nplaced, the stability of the cosmic order was impaired. Following this event, the only\nimmobile object in the sky was the North or Pole Star. The immobility of this star became a\nsign of the stability of the new celestial order. It was because of this, according to Rose, that\nSaturn\u2019s former phase-locked immobility was transferred to the North Star\u2019s polar station.\nYet, as we have seen through the parable of Vishnu and Dhruva, the record dictates exactly\nthe opposite \u2014that the polar station had been Saturn\u2019s before it became the Pole Star\u2019s.\nAfter all, what is the point in attempting to reconstruct a cosmic history based on the\nmytho-historical record if one ends up tampering with that record in order to make the data\nfit a different model than the one dictated by the record? As Frederic Jueneman once admon-\nished, \u201cthe tapestry of myth is intricately woven, and each thread must be followed to wher-\never it leads, however improbable the initial appearance.\u201d Despite the fact that Jueneman\nhimself ended up by ignoring his own dictum,\" the point should be well taken. In Rose\u2019s\ncase, his Saturnian model was supposedly constructed on a system said to have been laid out\nby Philolaos. But, as I had indicated in an earlier work,\u201d Rose\u2019s model bears but little re-\nsemblance to that system. When he, therefore, calls his scheme \u201cVariations on a Theme of\nPhilolaos,\u201d the emphasis has to be on \u201cVariations.\u201d Rose himself indicated his awareness of\nthis when he wrote:\n\u201cWe have supposedly been composing variations on a theme of Philolaos, but if there\nis truth in these variations, it will emerge that Philolaos or someone else was compos-\ning variations on another theme, and that what we know as the system of Philolaos is\na garbled and misapplied version of or variations on what was once fact.\u201d '\u00ae\nAll of which explains the changes, assumptions, deductions, arguments, stipulations, sug-\ngestions, ifs, and buts, that Rose was forced to lead his readers through in his effort to make\nsense of this \u201cgarbled\u201d system and force-fit it into one of his own making. As I have pointed\nout once before,\u2019* Rose will be the first to argue that this juggling was necessary to rid the\nsystem of its unrealistic aspects and supplanting them with something more defensible.\nThrough similar procedures, however, the Philolaos system could be turned into any scheme\nof one\u2019s own liking.\nIn our own scheme, as presented in this work, we make no changes to the mytho-histori-\ncal record. We do not assume anything that is not there spelled out. Our deductions are based\non what we find recorded. In other words, heeding Jueneman\u2019s admonition, we have taken,\nas we will continue to take, the mytho-historical record at face value, no matter how\nimprobable its initial appearance may be. There really would be no point in doing otherwise.\nIt may now be objected that had Saturn really occupied a position in Earth\u2019s north celes-\ntial sphere, those people inhabiting Earth\u2019s southern hemisphere would not have been able to\nsee it. It therefore becomes obvious that any beliefs concerning these early cosmic events that",

Ancient\nastronomical beliefs are therefore here being considered together with mythology as a unified\nwhole regardless of the fact that what is thus coming to light tends to describe a Solar System\nthat was entirely alien to the one we now inhabit.\nLater in this work we will attempt a validation of the physical feasibility of the model we\nhave so far delineated, even though not all of the players in this unfolding cosmic scheme are\nyet in place. What I will add here is a reminder to the effect that many were the things once\nthought impossible which were eventually found to be possible, and that many of these ended\nup becoming dogmas of science. Easily coming to mind in this respect are the occurrence of\nmeteoric falls, the non-illusory nature of comets, and continental drift. But let us put all that\naside for the time being.

The theory thus required the same amount of matter\nthat the gravitational model of the universe demanded.\u201d' But where was this dark matter hid-\ning? What did it consist of? As Halton Arp explained:\n\u201cHypotheses include everything from subatomic particles like neutrinos to dark rocks\nsurrounding galaxies...But in actuality, postulating undetected matter is equivalent to\ninventing observations that do not exist in order to explain contradictions to our cur-\nrently assumed physical laws...\u201d\u201d\nIt is not that dark matter is not being looked for.

With his colleagues, Lin set about comparing pho-\ntographs of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a neighboring galaxy, taken in 1974 with others\ntaken in 1989, and measuring \u201cthe almost imperceptible distance\u201d that \u201csome 250 stars\u201d had",

And was this the same as detecting the actual missing mass?\n\nLin himself suggested that the missing mass \u201clies in a halo of dark matter extending\n300,000 light-years or more from our galactic center.\u201d\u201d\u201d A suggestion, however, is one thing;\ndirect proof is something else. As an editorial comment in New Scientist summed it all up\nthat same year, belief in dark matter is akin to that of 19th century scientists who believed in\nthe just as nebulous existence of aether.\u201d\n\nThese two theories\u2014the nuclear fueling of the Sun and the Big Bang\u2014should not, there-\nfore, be allowed to stand, but because science is still optimistic in that it will eventually de-\ntect both the missing neutrinos and the missing dark matter, they are allowed to stand. Per-\nsonally, I shall not be using similar optimism as a crutch in an endeavor to validate the Sat-\nurnian model we have been slowly reconstructing. On the contrary, I aim to present a series\nof demands which this theory raises, both within itself and also through hard science, and\nhow these can be met.\n\nINTERNAL CONSISTENCY\n\nThe first demand of our theory is an obvious one. Seeing as our model has been con-\nstructed on the strength of the mytho-historical record, the theory demands that the mytho-\nhistorical record should be internally consistent. There would be no point in constructing a\nmodel based on a record if that same record contains items which contradict the model being\nconstructed. If the model being constructed is to be considered valid, the record on which it is\nbased must be able to test itself.\n\nAs we have seen, we commenced the construction of our model by zeroing in on the an-\ncient belief that, once upon a time, to use an old clich\u00e9, the planet Saturn was the most\nprominent body in Earth\u2019s sky.\n\nIn order for this datum to be accepted, however, the record should contain additional data\nwhich tell us how the planet Saturn could have appeared as the most prominent body in the\nsky. This demand was met when we found it stated in the same record that Saturn had previ-\nously shone as a sun; that it was at that time the only visible body in the sky; and that it was",

The tides\nbecome much higher when the Sun and Moon apply their combined attractive forces when in\ndirect line with each other.\n\nNow consider: With the massive Saturn in proximity to Earth, the tides that would have\nbeen raised should have exceeded those at present. More than that, with Saturn having been\npositioned in Earth\u2019s north celestial sphere, terrestrial tides should have accumulated at\nEarth\u2019s north polar region. The hydrosphere, moreover, would not have been the only terres-\ntrial element to respond to Saturn\u2019s attractive force. The atmosphere should also have piled\nup at Earth\u2019s northern areas. And so, also, should have Earth\u2019s crust. This, then, is what the\nSaturn thesis demands. Do we find it so?\n\nWell, let us be fair now. What was, no longer is, so that we cannot now take a trip up\nnorth to see if the water of the world is actually piled up in a tide around the north pole.\nEarth\u2019s crust, however, is a different matter. Earth\u2019s hydrosphere and atmosphere would have\neasily rebounded to settle in a more uniform shell around the world once the linear link with\nSaturn was broken. Earth\u2019s crust, on the other hand, would have taken a much longer period\nto re-adjust to the new conditions. And since the scenario we have been positing is theorized\nto have played its drama just prior to the rise of civilization, we should expect this northern\nlithospheric bulge not yet to have entirely subsided. Do we find any evidence of it?\n\nOf course we do\u2014and it has been known since 1958. This might come as a surprise to\nsome because we have been taught since childhood that Earth is an imperfect sphere which is\nslightly flattened at the poles and distended at the equator.

True,\nKing-Hele was here appealing to glacial rebound, but it must be kept in mind that the melting\nand re-solidifying of glacial ice occurred simultaneously in both the north and south poles.\nGlacial rebound should therefore also have been simultaneous. So why would this isostatic\nrebound create a lithospheric bulge only in the north? Frederick Hall proved more astute\nwhen he pointed out that:\n\u201c[{The phenomenon] poses a question which, though obvious, is virtually never asked.\nWhat pulled Earth out of shape from above its north pole? \u201c*\nNow it is true that Earth\u2019s bulge has been measured at only 10 meters (33 feet),\u00b0> al-\nthough others have vouched for as much as 18 meters. This might not be considered much of\na bulge but, as a residue, or remnant, of a former greater uplift of land, even meters are of\nsignificance. As Hall indicated:\n\"The small dimensions of this shift indicate the pull was short term (as in centuries to\nmillennia) rather than eons. Furthermore the effect is relaxing, and in geological\nterms the distorting influence must have been remarkably recent.\u201d*\u00b0\nLeroy Ellenberger, an avowed antagonist of the Saturn thesis, found fault with this theo-\nretical base.

How does he know how far Saturn\nwas from Earth in order to deduce the height of Earth\u2019s tidal bulge under its influence? How\ndoes he know how long this tidal bulge would have existed? And how does he know when\nthe Saturnian configuration disrupted? I, for one, had never as much as hinted at these pa-\nrameters and, without knowing any of these quantities, nothing can be said concerning the\nheight of the original bulge or to what extent it should have relaxed by now. (Besides, as El-\nlenberger himself knows, and as others have pointed out,\u201d it was not just the positioning of\nSaturn above Earth\u2019s northern pole that was responsible for raising the world\u2019s lithospheric\nbulge. There were additional forces which came into play, but it would be premature at this\npoint to go into all that.)\n\nAnd then, is it just the northern bulge per se that we should be concerned with? What\nabout the fact that Earth\u2019s crust is generally thicker in the northern hemisphere than it is in\nthe southern? Sure enough, this has been explained as arising from the additional fact that\n\u201cmost dry land exists north of the equator,\u201d\u201d but it has never been asked why this should be\nthe case.\n\nExponents of the continental drift theory look at the configuration of Earth\u2019s land masses\nand conclude that the continents must have once been joined together. I look at the same con-\nfiguration and see something else. I do not, by this, deny continental drift and plate tectonics.\nBut consider:\n\nTwo of the biggest continents on Earth, and India also, taper toward the south pole. None\ntaper toward the north. The highest percentage of Earth\u2019s land masses, as noted above, occurs\nnorth of the equator; the highest percentage of the Earth\u2019s oceans, south of the equator. In the\nextreme north, the continents come together at the \u201ctop\u201d of the world to form a circle which\nis filled with the Arctic Ocean. As if to counterbalance this, in the extreme south we see that\nit is the oceans which come together at the \u201cbottom\u201d of the world to form a circle which is\nfilled with the Antarctic continent. Earth\u2019s axis passes from the centre of the Arctic Ocean to\nthe centre of Antarctica. Is this merely fortuitous? Is it merely by chance that Earth\u2019s land\nmasses are mainly congregated in the north? (As to whether or not the Arctic Ocean existed\nduring the era of Saturn\u2019s proximity, I shall leave to a future work.)\n\nThere is another problem to consider. Encircling the Arctic Ocean is a blanket of detritus\nknown as muck. This area is so vast it actually covers one seventh of Earth\u2019s land surface.\u201d\nThis muck is composed of deep-frozen \u201cgoo with silt, sand, pebbles, and boulders, often with\nmasses of preserved, semi-decayed, or fully decayed vegetable and animal matter.\u201d This\nfrozen mess lies on low level plains.

The Russians, who own the major\nland areas covered by this substance have conducted prolonged studies on it for\n[over] half a century, and have in some places drilled down to over 4,000 feet but still\nwithout reaching solid rock.\u201d\nAlthough we will have much more to say about the formation of this muck in a future\nwork, the problem we wish to focus on here is this: From what heights did this material\nerode?

As a matter of fact, it does. This\nwas discovered by orbiting Apollo spacecraft using \u201ca laser device to measure accurately the\nheights of features over much of the lunar surface.\u201d What came to light is that the Moon,\nrather than being a perfect sphere, is actually slightly egg-shaped, with its narrow end point-\ning toward Earth. This lithospheric bulge rises 2 kilometers above the lunar surface. Unlike\nEarth\u2019s northern distortion, this is a \u201cliving\u201d bulge, not the remnant of one. Even so, as Har-\nold Urey noted, this lunar ellipticity \u201cis some seventeen times as great as would be calcu-\nlated from present tidal forces.\u201d What Urey is saying here is that Earth\u2019s pull on the Moon",

By the same token, however\u2014and this might\ncome as a surprise to some readers\u2014 neither is the Moon\u2019s gravitational pull powerful\nenough to raise oceanic tides.\u201d And yet it does.\nAnother objection raised by Urey is that it \u201cis difficult to believe that the interior of the\nMoon can support such stresses for geological periods of time.\u201d*' That may be so, but the\nbulge is there, so that no matter what forces came into play to raise it, the \u201cinterior of the\nMoon\u201d does presently support it. There is no point in saying that this is impossible.\nMoreover, as Keith Runcorn admitted, under present conditions, the lunar bulge \u201cwould\nhave disappeared long ago.\u201d\u201d For that reason, some authorities have been claiming that the\nlunar bulge is not raised by tidal forces, but by some other unknown mechanism. However,\nwhile this is not the place to go into this particular subject, the height of the lunar bulge\nwould conform rather well if it was formed relatively recently, even more recently than the\nterrestrial one, under conditions other than those presently postulated.\nOne other thing to keep in mind here is that, given what we know, or think we know,\nabout tidal forces, Earth is bound to tidally affect the lunar surface, and that this effect is\nbound to manifest itself on the lunar hemisphere facing Earth. So that if the lunar bulge in\nquestion is not the result of Earth\u2019s tidal attraction, where, then, is the manifestation of that\nforce?\nNow, as it happens, Ellenberger has had reason to raise further objections to our hypothe-\nsis concerning Earth\u2019s lithospheric bulge. As he had it stated:\n\u201c...were the miniscule northern bulge manifested in the geoid truly of tidal origin as\nclaimed, then the geoid would not be pear-shaped, but would instead be a prolate el-\nlipsoid, with the bulges at north and south. This follows from the elementary fact that\ntidal bulges express themselves on both the near and far side of the subject body, as\nwith the lunar tide which occurs twice a day...\u201d\nRoy Gallant succinctly explained the phenomenon in the following words:\n\u201cGravitation, remember, weakens as distance becomes greater. So the Moon tugs with\ngreater force on that side of Earth facing the Moon, with less force on matter at\nEarth\u2019s center, and with the least force on Earth\u2019s far side. A second tidal bulge thus\nforms on the far side where a hill of water is \u2018left behind\u2019. Since this water is farthest\naway from the Moon, it is tugged with the least force.\u201d\nThe fact that lunar tides affect Earth\u2019s oceanic waters twice a day is due to Earth\u2019s rota-\ntion as it catches up with the secondary tidal bulge. But even this is nothing but an idealized",

There are many areas which are af-\nfected by only one tide per lunar day.*\n\nEven so, why did not Earth develop a secondary bulge at its south pole?\n\nActually, who can say it did not? To begin with, the hydrosphere is one thing, the litho-\nsphere is something else. Water, being a liquid, responds much easier to tidal forces than\ndoes the solid lithosphere. And then, with the pull from the stationary Saturn being weakest\nat Earth\u2019s south pole, a secondary bulge at that location would have been much lower than\nthe northern one. Who is to say that a southern bulge did not form under Saturn\u2019s constant\npull and that this bulge, being much lower than its northern counterpart, has since completely\nsettled down?\n\nOf course, we can never know whether such a southern bulge ever formed. But then, is it\nadamant that such a southern bulge should have formed? There is no secondary bulge on the\nMoon counteracting the one facing Earth. But because this lunar bulge has been disqualified\nas a tidal one, we look for a better example. I therefore point to Phobos, one of the Moons of\nMars, an irregular chunk of rock measuring a mere seventeen miles across its longest axis. It,\ntoo, exerts a gravitational pull on Mars and, yes, it, too, raises a slight bulge on that planet.\u201d\nBecause Phobos orbits the planet faster than Mars is able to rotate, this Martian bulge tends\nto lag behind\u2014but there it is, and there is no opposing secondary bulge to counteract it.\n\nBut then how much do we really know about tidal forces? We know so little about them\nthat we cannot even predict the tide for any point on an ocean.* Oh yes, we can forecast the\ntides for all principal ports and other shore lines, but \u201cthese are not computed from general\ntheory...but from analysis of tidal records over a long period of years at the particular port\nconcerned.\u201d\u00ae\n\nThere is also no point in appealing to Isaac Newton\u2019s laws because the Newtonian\nscheme fails to explain these vagaries.\u201d As James Gilluly and his associates pointed out:\n\u201cThese and many other facts make it clear that the tides are not a simple direct response to\nthe vertical component of the moon\u2019s gravitational pull, which is really far too small for ef-\nfective lifting of the water masses anyway.\u201d*' Granted that these words were written in 1951,\nin the interim nothing much has changed in that respect\n\nSo what, then, is the bottom line? From the little we know about tidal forces, the Sat-\nurnian model we have been investigating still demands that a lithospheric bulge would have\nbeen raised at Earth\u2019s north pole, and that this bulge would have subsided somewhat once\nEarth\u2019s linear alignment with Saturn was broken. The remnant of such a northern lithospheric\nbulge exists to this day. We can therefore safely claim that this demand is met.",

Let us then continue to re-examine\nthem.\nThe father of all Creation myths, at least in the Western World, is that contained in the\nvery first chapter of the Book of Genesis. It is there stated that:\n\u201cIn the beginning Elohim created the shemayim and \u2018eretz. And \u2018eretz was tohu wa\nbohu, and darkness was on the surface of the tehom. And the ruach of Elohim moved\nupon the face of the mayim.\u201d*\nAs we have already seen, Elohim was one of the ancient names of Saturn. Shemayim are\n\u201cthe heavens\u201d\u2014in the plural. Eretz is the word usually translated as \u201cEarth,\u201d but it more\nthe plural.\nproperly means \u201cland.\u201d The words tohu wa bohu are traditionally translated as \u201cwithout form\nand void\u201d or \u201cvoid and empty.\u201d The tehom is understood as a watery abyss\u2014the deep. Ruach\nmeans \u201cspirit\u201d or \u201csoul,\u201d but also \u201cwind,\u201d while the mayim are merely \u201cthe waters\u201d \u2014also in\nWhat follows might offend those of a religious bent but, in a scholarly work, this cannot\nalways be helped. Devoid of all religious significance, what the words of Genesis actually\ntell us is that, \u201cin the beginning\u201d \u2014that is, as far back as man can remember\u2014Saturn fash-\nioned the \u201cland\u201d\u2014which originally meant the land of the gods\u2014which was formless and\nempty, while the \u201cspirit,\u201d or \u201cwind,\u201d of the same Saturn moved over the darkened waters.\nCHAOS\nTohu wa bohu, however, can also mean \u201cutter chaos.\u201d\u00b0 Thus, in the Phoenician cosmog-\nony of Philo Byblius, we find \u201cdark chaos\u201d presiding as the ruling principle before Creation.\u2019\nIt was no different among the ancient Greeks. In describing the Creation as remembered\nby his countrymen, Hesiod asks: \u201cFrom the beginning, which first came to be?\u201d And he an-\nswers: \u201cChaos was first of all...\u201d \u00ae Thus, according to Hesiod, in the beginning there was\nnothing but Chaos, \u201cvast and dark.\u201d This Chaos was surrounded by Night,'\u00b0 which means\nsurrounded by, or enveloped in, darkness.\nGuirand tells us that, among the Greeks, Chaos was \u201ca pure cosmic principle devoid of\ngod-like characteristics.\u201d'' In this, however, he was simply falling prey to a later philosophic\ndoctrine. Guirand also muddles the issue when he claims that \u201cthe first principle was Cronus,\nor Time, from which came Chaos, which symbolized the infinite...\u201d!? It is obvious that, here,",

Thus, despite the different terms in which it is couched, the entity being described, this\nTao, appears to be no different than that described by other races as the first principle from\nwhich Creation was said to have proceeded.\nIt is upon this \u201call-embracing First Principle\u201d that Lao-tzu was able to base an entire\nphilosophy whose influence on Chinese thought, art, and literature, despite varying interpre-\ntation, has been prodigious. Taoism, in fact, became the dominant philosophy, called Tao-\nchia, and even religion, differentiated as Tao-chiao, of China. But that the basic idea behind\nboth derives from the primeval events with which we are presently concerned, there seems to\nbe no doubt.\nTHE NEBULAR CLOUD\nA Yuki Creation myth refers to this indistinct something as a \u201cfog\u201d and/or \u201cfoam\u201d that\n\u201cmoved round and round continually\u201d during a time, in the beginning, when there was yet \u201cno\nlight.\u201d\u201d' A similar fog is also mentioned in Oceanic mythology. From Nias we have the fol-\nlowing: \u201cIn the beginning there was a thick fog, which condensed and became a being without\nspeech or movement or head or arms or legs.\u201d\u201d This being, without head or arms or legs,\nreminds us of the Eskimo entity Ataksak, whom we have already met, who also was a being\nwithout arms and legs and who, very much like the Latin Janus/Saturn, existed in the shape of\na sphere. It should also be noted that, while the entity which emerged from the fog was said to\nhave been without movement, which accords well with Saturn\u2019s immobility, the lack of mo-\ntion does not necessary apply to the fog itself. Here, then, we seem to catch sight of what\nmight have been a spherical body emerging out of a substance which had the appearance of a\nfog.\nIn their Creation myth, the Pima state that:\n\u201cIn the beginning there was nothing at all except darkness. All was darkness and\nemptiness. For a long, long while, the darkness gathered until it became a great mass.\nOver this the spirit of Earth Doctor drifted to and fro like a fluffy bit of cotton in the\nbreeze. Then the Earth Doctor decided to make for himself an abiding place.\u201d\u201d\nIt is obvious that the entity that was eventually translated into English as \u201cEarth Doctor\u201d\nwas the Pima Creator. Meanwhile, a rotating \u201cfog,\u201d \u201cfoam,\u201d and/or \u201cfluffy cotton\u201d in dark-\nness seems to imply a spinning nebular cloud.

Thus, van der Waerden tells us that, in Armenian texts,\nSaturn is called Zruan which is the same as Zurvan.\u201d The later worshippers of Mithra were\nnot therefore wrong when they identified Kronos, the Greek Saturn, with Zurvan.\u201d Actually,\nthe identity of Zurvan as Saturn is well attested.\u2019\n\nThe implication here is that this nebular cloud was spun off by the rotating Saturnian\nbody out of which the solitary deity\u2014i.e. Saturn\u2014slowly emerged into view. A near-identi-\ncal idea was later proposed by David Talbott when he stated that: \u201cThere is also evi-\ndence...that the participating planets [of the Saturnian system] moved through a diffuse\ngaseous envelope, which almost certainly would have prevented a view of the stars.\u201d*\u201d\n\nGriffard\u2019s 1979 suggestion, that an obscuration of sorts could have been emitted by the\nplanet Saturn itself, directed me to the so-called accretion disc, or placental cloud, from\nwhich the planets of the Solar System were supposed to have accreted. Dramatic paintings of\nsuch clouds by noted space artists such as Chesley Bonestell\u00ae have appeared quite regularly\nin astronomical journals and illustrated coffee-table books. Turning such pictures upside\ndown, so that I could view the entire panorama from below instead of from above, gave me\nan inkling of what Saturn might have looked like had it also been surrounded by a similar\nplacental cloud. The sky would have been almost completely obscured by the colossal\nnebular disc. Part of Saturn\u2019s southern hemisphere would have protruded through its\nequatorial cloud, thus rendering itself quite clearly as a dull red disc to human eyes. What\nintrigued me about these graphic illustrations many years later was that these circumstellar\nclouds all had the appearance of a whirlpool that seemed to be composed of both fog and\ndirty foam (and even greenish fluffy cotton), thus rendering them somewhat comparable to\nwhat was described in some of the myths paraded in the previous section.\n\nA similar doughnut of gas was found surrounding a nearby star by space scientists at the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, in 1985.* Dust disks around so-called newborn stars were",

It has, for in-\nstance, been suggested by Barry Frank that, keeping in mind that vowels were inserted into\nHebrew at a late date, the consonants which spell \u201cElohim\u201d can be read as \u201cEl ha Yam,\u201d\nwhich means \u201cGod of the Sea.\u201d The same derivation was suggested six years later by Pro-",

To be sure, this derivation of the name will remain controversial, but\nwe do not really require it in making our case. As Frank Moore Cross has indicated, the idea\nthat Elohim was a god of the sea actually traces to an ancient belief. An old tradition which\nhe cited has the deity unequivocally stating: \u201cI am El, in the seat of Elohim I am enthroned in\nthe midst of the seas.\u201d*\n\nElsewhere, however, the Egyptian Nu\u2014this \u201cprimeval abyss of water\u201d \u2014is alluded to as\npautet or pautti, which has been translated as \u201cprimeval matter.\u201d Thus Ra is made to state: \u201cI\nproduced myself from the primeval matter [which] I made.\u201d \u201cI produced myself from prime-\nval matter.\u201d \u201cI came into being from the primeval matter...\u201d\n\nIt is obvious from all the above that man did not know what he was looking at. If the cir-\ncumstellar disk we have been postulating as having surrounded Saturn was a fact, we can un-\nderstand man remembering it as a nebulosity, something indistinct. We can also understand\nhis likening it to swirling fog, foam, or fluffy cotton, even a churning of mud or slime, a cha-\notic mess, primeval matter\u2014 but water? Why water?\n\nTHE WATERS OF CHAOS\n\nUp until 1979, I had held the view that the waters of chaos had actually been terrestrial.\nIn fact I had already earlier described these waters as having been piled up in a tidal heap due\nto the gravitational pull of Saturn which hovered overhead.\u201d Although I still hold to a col-\nlection of water piled up at Earth\u2019s north polar regions, a topic which will be explored in a\nfuture volume, I eventually came to realize, primarily on following the advice of Roger\nAshton and David Lorton, to reconsider ancient testimony concerning the celestial nature of\nthe waters of chaos spoken of in relation to Creation. The celestial nature of these waters is\nperhaps best indicated in Egyptian myth. Traditionally, the Egyptian waters of chaos which,\nas we have just seen, were collectively known as Nu, were unequivocally described as having\nbeen in the sky. Of that there was never any doubt. As Budge tells us, \u201cthe name Nu...is ex-\npressed by three vases of water which indicate the sound, and the outstretched heaven...and",

The more important question remains: What were these celestial wa-\nters?\nTHE WHIRL OF CREATION\nAll these, and other, myths of celestial waters led Roger Ashton to assume that there must\nhave been some celestial phenomenon resembling shimmering waters, possibly an auroral\neffect, surrounding the primeval Saturnian orb.\u00ae As he also elsewhere stated, \u201cpart of that\nassemblage must have looked like waters, whose implicitly or explicitly celestial character\nhas severally been noted\u201d and that these \u201cwaters evidently appeared in a distinct image or\npattern.\u201d*' But while an auroral effect might resemble shimmering water, and while this\ncould also be called an indistinct entity, even a nebulosity, it is doubtful that it would also",

On the water was\nfoam. The foam moved round and round continually...After a time there is-\nsued from the foam a person in human form...This was Taik\u00e9-mol [Solitude\nWalker]. He floated on the water...He stood on the foam, which still revolved.\nThere was no light.\u201d\"*\nThe Algonquins believed in an \u201cearth\u201d that existed \u201canterior to this of ours, but one\nwithout light.\u201d'\u00b0 The Zuni claim that:\n\u201cIn the beginning of things Awonawilona was alone. There was nothing beside\nhim in the whole space of time. Everything there was black darkness and void.\u201d\nAwonawilona is described as \u201cone who contains everything,\u201d\u201d which reminds us of\nthe Arabic Suhail (Suhayl and/or Sahel) which, as the primordial star, was \u201cpresented under\nthe form of an egg that contained all things that were to be born.\u201d\u201d Awonawilona\u2019s attrib-\nutes also brings to mind the Egyptian Atum, the root of whose name\u2014tm\u2014means \u201cto be\ncomplete\u201d thus also connoting \u201cone who contains everything.\u201d\nThere is hardly a North American tribe that does not have a Creation myth in which\nthe primeval ocean and/or prolonged darkness was said to have existed before the demiurge\ncommenced on his work of Creation.\u201d Over and again, we hear that there was darkness\u2014or a\nprolonged night\u2014in which there was no Sun, no Moon, no stars. In the telling, of course,\nmany of these myths acquired a fanciful cast and framework that sometimes borders on\nchildish fable. But that, after all, is the nature of allegory and myth.",

Os-\nborne noted:\n\u201cSome mythological cycles feature a primitive age of darkness before the ex-\nistence of the sun, when human beings lived in a state of anarchy without the\ntechniques of civilized life.\u201d\u201d\nIna similar vein, Juan de Betanzos narrates the following:\n\u201cThey say that in ancient times the land of Peru was dark and there was no\nlight nor day in it. In those times there dwelt there a certain people who owed\nallegiance to an overlord whose name they no longer remember. And they say\nthat in those times when all was night in the land there came forth from a lake\nin the district called Collasuyu, a Lord named Con Ticci Viracocha...And\nwhile he was there...he suddenly made the sun and the day and commanded\nthe sun to follow the course which it does follow...They say that this Con\nTicci Viracocha had emerged on an earlier occasion and that on this first ap-\npearance he made the heaven and the earth and left everything dark.\u201d*\u00b0\nSimilarly, an account by Sarmiento de Gamboa states that:\n\u201cThe natives of this country [i.e., Peru] say that in the beginning, before the\nworld was created, there was one whom they called Viracocha. And he cre-\nated the world dark and without the Sun, nor Moon, nor stars.\u201d*!\n\u201cThe Sun, according to Sarmiento\u2019s narrative,\u201d Jan Sammer informs us, \u201cemerged\nonly after the Deluge.\u201d\nIt seems, then, that even the famous Kon Tiki (Con Ticci) was none other than a Sat-\nurnian figure, and the \u201clake\u201d from which it was said he emerged nothing but the dim memory\nof the ancient waters of chaos. The description of this god as a fair-skinned, red-bearded man\nhas captured the imagination of western chroniclers but, among the original natives, this be-\nlief was not unanimous. Besides, that Viracocha was a celestial deity is ascertained by his\nhaving been lauded as \u201cThou who art in the high heavens...\u201d\nAlso:",

As we have seen, it was only through creation that\nJanus \u201cassumed the face and members of a god.\u201d Similarly, the Egyptian creator was \u201ca\nformless god [who] stood alone in the \u2018waters\u2019 of the sky...a sphere without external \u2018at-\ntributes\u2019 or \u2018limbs\u2019.\u201d*\u00b0\nReturning to Kon Tiki Viracocha, we learn that:\n\u201cIn all the accounts, whatever the regional variations, this hero always ap-\npeared as a god-creator who intervened in a world which was already cre-\nated...but unorganized...Viracocha\u2019s role was therefore to transform chaos\ninto cosmos...\u201d\u00b0>\nMoreover, this myth of the Collao seems to imply that the \u201cearth\u201d which existed prior\nto the creation, or appearance, of light was also considered a creation of Kon Tiki. This belief\nis not to be wondered at for it seems doubtful that man remembers a god older than the Sat-\nurnian figure. But it does seem that he remembers a time when the Sun was not yet apparent\nin the sky. Thus, another myth from the same region explicitly states: \u201cIn the most ancient\ntimes the earth was covered in darkness and there was no sun.\u201d*\u201d The Popul Vuh also relates\nthat before the \u201cearth\u201d was created, \u201cthere was only motionless sea\u201d and \u201cit was night; si-\nlence stood in the dark.\u201d** And again, from a Xingu myth we learn that:\n\u201cIn the beginning it was all dark. It was always night. There was no day.\u201d\u201d\u201d\nTHE ENDLESS SEA\nWe cross the Pacific to the archipelagos of Micronesia where we find that a pre-ex-\nisting \u201crock\u201d was believed to have been the matrix of the \u201cuniverse.\u201d But even this \u201crock of\nages\u201d is \u201cassociated with an endless stretch of original sea\u201d from which the first gods were\nproduced.\u201d The Polynesians also state that, \u201cin the beginning\u201d there was no light. \u201cA brood-",

The nights would be millions in the long night to name; it was\nthe long, wearisome night, the night of Rumia!\u201d>\nWhile this darkness was described as having been primarily in the sky, in which the\ncreator was seen to hover, it does not seem to have restricted itself to the celestial waters.\nSince this darkness was said to have preceded the appearance of the Sun, as is also implied in\nGenesis, it would necessarily mean that the entire sky was immersed in it. Needless to say,\nsuch a darkness could not but have touched Earth and, in fact, many of the myths we have\nalready enumerated more than intimate this. In some instances, the myths themselves actually\nstate as much.\nIt therefore becomes obvious that the age of darkness preceded the time when Saturn\nshone as a true sun. As we have seen, time and again we are told that, during this age of\ndarkness, no Sun, no Moon, no stars were seen. It therefore seems that we are still missing\nsomething crucial. What was it that hid the Sun, the Moon, and the stars from view?\nAnother problem that arises at this point, of course, has to do with life itself. Could\nlife, let alone man, have existed during a protracted period during which Earth would have\nbeen immersed in darkness?",

A moment\u2019s\nlight.\nreflection, however, should tell one that, for anything to have been visible, there must\nat least have been a modest amount of illumination. Even though not yet glorious as a\nsun, Saturn must have still shed some light. And, to be sure, the mytho-historical record is not\nexactly silent on this.\nThe Book of the Secrets of Enoch describes the beginning of Creation in a somewhat\nfuller manner than does the Book of Genesis. It is from its pages that we learn of the uncoil-\ning of Adoil as the very genesis of this process. In the quote that follows, God is describing\nto Enoch the manner in which he created the cosmos:\n\u201cI commanded in the very lowest parts that visible things should come down\nfrom invisible, and Adoil came down very great, and I beheld him, and lo! he\nhad a belly of great light.\n\u201cAnd I said to him: \u2018Become undone, Adoil, and let the visible come out of\nthee.\u2019\n\u201cAnd he became undone...\u201d!\nThe name \u201cAdoil,\u201d also \u201cIdoil,\u201d probably derives from the Hebrew id El, that is\n\u201chand of God\u201d or, more appropriately, \u201chand of El,\u201d? that is Saturn. The coming undone of\nAdoil, meanwhile, presupposes that the planetary deity had originally been tightly coiled,\nwhich is not at odds with our hypothesized nebular cloud. Note, however, that Adoil is\nclaimed to have had \u201ca belly of great light\u201d even before he became undone to release that\nThe Eskimo entity known as Raven, whom we have already identified through the\nrules of comparative mythology as a representation of the Saturnian creator, was also said to\nhave first existed in darkness. But there is something else of interest that is contained in this\nmyth as paraphrased by Marion Wood:",

He was still small and weak and his special powers had not fully\ndeveloped.\u201d?\nGranted that nothing is here said about Raven having contained, or emitted, any light,\nthe fact that he was described as having still been \u201csmall and weak\u201d hints at the apparent in-\neffectuality of the entity involved; as so, incidentally, does the disclosure that his \u201cspecial\npowers had not [yet] fully developed.\u201d What this tells us is that Raven/Saturn had not yet\nevolved into the glorious sun of night described by other races.\nA tale similar to that of Adoil comes to us from South America. A. Metraux relates it\nin the following words:\n\u201cHere is the tale of creation as told by the Chibcha Indians of Colombia.\nWhen it was dark, before anything in the world existed, light was enclosed in\nsomething big, which the Muiscas called \u2018Chiminagua\u2019.\u201d*\nThat this light of Chiminagua, like that of Adoil, was later released presupposes its\npre-existence. Something similar is unequivocally stated in the Linga Purana where we read:\n\u201cWhen the night of Brahma born of the unmanifest reached the stage of dawn,\nthis visible universe was one that had not been analyzed. It was still enveloped\nin the nocturnal darkness...[but] the self-born lord, he who achieves all the af-\nfairs of the worlds, moved about like a glow-worm, with a desire to mani-\nfest.\u201d\nWhat we are here told, then, is that not only was the universe\u2014i.e. this\n\u201cAll\u201d \u2014 originally in darkness, but Brahma, whom we have already identified as Saturn, radi-\nated but only feebly, \u201clike a glow-worm.\u201d This is like saying that Saturn\u2019s glow was not\nenough to dissipate the darkness.\nAccording to the Mbay\u00e9:\n\u201c...the First Being [whom they called Namandui and/or the Namandu Fa-\nther]...made darkness. He made the cradle of darkness...[but] he did not see\n[this] darkness, though the sun did not yet exist. He was lit by the reflection of\nhis own inner self.\u201d",

The Saturnian milieu we have been examining need not have been that much differ-\nent.\n\nEven so, the problem remains: After all, at present, night gives way to day. But could\nlife have survived in a dark environment that lasted for ages without the light of day?\n\nCREATURES OF THE DARK\n\nSunlight is not essential to life per se.\n\nMicroscopic bacteria are known to live in the ground, entirely bereft of light, endur-\ning extreme temperatures, and thriving on a diet of metals and sulfur. Some of these mi-\ncrobes get their energy \u201cby digesting compounds containing copper, arsenic, bismuth, molyb-\ndenum, nickel, antimony, uranium, vanadium and zinc.\u201d As they digest this hellish banquet,\nthe microbes excrete pools of sulfuric acid. Ever since the 1970s, this knowledge has been\nsuccessfully utilized in the mining of metals by introducing such bacterial organisms which\nextract metals from ores by simply digesting them.\u00b0\n\nMethane-producing microbes known as Archaea live at great marine depths in a sun-\nless world close to abysmal hydrothermal vents. Nor are microbes the only forms of life that\ncluster around these orifices. In the 1970s, scientists discovered that flues near the Galdpagos\nIslands support a thriving community of bacteria, tube worms, and even clams \u201cwhose pri-\nmary source of energy is not light but sulfur compounds emitted by the vents.\u201d\"\u00b0\n\nTwo large communities thriving in similar sites were discovered in the eastern Pa-\ncific, a few hundred miles from Easter Island, in May 1981 by members of the Woods Hole\nOceanographic Institution and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Apart from bacteria,\nworms, and clams, these communities also contained mussels, starfish and actual fish which\nwere photographed at depths reaching 9,000 feet.

Scientists working at the New Millennium Observatory, which monitors the\nocean bottom some 290 miles off the Oregon coast, were offered the chance to study the\ndrifting of continents at first hand.

To quote Rachel Carson:\n\u201cFor the darkness of the lower depths has forced many creatures to make their\nown light. Perhaps half of the fishes that live in dimly lit or darkened water, as\nwell as many of the lower forms, are phosphorescent. Many fishes carry\ntorches that can be turned on or off at will, presumably to help them find or\npursue their prey. Others have rows of light over their bodies, in patterns that\nvary from species to species. This may be a sort of recognition mark or badge\nby which the fish can be known as friend or enemy.\u201d\u201d!\nMoreover:\n\u201cDown beyond the reach of even the longest and strongest of the sun\u2019s rays,\nthe eyes of fishes are different. They become enlarged, as though to make the\nmost of any chance light of whatever sort. Or they may be telescopic, large of\nlens, and protruding. Some fishes, on the other hand, have become blind, as\nhas happened to certain cave animals that live in a world of darkness. To\nmake up for their lack of eyes, the blind animals of the sea have marvelous\nfeelers and long, slender fins. With these they grope their way like so many\nblind men with canes. They get their knowledge of enemies or food through\nthe sense of touch.\u201d\u201d\nSea plants do not grow at these depths so that these \u201chungry flesh-eaters prey fiercely\nupon each other, yet the whole community depends in the end upon the slow rain of food\nparticles descending from above.\u201d\u201d The fierceness of the death struggles that must go on in\nthis Stygian gloom \u201cis seen in the saber-toothed jaws of some of the small, dragonlike fishes\nof the deeper waters, in the immense mouths, and in the elastic bodies that make it possible\nfor a fish to swallow another several times its size [where] pressure and darkness are the\nconditions of life...\u201d\nSulfur-sustained life is found not only around deep sea vents, but also up on land, out\nof the sea, in caverns as dark as the oceans\u2019 abysmal depths.

And yet, the\nchemistry of photosynthesis is identical in all these plants. What actually transpires is that\nphotosynthesis proceeds at a rate that is directly proportional to the incident radiation in\nwhich the light energy is utilized with the greatest efficiency. Moreover, it has been calcu-\nlated that only about one to three percent of the light falling on any plant is actually trans-\nformed into chemical energy. Most of the Sun\u2019s radiation falling on a plant is lost through\nreflection and ineffective absorption by pigments other than chlorophyll (or, at least, other\nthan those pigments in the chloroplasts).\nHow does all this affect our progressing theoretical construct?\nWell, for one thing, Sunlight being starlight, photosynthesis would have been able to\noccur just as well under the light shed by the brown dwarf star that once was Saturn. Its\ndimmer light would have been compensated for by the plants\u2019 ability to control absorption in\nproportion to the incident radiation falling upon them.\nEqually significant to our study is the fact that red light is the most important spec-\ntrum necessary for the growing of plants.\u201d' Brown dwarf stars are known to radiate a propen-\nsity of red light. Thus, the spectrum of received light on Earth during the Saturnian period\nwould have been much redder than at present and, therefore, more conducive to plant\ngrowth.\nThe brown dwarf star that was Saturn would have also radiated ultraviolet light.\u201d But\nthen so does the Sun. Ultraviolet rays are normally considered relatively harmless and even\nbeneficial. Long-term exposure to high concentrations of these rays can, however, also prove\nharmful. We have no way of knowing how highly concentrated the ultraviolet rays from Sat-\nurn would have been. Since, even at its best, the Saturnian sun was feebler than the Sun, it is\nquite possible that its ultraviolet radiation would also have been feebler. During the age of\nsemi-darkness with which we are presently concerned, when Saturn had not yet flared up as a\ntrue sun, its entire radiation might have been feebler still. In the meantime, it has been found\nthat mosses in the Antarctic region are able to produce certain compounds which act to pro-\ntect them against excessive ultraviolet radiation.* Who is to say that other plants might not\nhave derived the same ability during the Saturnian era of semi-darkness had our brown dwarf\nprimary radiated excessive ultraviolet rays?\nTHE REQUIRED TEMPERATURE\nLight and photosynthesis, however, are not the only requirements for the subsistence\nof plants and animals.

But sci-\nentists have since discovered a rich array of organisms tucked away in isolated\nhabitats. Robert Wharton, a biologist at the Desert Research Institute in Reno,\nhas found life at the bottom of perpetually frozen lakes in an area of wind-\nswept, snowless valleys.\u201d*\u00b0\nLake Hoare, situated in a mountainous region 800 miles from the South Pole, is cov-\nered by a 20-foot thick sheet of ice, the mean surface temperature of which reaches 4 below\nzero. And yet, colorful algae-like organisms manage to survive underneath the lake\u2019s icy\ncrust. As Wharton himself declared:\n\u201c[These algae-like organisms are] a fairly advanced form of life. You\u2019ve got a\ncell wall, and you\u2019ve got DNA inside the cell that is able to reproduce and\npass on information to its offspring. It\u2019s not elephants, but it\u2019s a big step in the\nevolution of biology.\u201d*\u00b0\nOr, as Chris McKay succinctly phrased it, even in permanent subfreezing conditions,\n\u201clife can persist much longer than we\u2019d thought.\u201d\u201d\u201d\nTrue, as Wharton admitted, these algae-like organisms are not elephants\u2014and a far\ncry from land plants and animals, to say nothing about humans. But, as in the case of those\ncreatures that are able to exist in total darkness, the above serves to illustrate that generalities\ncan often be deceiving.\nAn adaptation to cold is not called for in the primeval Saturnian environment we are\nattempting to reconstruct. As we have already seen in Chapter 5, even at present, Saturn radi-\nates more heat than it receives from the Sun. We saw there that, while Jupiter\u2019s excessive\nheat is accepted as a residue from the planet\u2019s formative period, most of Saturn\u2019s had been\nrelegated to kinetic energy released by the circulation of dissolved helium. But when Voy-\nager 1 flew past Saturn in late 1980, it failed to uncover such evidence. As reported by\nDennis Overbye:\n\u201cPioneer 11 had found that Saturn radiates almost three times as much energy\nas it receives from the sun. Some scientists had suggested that the helium\nmight be settling deeper inside Saturn\u2019s atmosphere than the hydrogen, re-\nleasing gravitational energy in the form of \u2018helium rain.\u2019 But this would leave\nSaturn\u2019s outer layers relatively deficient in helium, and Voyager found that\nthis was not the case.\u201d**",

While this work has\nnothing to say for or against this proposition, some of Lovelock\u2019s insights are germane to our\nsubject.\n\u201cFor example, [according to orthodoxy] we know that when the solar system\nwas formed the sun was dim and that it has heated up ever since. Yet Earth\nwasn\u2019t too cold for life in the beginning, and it isn\u2019t too hot for life now.\u201d\u201d\nWhile Lovelock gives his own reasons for this, the belief that the Sun was much\nweaker in Earth\u2019s dim past has now gained acceptance. In analyzing the problems of climate\nthought to be inherent during the Archaean era\u20143.8 to 2.5 billion years ago\u2014Gregory Jen-\nkins speaks of an environment that \u201cwas very warm with a sun that is much cooler than to-\nday\u2019s.\u201d*' Geological evidence indicates that this trend continued into the early Precambrian\nperiod during which \u201cEarth was much warmer...than it is today, despite a weaker sun.\u201d\u201d\nBillions and millions of years are far removed from the Saturnian era with which we\nare concerned. The point I wish to stress, however, is that even as per orthodox belief, life on\nEarth does not seem to have required abundant heat from the Sun. We notice, for instance,\nthat the reconstructions of primeval plants by paleobotanists, who are guided in their recon-\nstructions by fossils found in coal and other deposits, end up showing some rather tall speci-\nmens exhibiting sparse crowns of foliage. Such a study, for instance, was recently conducted\non specimens recovered from the coal seams of the American Midwest and Ohio Valley,\nwhich are believed to have been laid down by vast swamps which once stretched from Mis-\nsouri to Pennsylvania. The lycopods, forty-five to ninety feet tall,\u201d that were reconstructed\nfrom these remains have all the appearance of trees which seem to be straining their trunks in\norder to reach a feeble light, just as some plants do when grown in a dimly-lit terrarium that\nis kept in a darkened room.\u201d Thus, for instance, when the succulent popularly known as\nhens-and-chickens, which usually grows relatively flat to the ground, is grown in such a ter-\nrarium, it tends to stretch tall and spindly with its fleshy leaves growing in an open and loose\nspiral until it either reaches the light or bends and breaks under its own weight.\u201d\nAs paleobotanists from the University of Illinois who studied the remains of lycopods\nascertained: \u201cPlant life was quite different then; most plants had no seeds, and flowers had\nnot yet made their appearance.\u201d True, these trees are supposed to have thrived three",

Dated to the late Silurian and all through the Devo-\nnian periods (c. 325-280 million years ago), the first land-based plants all exhibited the same\nspindly character with sparse verdant crowns which, like the lycopod trees, give the impres-\nsion that they all had to struggle for whatever available dim light there was to nourish them.\nAnd while plant life continued to evolve and spread from the Paleozoic to the Mesozoic eras,\nfrom the Devonian through the Jurassic and end of the Cretaceous periods, they were still\nspindly specimens struggling to reach the light.* It was not until the age of mammals, pre-\ndominantly during the Paleocene period, that the land became engulfed in a verdant profu-\nsion of subtropical plants.\n\nNone of this is to say that the plants of the Quaternary era, which saw the advent of man,\nand which is, therefore, the era with which we are concerned, were anything like those of the\npre-Cambrian down to the Cretaceous. But several things need to be pointed out here, not the\nleast of which being the fact that photosynthesis works just as well under conditions other\nthan those existing in the present world. (Of photoperiodicity we will speak in a following\nchapter.) Moreover, and what is more important to our study, is that if life could have\noriginated under a dim cold Sun, to say nothing of the constant volcanic outpourings which\nare believed to have clouded the sky through most of Earth\u2019s primeval eras, it could certainly\nhave originated and thrived under a dim, but warmer, brown dwarf star. Which brings me to\nask: Has it ever occurred to anyone that the sun which bathed Earth with its radiance during\nits past geologic eras might not have been our present one?\n\nTHE PLASMASPHERE\n\nThe problem we now face is this: With Saturn stationed above Earth\u2019s north celestial\npole, and the Sun still somehow absent, how could the world have received uniform radia-\ntion? How could Earth\u2019s southern hemisphere been bathed in light and heat when it would\nhave been entirely shielded from the north-radiating brown dwarf star that was Saturn?\n\nThese are questions that have intrigued various other researchers. Prime among them,\nback in 1980, was Roger Ashton. What he finally settled upon was a shell of gas and dust, or\nbubble, within the hollow of which the Saturn-Earth system would have abided. The interior\nsurface of this shell, according to Ashton, would have reflected back Saturn\u2019s radiation to-",

At its simplest, to quote Wallace Thornhill, it \u201cis an ionized gas in which the\natoms or molecules have been stripped of their electrons, allowing both positive and negative\ncharges to move independently.\u201d There are those who deny that plasma is itself a gas, call-\ning it instead a fourth state of matter which often behaves like a gas, but which conducts\nelectricity and is affected by magnetic fields.\n\nThere was a time, not so long ago, when astrophysicists had close to no use for electric-\nity, let alone plasmas, in astronomy.

And yet, according\nto Thornhill, one characteristic of plasmas is that they tend to shield bodies embedded in\nthem by creating what is known as a Langmuir sheath around them.*\n\nBy 1997, even Talbott had jumped on this band-wagon, opting for a more extensive and\nencasing atmospheric shroud around the Saturnian system we have been reconstructing.

It is this heliosphere\u2014this \u201cbreathing bubble\u201d as it is now being called\u2014that\nacts as a \u201ccocoon\u201d which \u201callows life to flourish on earth.\u201d\nWhat all this amounts to is that Earth resides within the Sun\u2019s heliosphere, just as Ashton\nand Thornhill suppose it once resided in proto-Saturn\u2019s plasma sheath, a hypothesis that can\nno longer be dismissed as far-fetched.\nAs Thornhill explained further:\n\u201cThe astronomer [William] Herschel believed that people inhabited the Sun beneath\nits shining clouds. We now know that is a crazy idea. But would it be so crazy if the\nSun were a brown dwarf star? To a close observer, proto-Saturn would have looked\nlike a dim red star. Red giants have immense, very low density envelopes. If Betel-\ngeuse were to replace the Sun, it would encompass all of the planets out as far as Ju-\npiter! Astronomers accept the idea that planets could orbit within the thin envelope of\nsuch stars.\u201d\n\u201cAnother interesting consequence is that all objects orbiting in that region would re-\nceive the same energy per unit area of their surface. The spectrum of the light would\nhave been much redder than at present...\u201d\nTrue, as already noted, Earth\u2019s primordial star would have been feebler than our present\nSun, but this would have been compensated for by Earth\u2019s proximity to proto-Saturn which\nwould have involved a stretch that was much shorter than its present distance from the Sun,\nto say nothing of the redder spectrum of light in which it would have been bathed.\nBut could Saturn\u2019s plasmasphere have existed within the Sun\u2019s heliosphere which is itself\nnothing but a plasmasphere? Can a plasmasphere exist within another? As already noted, our\nworld itself is now being spoken of as being in a \u201cnear-Earth plasma environment.\u201d\u201d What\ndoes this mean?",

Instead, this medium was found to consist of plasma.\nBut, even then, the full implication of this discovery was not immediately understood. As\nRalph Juergens, writing in 1972, noted:\n\u201cOne of the primary characteristics of a plasma has up to now received little or no at-\ntention from astronomers. This is its ability to shield itself from the electric field of\nany body in contact with it, or contained within it, and charged to an electric potential\ndifferent from that of the plasma itself. The mechanism by which such shielding is\naccomplished was named the space-charge sheath by those who first studied the phe-\nnomenon.\u201d\u201d\nAnd:\n\u201cBy the same sort of analysis, I would conclude that the earth has a potential not quite\nin keeping with its space environment, and that it therefore is surrounded by a space\ncharge sheath. For the same reasons that a comet\u2019s sheath is elongated away from the\nsun, I would suppose that the earth\u2019s sheath has a tail; in other words, I would equate\nthe terrestrial sheath with the earth\u2019s so-called magnetosphere.\u201d\nSo, also, Wallace Thornhill who, during one of the question periods at the Society for\nInterdisciplinary Studies\u2019 Silver Jubilee in September 1999, made reference to \u201cEarth\u2019s\nwindsock-like envelope\u201d usually referred to as its \u201cmagnetotail.\u201d As he there pointed out: \u201cIn\nJuergens\u2019 view it is a plasma sheath...\u201d\nBy the turn of the century, astrophysicists themselves were speaking of plasmaspheres\naround the bodies of the Solar System as if they had always known about them. Venus, it was\ndiscovered, possessed a plasmasphere in the form of a cometary tail that spread close enough\nto \u201ctickle the Earth when the two planets are in line with the Sun.\u201d\u201d Jupiter, too, is now\nknown to be surrounded by a plasma sheet which, like the Sun\u2019s electrical current sheet, lies\nalong Jupiter\u2019s magnetic equator.\u201d So, similarly, with Saturn. As Thornhill noted, had Sat-\nurn\u2019s plasma sheath been visible in the sky, it would make the planet appear as a distinct disc\ninstead of the mere pin-point of light we see in the night sky.\u201d Eventually, Earth\u2019s own\nplasmasphere, which has been calculated to extend at least 12,000 miles into space, was even\n\u201cphotographed.\u201d",

        "content": "Like Juergens, astrophysicists originally expected Earth\u2019s plasmasphere to be elongated\nvery much like that of Venus.\u201d But when NASA\u2019s IMAGE satellite beamed back a picture of\nsunlight being scattered off the helium ions in the plasmasphere, it turned out to be circular in\nshape.\u201d Whether this was due to a misunderstood vagary, imperfect instrumentation, faulty\nreasoning, or whether it is really so remains to be seen.\n\nIt is thus obvious that plasmaspheres are contained within larger plasmaspheres since the\nplanetary plasmaspheres within our Solar System are all contained with that of the Sun.\n\nThere is therefore nothing unusual about our posited Saturnian system having been en-\ncased within a plasmasphere as hypothesized by Ashton in 1980. On the contrary, the theory\nnot only fits current astrophysical reality, it is actually demanded by it.\n\nAll of the plasmaspheres within the Solar System, however, are transparent and, as such,\nare not able to reflect radiation back toward the primary around which they are wrapped. As\nalready noted, Ashton had theorized that the plasmasphere surrounding our posited Saturnian\nsystem would have had to have been opaque. But can a plasmasphere be opaque? The answer\nis that it can. As Anthony Peratt, one of the foremost plasma physicists alive today, has\nstated, a \u201cplasma cloud...indeed can vary between transparent and opaque at different wave-\nlengths.\u201d So in that, also, we seem to be on the right track.\n\nSIXTH INTERLUDE\n\nIn the meantime, before moving to the next phase of our reconstruction, which will help\nus to unearth more of the evidence we are looking for, it behooves us to recapitulate what we\nhave learned in these last three chapters. It also allows us to expand our list of theses which,\nin keeping with the chronological sequence of events, will now have to be reshuffled and re-\nnumbered.\n\nHypothesis #1: That, from what can be deduced from ancient as well as primitive astro-\nnomical lore, Earth had once been a satellite of the planet Saturn, originally a brown dwarf\nstar, which, because of its proximity, loomed large in the sky as a distinct disc larger than the\napparent size of the full Moon.\n\nHypothesis #2: That, still according to ancient astronomical lore, during this indetermi-\nnate period, Saturn was the only visible celestial body in Earth\u2019s primordial sky.\n\nHypothesis #3: That, as seen from Earth, the Saturnian sun did not rise and/or set, but\nremained visibly immobile at all times.\n\nHypothesis #4: That Saturn\u2019s immobility was due to the fact that Earth was stationed di-\nrectly \u201cbeneath\u201d Saturn\u2019s south pole and that, from Earth, Saturn therefore appeared to be\npermanently fixed in the north celestial sphere, the very place now occupied by the Pole Star.\nWhat this also means is that Saturn and Earth were linearly aligned with the both of them\nsharing the same axis of rotation.",

This was an age which,\ndespite its remoteness in time, ended up etching itself indelibly in human consciousness. It\nwas a time during which the Sun, the Moon, and the stars were not yet visible in the sky. Sat-\nurn ruled alone.\n\nHypothesis #7: This age, we have also found out, could not have been one of total dark-\nness, and that, in fact, mankind itself remembers that the Saturnian deity actually shed a\nfeeble light. The terrestrial environment during this age was bathed in a perpetual twilight or,\nrather, a protracted dawn, which man remembered as the dawn of Creation.\n\nHypothesis #8: That, during this period, a nebulous entity, which our ancestors had diffi-\nculty in describing clearly, surrounded the Saturnian primary. We have conjectured this en-\ntity to have been a placental cloud, or circumstellar disk, surrounding the Saturnian orb. This\nentity seems to have been that to which the ancients alluded to as Chaos.\n\nHypothesis #9: During this same unspecified period, the Saturnian orb was seen to float\nover an apparition which, to ancient man, looked like water, a cosmic ocean. This \u201cwater\u201d\nwas probably the same nebular disk which, spinning slowly, would have had the appearance\nof a celestial whirlpool.\n\nHypothesis #10: That, at some later time, Saturn shone much brighter than it had previ-\nously done, bright enough for ancient man to allude to it consistently as a sun.\n\nHypothesis #11: That this primordial Saturnian sun shone during that time we today call\nthe night.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that ancient man could only describe what he had witnessed\nin the sky. Our ancient forefathers could not, however, tell what the cause of any of it was. It\nis even doubtful that they thought about it or even cared. To them, whatever it was they saw\nwas simply there. Unlike our present Sun, proto-Saturn did not rise or set. It did not move. It\njust sat there, doing nothing. It offered them no harm. It had always been there. They had al-\nways remembered it. They would have taken it for granted.\n\nThere is, however, one discordant note concerning all this. As it is now becoming in-\ncreasingly clear, there is \u201ca dearth of brown dwarfs in close orbits around Sun-like stars\u201d\u201d\n\u2014which means that the chances of our Sun having had a brown dwarf in orbit around it is\npretty slim. It therefore seems we are not yet out of the woods.",

With a dim Saturnian orb embedded within an indistinct nebulosity perpetually\nsuspended overhead, and with the Sun, the Moon, and the stars still apparently absent from\nthe sky\u2014in other words, without the succession of day and night\u2014there would have been\nnothing on which ancient man could have focused that would have enabled him to calculate\nthe passage of time. This, then, presents us with yet another opportunity to test the internal\nconsistency of the mytho-historical record because, if the above surmise is correct, our theory\ndemands that the record should have something to say about the subject. If man could not tell\ntime, he would have known nothing about it. The idea of a day, a month, or a year would\nhave meant nothing to him. The concept of time would not even have occurred to him.

Not only did he\nleave us records of a timeless era and of an age when time began, he inexorably tied it all\nwith the Saturnian deity and his planet.

In Greek this god is called by the very word time, since Kronos is the same as\nchronos, that is, time. We call him Saturnus because he saturates himself with years.\u201d\u201d\nStecchini goes on with:\n\u201cThe etymological connection of the two words Kronos and chronos has been\npositively affirmed by some linguists and strongly denied by others, because, on the\none hand, the semantic similarity of the two words is evident and, on the other, from a\ntechnical linguistic point of view, the difference between K and ch is most\nsignificant.\u201d'\u00b0\nAION\nAs for Janus himself, Lydus informs us that he was by some considered the father of\nAion and, by others, Aion\u2019s very self.''

Were it not so,\nthey might have stumbled over Kala, i.e., Chronos, as a name of Yama, i.e., Kronos,\nalias the planet Saturn.\u201d\u201d\u201d\n\nThat Time (Kala) was a name of Yama can also be learned from E. Burgess;'* that the\nHindu Yama, the same as the Persian Yima, was Saturn can be learned from Hermann Col-\nlitz.'\u00b0 So that this, also, is the same as saying that Time was another name for Saturn.\n\nBesides, leaving Chronos aside, Kronos was himself lauded as \u201cthe originator of times.\u201d\u201d\n\nKALA\n\nTo the Hindus, the \u201cWheel of Time\u201d is known as the Kala-cakra (or \u201cchakra\u201d).\u201d' Of im-\nportance to our thesis is the fact that it was Brahma, i.e. Saturn, who is said to turn this wheel\nof time.\u201d In the Svetasvatara Upanishad, it is stated that: \u201cSome wise men, deluded, speak\nof Nature, and others of Time as the cause of everything, but it is the greatness of God by\nwhich this Brahma-wheel is made to turn.\u201d\u201d Thus the same source alludes to Brahma as \u201cthe\ntime of time.\u201d The Mundaka Upanishad proclaims that the year, indeed, came from\nBrahma.\u201d What has also significant meaning is the added fact that the waters of chaos, which\nwe have previously had reason to connect with Saturn, were said to have arisen from Kala.\u201d",

If any celestial body can presently claim the right to represent\nthe year, it surely would have to be the Sun. As an indicator of the passage of time, it remains\nsupreme. Even the Moon would have been a better indicator with which to gauge the pro-\ngress of time. Moreover, our ancient forebears, living in this primeval era, would hardly have\neven noticed the planet Satur if it then appeared, like now, as nothing but a pin-point of\nlight in the night sky. More importantly, Dupuis\u2019, or Schlegel\u2019s, as also Stecchini\u2019s, exposi-\ntions do not explain what Saturn, even as Time personified, had to do with Creation. Besides,\nwhy would the slowness of the planet Saturn have led ancient man to believe in an era when\ntime was not?\n\nAs we have indicated in earlier pages, and as we shall show more fully in a sequel vol-\nume, it was the Saturnian deity who was held responsible for the Creation. But, in an Iranian\nRivayat, this role is bestowed on Time. \u201cTime is both Creator and the Lord of Creation which\nit created,\u201d it is there stated.\u201d This is paralleled by the Atharva Veda which states that \u201cTime\ncreated the earth...\u201d** A curious passage concerning Creation in a Hindu Brahmana brings\nvarious elements together:\n\n\u201cThen the seed [of Creation] became a year. Before that time there was no year.\u201d\n\nThus, despite the fact that the waters of chaos were said to have been born of Time, as we\nhave seen above, the reverse was just as true. As it was said, the waters of chaos themselves\nproduced the year, \u201cthe ordainer of the days and nights.\u201c We also have it from the Maitri\nUpanishad that \u201cthe year, verily, is Prajapati [that is Saturn, who] is Time.\u201d\n\nWhat all this intimates is that what Hindu sources term as \u201cthe year\u201d is a synonym for\n\u201ctime.\u201d This synonymy is also apparent in Hebrew where yom (or yowm), which is normally\ntaken to mean \u201cday,\u201d has the additional meaning of \u201cyear\u201d but also \u201ctime.\u201d So, similarly, in\nEgypt. The word thera, which means \u201cyear,\u201d also means \u201ctime.\u201d Thus Ptah, whom we have\nalready seen identified as Saturn, was called \u201cthe Lord of the Year,\u201d whereas Atum, his al-\nter-ego, was called \u201cthe Lord of Time.\u201d The two epithets are synonymous.",

But\nwho was this god?\nThe mythology of Dionysus presents him as a rambunctious conqueror who spread ter-\nror, as well as civilization, to the (known) world. Wherever he went, he introduced the grape\nvine and, with it, the fermentation of wine. In this respect he was similar to the Egyptian\nOsiris/Saturn who also traveled the (known) world, bringing civilization to the countries he\nvisited, as so did other Saturnian deities.\nEusebius Pamphili (c. 260-340 A. D.) already knew that the Greek Dionysus was the\nequivalent of the Egyptian Osiris. He knew about this equation from Plutarch (c. 46-120 A.\nD.)\u201d and the even earlier Herodotus who lived in the 5th century B.C.* The similarity be-\ntween Dionysus and Osiris, moreover, did not merely concern their histories as civilizers, but\neven their rites. This was so much so that Herodotus was driven to claim that the rites of Di-\nonysus could only have been borrowed by the Greeks from the Egyptians.\u201d These similari-\nties, however, are not restricted to Dionysus and Osiris, but are common to various other\nSaturnian deities. (There is also some indication that, in some quarters, Dionysus was identi-\nfied as an alter-ego of Helios\u00ae who, as we have already seen, was the original Greek name of\nthe planet Saturn.)\nThe association of time with Saturn explains why the much later festivals of the New\nYear, touched upon briefly in preceding pages, were devoted to Saturn in his many guises.\nWe should therefore not be surprised to find that among these festivals were those held in\nhonor of Dionysus, who is not only identifiable as the Saturnalian king,\u201d but also directly as\nthe Saturnian deity.\u201d It was not, therefore, spurious of William Heidel to note the obvious\nconnection of Dionysus with Aion.\u00ae As Marija Gimbutas informed her readers: \u201cIn these\nfestivals, which have assimilated elements of deep antiquity, Dionysus appears as a year-\ngod.\u201d\nQUETZALCOATL UNVEILED\nThe Aztec deity Quetzalcoatl, known to the previous Maya as Kukulkan, has been\nidentified by various authorities as different celestial, and non-celestial, entities: as the Sun;*",

Jill Abery, on the other\nhand, was not quite happy with this identification or with any of the others mentioned\nabove\u2014and rightly so. As she opined:\n\n\u201cQuetzalcoatl is a very ancient god with a multiple of aspects. As the feathered ser-\npent, readers of Velikovsky will have no difficulty in identifying him as Venus in\ncometary garb. But beyond this he is the Lord of healing, learning, beauty, creativity\nand vegetation. He was a benefactor who brought to men the use of metals and the\narts of government; who ruled in an age of perfumed, melodious plenty which can be\nregarded as the Golden Age of Mesoamerica...It would [therefore] appear that Quet-\nzalcoatl was originally the Mesoamerican equivalent of Osiris or Saturn.\u201d\n\nWould that mainstream mythologists had been as astute. Abery, of course, was not the\nfirst to ferret out the true identity of Quetzalcoatl,\u201d but I mention her especially because her\nintuition exemplifies what can be gleaned by a mind which is not constrained by orthodox\nviews.\n\nWhat has confused the issue, and many a mythologist, is the Mesoamerican belief that\nwhen Quetzalcoatl died, his heart flew up and turned into the Morning Star,\u00ae which star has\nbeen usually understood as Venus when it appears in the morning\u00ae\u2014an event that, as we\nhave seen on an earlier page, is duplicated in the mythology of the Egyptian Osiris/Saturn.\nWhat mythologists and archaeoastronomers seem to forget is that it was the heart of\nQuetzalcoatl, and not Quetzalcoatl himself, which turned into the Morning Star. Quetzalcoatl\nand the Morning Star were thus two entirely different entities.\n\nLet me now state that nowhere in Mesoamerican lore is Quetzalcoatl identified as Saturn.\nIf this identification is to hold, it must do so on the evidence offered by comparative\nmythology.\n\nLike the Saturnian deity of other nations, Quetzalcoatl was considered as the creator.\u201d\nLike the Saturnian deity of other nations, as Abery indicated, Quetzalcoatl was also a\ncivilizer.\u201d As in the Saturnian myths of other nations, Quetzalcoatl was the original one and\nonly god.

One could conjecture that the stars might have been rendered\ninvisible by the radiance, no matter how dim, emanating from the Saturnian sun. But,\nwhile true, we do not need to rely solely on that. If, as hypothesized, the Saturnian plasma-\nsphere was really opaque, it would have been enough to shield the stars from view. The\nMoon, I simply claim, was not yet in orbit around Earth.! As for the Sun, there is no way that\nSaturn\u2019s dim light could have blotted out its radiance. The question then revolves on the\nclaimed opacity of the plasmasphere. Was the plasmasphere opaque enough to blot out the\nSun\u2019s illumination?\nUnfortunately, as of this writing, not enough is known about planetary plasmaspheres to\nreadily answer that question. As the plasma physicist Anthony Peratt informed me, \u201cthis is\nnot a back of the envelope calculation,\u201d which would probably \u201cgive you the wrong answer\nanyway.\u201d What is required is a \u201cfull magnetohydrodynamic simulation with radiation trans-\nport,\u201d which would take \u201cseveral weeks once the problem was set up.\u201d Despite all that, Peratt\nwas kind enough to supply me with a \u201ctop-of-the-head-opinion.\u201d While the scientific verdict\nis not yet in, Peratt\u2019s scholarly intuition is that \u201cit would be extremely difficult for a planetary\nplasmasphere to become opaque enough to entirely blot out the sun.\u201d?\nThus, together with other evidence which I shall soon be supplying, the conclusion has\nbeen reached that, during the Saturnian age of darkness, the Sun was not merely hidden, that\nis obscured. Like the Moon, it was actually absent. Which raises the question: Where could it\nhave been?\nTo be sure, the Sun was always here. Only we were not.\nAs far fetched as it might at first appear, what I am about to propose is that the Saturnian\nsystem, including Earth and its inhabitants, was originally exterior to the Solar family of\nplanets and that, having spent long ages traveling alone in the darkness of space, it eventually\ninvaded the Sun\u2019s domain to become a permanent member of the present planetary order. I\nrealize that, by now, I have taken the reader with me into water that reaches well above our\nheads. We had better then start swimming \u2014but let us take it one stroke at a time.\nThe concept that Earth had originally been exterior to the Solar System can be traced to\nthe Cartesian naturalist Benoit de Maillet (1656-1738). Basing his belief on ancient tradi-\ntions, including the Book of Genesis, de Maillet reasoned that the primordial Earth had re-\nvolved around a sun that was much smaller than the present one up until the time of the Bib-\nlical Deluge. In his scheme, Earth then left its original sun and invaded the Solar System as a\nCO: question that still needs to be answered is: What hid the Sun, the Moon, and the",

As he wrote in 1950:\n\u201cThe solar system is not a structure that has remained unchanged for billions of\nyears...Nor is there justification for the excuse that man cannot know or find out how\nthis system came into being because he was not there when it was arranged in its pre-\nsent pattern...The Earth has come in [near-]contact with other planets and com-\nets...Also, some dark star, like Jupiter or Saturn, may be in the path of the sun, and\nmay be attracted to the system and cause havoc in it.\u201d4\nAs apostate as Velikovsky might have been, the idea of an interloper into the Solar Sys-\ntem is not exactly adverse to mainstream astronomy. Thus, for instance, in 1962, R. L. For-\nward expressed the opinion that Pluto was an alien that had settled among the solar family.\n\u201cApparently Pluto is a stranger which arrived in its present orbit from the regions of\nspace...It is as if Pluto had come along, interacted with Neptune, and pushed it into\nan inner orbit.\u201d>\nJohn Weir has even sought to account for the apparent deviations between the present\nmotions of Venus and those recorded in the Babylonian Ninsianna Tablets (also known as the\nTablets of Ammizaduqa) by postulating the capture of \u201ca relatively large body\u201d by the Solar\nSystem, which body \u201cmight have broken up and been \u2018captured\u2019 by Jupiter.\u201d6\nThis is highly interesting because the invasion of such a body would have had to have\ntranspired during historical times as opposed to the millions of years into the past to which\nastronomers usually relegate such occurrences. It also proves that speculative events dictated\nby the contents of ancient historical documents are not outside the domain of conventional\nastronomers.\nDilettantes, including Biblical fundamentalists, have also involved themselves in similar\nhypothesizing. Donald Patten, with whom this writer disagrees on too many issues, is also of\nthe belief that Earth was once extraneous to the Sun\u2019s domain. As he wrote in 1967:\n\u201cHeliogenesis must be discarded in favor of Galactogenesis. Galactogenesis implies\nthat our planet Earth, and its satellite, the Moon, have both spent ample astronomical\ntime both beyond our solar system as well as within it. Hence...a catastrophic time\ntable must include both pre-solar time (galactic time) and intra-solar time (time spent\nwithin the Sun\u2019s domain).\u201d7",

According to these two writers, the\nentire planets of the present solar family had once belonged to an extraneous system gov-\nered by a dark star, the binary partner of the Sun, which they referred to as Planet X.8 In this\nscenario, the Planet X system would, from time to time, have approached closer to the Sun\nwhere, with each close approach, the latter slowly stripped Planet X of its brood of planets, a\nfew at a time.\nPatten and Windsor did not have the mytho-historical record in mind when they con-\nstructed their scenario. Theirs was actually an attempt to disprove the nebular hypothesis\nusually attributed to Immanuel Kant and supplant it with what Patten and Windsor believed\nto be a more viable history of the formation of the Solar System.? They did not even seem to\nrealize that Kant\u2019s nebular hypothesis had already been discarded at the time they proposed\ntheir theory. Thus, their various objections to Kant\u2019s nebular hypothesis are entirely\nsuperfluous. Besides, it did not even dawn on them that their version of the formation of the\nSolar System begged the question of how the Planet X system itself originated. On that score,\nif on no other, their scenario is as redundant as their objections.\nWorst of all, the detailed step by step description of the manner in which this planetary\ntransfer too place, with precise orbital and rotational periods, values of eccentricity, closeness\nof approach, etcetera and so forth, both before and after capture, often given to many places\nof decimal, makes one think that the authors had actually been there at the time with a load of\nscientific instruments to record it all for posterity.!\u00b0 Theirs is not a methodology that inspires\nconfidence, let alone credence.\nActually, it was Ralph Juergens who set us on the right path. Back in 1977, basing his\nscenario on what little Velikovsky had yet published about the subject of Saturn, he was\nbold enough to climb out on what was then still considered something of a slim limb. As\nhe wrote:\n\u201c...some points of...discussion may emerge from a consideration of Velikovsky\u2019s as\nyet unpublished evidence that Saturn was once a star and in all likelihood the Earth\u2019s\n\u201cSun\u2019 at one time...\n\u201cVelikovsky has stated that Satum was disrupted in a near-collision with Jupiter.\nKnowing little or nothing of the details, I can most easily imagine such an encounter\nin terms of a Saturnian planetary system, which included the Earth, being invaded,\ndismembered, and captured by an interloping system of relative giants consisting es-\nsentially of the present Sun and Jupiter... 1!\nOut in space, this would be the same as having the Saturnian system invading the Solar\none, as per our present supposition. On the other hand, in this work, I have nothing to offer\nconcerning the disruption of Saturn through a collision with Jupiter. Nevertheless, the\nhypothesis that Saturn and Earth had once constituted a planetary system that was exterior to\nours fits our unfolding scenario to the proverbial Tee.",

A few are trinities or orbit each other in\ngroups of four or more. Still fewer go it alone. The Sun appears to be a loner. In re-\ncent years it has been postulated that the Sun, after all, may have its partner too,\nwhich would necessarily be a very small star, not seen as yet by astronomers. Neme-\nsis [as this solar companion has been dubbed] is posited to be in an extremely ellipti-\ncal orbit, approaching the Sun every 26 million years...\n\u201cA stronger likelihood, perhaps, is that Nemesis does not exist and will not be found.\nNemesis would now be near its aphelion and, over an incredibly long moment arm,\nshould exert a detectable tug on the Sun. No news is no news. But another possibility\nis also worth considering. If in the past there was a Nemesis and it is no longer out\nthere, it may actually be here. Two stars in a binary system each may have a quota of\nterrestrial bodies and gas giant planets. If their orbital relationship is highly elliptical,\nboth systems could suffer drastic changes at each close approach. The much smaller\nstar would be subject to close encounters with gas giant satellites of the much larger\nstar, involving a possible loss of considerable angular momentum and mass. Hence, it\nis possible that a former Nemesis is now part of our Solar System.\n\u201cIn the event of such a catastrophic event such a \u2018star\u2019 could also lose its ability to\ngenerate stellar amounts of heat and light and could be captured as a close-in gas gi-\nant satellite of the larger star...If it is ultimately decided that Earth did arrive into the\nSolar System as a satellite of a Nemesis-like sun/planet\u2014perhaps Jupiter or Sat-\nurn\u2014then numerous geological mysteries would be cleared up and man\u2019s early pre-\noccupation with planetary worship would be much easier to understand.\u201d !2\nEven more recently, the invasion of the Solar system by the Saturnian one, including\nEarth, has been taken up and expounded further by Wallace Thornhill. 3\nAstronomers have not yet postulated that Earth may have originated outside our Sun\u2019s\ndomain. But, in view of their recently revised history of the Solar Systems, as will be\noutlined below, even they are now asking whether Earth has always been where it is now.14\nSo where could it have been?\nEXTRA-SOLAR PLANETS\nWhen, in the 1980s, Carl Sagan aired his belief, earlier adhered to by Giordano Bruno,\nthat the universe is filled with planets orbiting stars other than our own Sun, he was laughed\nout of court.

Thus, in explaining what he termed \u201cthe general plan of planetary systems,\u201d he\nalready could refer to \u201csuper [JJovian planets, which are known to accompany some stars.\u201d !\nDespite more recent reports to the contrary, the first of these extra-solar planets was dis-\ncovered by D. Reuyl in 1936. With an estimated mass of 0.04 M, and an orbital period of 15\nyears, it was detected near the star known as Ross 614.17\nAnother planet already known to Firsoff is one \u201ca little less than twice as massive as Ju-\npiter,\u201d which orbits Proxima Centauri, 4.3 light years away. '8\nThese planets, it should be pointed out, are detected rather than observed. Stars which are\naccompanied by planets go through periodic wobbles which are ascertained through the\nDoppler shifts in their spectral lines, due to the attraction of their invisible attendants. The\namount of wobble allows the accompanying planet\u2019s mass and orbit to be calculated.\nAs Firsoff reported:\n\u201cSeveral other stars are known to have dark companions, but these are rather more\nmassive than Proxima\u2019s big planet. Such superplanets may be partly degenerate, with\ninteriors in superdense conditions encountered in White Dwarfs, and so could be\nquite small, despite their great masses.\u201d!9\nAnother body, which Firsoff referred to as \u201ca dark companion of about 10 times the mass\nof Jupiter,\u201d was also detected orbiting the red dwarf star Lalande 21185, which is calculated\nto be 8.1 (or 8.25 as newer sources have it) light years away and said to have a mass of 0.4\nM. As Firsoff adds: \u201cThis discovery was due to the exceptionally large proper motion of the\nstar, which changes its position in the sky by 4.8\" a year and, for this reason, was being\nclosely followed.\u201d 2\u00b0\nFirsoff did not enumerate the discoveries and identities of the extra-solar planets known\nin 1967 one by one, but he did state that \u201cnearly 10 superplanets are now known to be at-\ntached to the nearest stars.\u201d2! Thus, even then, Firsoff could claim that:\n\u201cFar from being exceptional, the Solar System is rather a humdrum example of\nplanetary configurations. There are multiple stars, each with an array of planets of its\nown; close binaries sharing one or more planets; superplanets that may have planetary\nsatellites, which may in turn be accompanied by moons.\u201d22\nAstronomers are not always honest. Take, for instance, the planet supposedly discovered\nby Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz in orbit around the star 51 Pegasi at a distance of 50\nlight years. More recently touted as the first such planet detected, Sam Flamsteed even spoke",

What, then, of the 10 extra-solar\n\nplanets that were already known by 1967, the first of which was discovered in 1936?\nSo, similarly, with the planet\u2014or, at least, a brown dwarf star\u2014said to orbit Proxima\nCentauri, which has recently been said to have first been discovered in 1998 through the\nHubble Space Telescope.24 How, then, could Firsoff have written about it in 1967?\nBut then, David Golimowski and Dan Schroeder nixed the whole thing. More sensitive\nobservations led these two observers to conclude that no evidence really existed for such \u201ca\nbrown dwarf or planet companion.\u201d As Golimowski stated:\n\u201cWe have images of Proxima that definitely should have revealed something. They\ndid not.\u201d25\nEven so, as of this writing, planets in extra-solar systems are being detected almost every\nmonth. These assemblages, however, bear little resemblance to our own Solar System. Cal-\nculated to be half the mass of Jupiter, the 51 Pegasi planet orbits its primary at a mere dis-\ntance of 5 million miles, which is seven times closer than tiny Mercury orbits our Sun. The\nplanet completes its orbit in a mere 4.2 days.26\n\u201cTo appreciate how bizarre this behavior is,\u201d writes Flamsteed, \u201cit helps to consider\nthe bigger planets in our solar system\u2014Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They\nare all at least a hundred times farther from the sun than 51 Peg[asi]\u2019s planet appears\nto be. And it takes them years\u2014a full dozen years, in the case of Jupiter\u2014to make a\nsingle orbit.\u201d27\nWhat, then, of the belief that giant gas planets can only form somewhere in the middle of\nthe revolving cloud of collapsing interstellar gas and dust that goes into forming a solar sys-\ntem? By the 1990s, astronomers had to ask: \u201cHow could a giant planet form so close to a star\nwithout being sucked in by gravity?\u201d8\nActually Doug Lin had already suggested that planets like Jupiter could migrate from an\nouter system in toward their parent star. Lin\u2019s hypothesis, however, did not envisage such\ngiant planets ever coming to a halt close to their primary. His theory demanded that such\nplanets would eventually be swallowed up by their sun. But, in view of newer discoveries,\nLin and fellow astronomers were soon writing in Nature with two different scenarios aimed\nat getting a Jupiter-sized planet to stop short of being swallowed up.29\nAnd then\u2014the see-saw of scientific opinion\u2014David Gray announced that the posited\nplanet around 51 Pegasi was not really there at all.3\u00b0 Most astronomers, however, have disre-\ngarded his conclusion, and the posited planet has now become fact.\nIn the twelve months following this discovery and its attempted debunking, six other ex-\ntra-solar planets were announced as having been detected. Three of them were said to be Ju-\npiter-sized bodies orbiting \u201cabsurdly close\u201d to their primaries. Two others were found to orbit",

This planet has been calculated to have\na mass equivalent to 3.87 that of Jupiter. It orbits its primary in a circular path in 3.3 days. It\nis 6.9 million kilometers (0.046 astronomical units) from its sun.33 This places it closer to its\nprimary than Earth is to our Sun.\n\nThe planet orbiting Lalande 21185, concerning which Firsoff had written in 1967, is even\ncloser to us\u2014now calculated as 8.25 light-years away. It is now believed that this star is or-\nbited by at least two planets. One of these is said to be the size of Jupiter at a distance\nequivalent to Saturn\u2019s distance from our Sun. The other planet, only slightly less massive\nthan Jupiter, is believed to orbit Lalande at about the distance of the asteroid belt.34\n\nThe binary star system CM Draconis, 50 light-years away, is also believed to be orbited\nby a planet with a diameter equal to 85 percent that of Jupiter.

In 1996, through the use of the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers noticed that\nthe disk of dust around the star Beta Pictoris seemed to be tilted. They could only think of\ntwo possible ways in which this stellar disk could have been unbalanced: it was either due to\nradiation from the star itself or the existence of a large planet which would have tugged at the\ndebris in the disk. Two years later, Sally Heap, then of NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Cen-\nter, trained Hubble\u2019s Imaging Spectrograph on Beta Pictoris to obtain closer views of the star\nand its disk. Her verdict was that the images she was able to resolve strongly suggested a\nplanet or planets.3\u00b0 She did, however, warn that: \u201cBecause the star is shrouded in dust, it will\nbe impossible to ever see any planets around Beta Pic., so I don\u2019t know how we will get a\ndirect confirmation.\u201d3\u201d\n\nAnother extra-solar planet, calculated to be 6.84 times the mass of Jupiter, has been de-\ntected orbiting the star 70 Virginis at a mere distance of 0.47 astronomical units in an orbital\nperiod of 116.7 days.38 It was unmasked by the team of Geoffrey Marcy and Paul Butler,\u00b0\nwho have found \u201cmore planets than anyone else in history.\u201d40 Six of these planets, brought to\nlight by 1998, were featured in Astronomy; five others were reported by early 1999, two of\nwhich have been calculated to be 5 times the mass of Jupiter.4?\n\nIn the year 2000 came news of the possible discovery of extra-solar planets which ap-\npeared to measure a mere 2.5 Earth radii.

Gorkavyi\u2019s method involves a search for \u201cwhorls and clumps\nproduced by a planet\u2019s gravitational meddling.\u201d This method rewarded him with three new\nplanets, including one that is said to be only 0.2 times the mass of Jupiter, revolving around\nEpsilon Eridani, 5.5 billion miles away, which would make it about twice the distance our\nown Neptune orbits from the Sun.45\nAn even smaller planet, weighing in at about 0.15 Jupiter\u2019s mass\u2014which makes it about\nhalf Saturn\u2019s mass\u2014has been detected circling the star HD 83443. This one has a second\nSaturn-sized planet which, as Svitil reported, \u201cbolsters the view that groupings like our solar\nsystem are not uncommon.\u201d 4\nIn January of 2001, the extra-solar planet-hunting team lead by Geoffrey Marcy an-\nnounced the detection of \u201ca pair of planets, each about the mass of Jupiter, that whirl around\ntheir home star [Gliese 876], 15 light-years from Earth in perfect lock-step.\u201d One of these\nplanets takes 30 days to complete its orbit, the other \u201cexactly\u201d twice as long\u2014that is in a\ntwo-to-one ratio.47\nAlso announced by Marcy and his team is a solar system, dominated by the star HD\n168443, at a distance of 123 light-years in the constellation Serpens. This system harbors a\n7.7 to 15 Jupiter-mass planet accompanied by another body that has been calculated to be\nfrom 17 to 40 times as massive as Jupiter. A body that massive had astronomers scratching\ntheir heads since they could not \u201cquite figure what it can be.\u201d As Marcy himself noted: \u201cIt\u2019s\na bit frightening.\u201d \u00ae\n\u201cWhat\u2019s frightening,\u201d reports Michael Lemonick, \u201cis that these discoveries make it clear\nhow little astronomers know about planets...\u201d49 Or, as Princeton astronomer Scott Tremaine\nput it: \u201cNot a single prediction for what we\u2019d find in other systems has turned out to be cor-\nrect.\u201d50\nAs of this writing, the number of extra-solar planets that have been detected orbiting\nother stars had risen to 55.5! The problem caused by all these discoveries was succinctly\nstated by Flamsteed when he wrote that:\n\u201cAfter decades of searching, we\u2019ve finally found other planets orbiting other stars,\nand found them in abundance. Now the only problem is figuring out how on Earth to\nexplain them.\u201d 52",

        "content": "\nTHE REVISED HISTORY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nThe discovery of dominant massive planets in extra-solar systems forced astronomers to\nrevise their theories concerning the formation of solar systems in general. Assigning the\nproblem to computers, simulations conducted by Frederic Rasio and Eric Ford resulted in\nmodels that were catastrophic enough to warm the hearts of Velikovskians.\n\u201cTn a system containing two Jupiter-like planets, the possibility exists that a dynami-\ncal instability will develop. Computer simulations suggest that in many cases this in-\nstability leads to the ejection of one planet while the other is left in a smaller, eccen-\ntric, orbit. In extreme cases, the eccentric orbit has a small enough periastron distance\nthat it may circularize at an orbital period as short as a few days through tidal dissipa-\ntion. This may explain the recently detected Jupiter-mass planets in very tight circular\norbits and wider eccentric orbits around nearby stars.\u201d\nIn turn, this led to new theories concerning the formation of our own Solar System. As\nJosie Glausiusz commented:\n\u201c...the detection of extra-solar planets has forced astronomers to re-examine [the the-\nory concerning the formation of our Solar System] because [these planets] present us\nwith a paradox. Many are so monstrous in size, and hug their stars so closely, that\nthey could not have formed in their present positions. The searingly hot stars around\nwhich they circle would have melted their rocky cores before they got started. In-\nstead, it\u2019s assumed that they coalesced some distance away, then barreled inward over\nmillions of years. And if such chaos characterizes the birth of extra-solar planets,\ncould not similar disorder have reigned closer to home?\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what astronomers are proposing. Instead of staid and steady motion\nfrom the start, they see turmoil. During the early years of our solar system, they say,\ngiant planets were born, bounced about, swung past one another, and were flung\napart before settling into their present orbits. [It is now suggested] that the massive\nicy planets Uranus and Neptune formed in close proximity to gassy Jupiter and Sat-\nurn, then barged past the behemoths into the far reaches of the solar system...\n\u201c[It is now suggested] that the emergence of a Jupiter-sized planet during the early\nyears of a solar system can trigger chaos, birthing punier planets, then ejecting them\nin all directions.\u201d\nEven newer theories suggest that an alien star could easily pass by the Solar System and\nthat this could alter Jupiter\u2019s orbit which could then pass so close to Earth that our world\ncould easily be ejected into space or crash into the Sun.\u00b0>\nIn fact, other theorists are now proposing that the early Solar System might have con-\ntained up to twenty planets in irregular orbits \u201cwhere they were eventually bound to col-\nlide.\u201d56",

G. Hills in 1969 in\nwhich it was \u201csuggested that the three outermost planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, were\ndisplaced into their present orbit by encounters with other planets.\u201d Described by C. J.\nRansom as a consequence of Hill\u2019s analysis of the solar nebula, this theory concluded that\n\u201cSaturn was initially the outermost planet to form in the nebula.\u201d 8\nOnce unheard of, it is no longer possible to maintain that our Solar System has remained\nunchanged since its formation. Granted that astronomers are still keeping such events at\narm\u2019s length by insisting that orbital changes within our System could only have transpired\nmillions of years ago, we have reason to believe that some of these changes took place during\nthe era of mankind. And, as we shall soon see, we are not alone in this belief.\nA MATTER OF NOMENCLATURE\nBeginning around October 2000, news began circulating that more than half of the so-\ncalled extra-solar planets that had been discovered up to then were not planets at all but,\nrather, brown dwarf stars, double stars, or low-mass stars.59 The reasons for this change of\nmind were variously given by various authorities. It was, for instance, reported that the radial\nvelocity techniques behind the discoveries were inadequate to determine the angle of obser-\nvation which would affect the results concerning the masses involved. As announced by the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\u2019s Allegheny Observatory: \u201cRadial velocity observations cannot dis-\ntinguish between a planet in an orbit that is viewed nearly edge on from a brown dwarf or\nstellar companion in an orbit that is nearly in the plane of the sky.\u201d\nUsing astrometric data from the European Space Agency, as well as astral velocity data,\nastrophysicists from the United States and Korea have determined that the orbital inclinations\nof the objects in question are extremely low. In other words, \u201cthe orbital planes of these\ncompanions appear to be oriented nearly face on to the observer.\u201d6! According to David\nBlack of the Lunar and Planetary Institute: \u201cThis contradicts the assumption that the line-of-\nsight angle is random in the radial velocity studies.\u201d\u00ae Putting it plainly, randomness dictates\nthat some of these objects should be seen edge-on, while others face-on as viewed from our\nangle here on Earth.\nAccording to George Gatewood of the Allegheny Observatory:\n\u201cPart of the problem arises because masses smaller than that of Jupiter are very diffi-\ncult to detect [outside the Solar System], thus most of the objects that have been de-\ntected and are suspected to be planets have masses greater than that of Jupiter, the\nmost massive planet in our solar system. Until very recently, there were few known\nobjects between one Jupiter in mass and 80 times as much, and those are all small\nstars.\u201d63",

As Geoffrey Marcy has been reported to have\nstated: \u201cThe claim by David Black is completely incorrect.\u201d Having risen to fame as one of\nthe most successful of extra-solar planet-hunters, Marcy had something to lose if Black was\ncorrect. On the other hand, Marcy had a good argument. As he and others have pointed out,\nfour of the companions which Black and his team had investigated are said to orbit their pri-\nmaries \u201cwithin one degree of perfect alignment with the line of sight.\u201d65\n\u201cYet the chance of any single partner of a given mass having that orientation is about\n1 in 5,000. Conversely, for every partner with that orientation, there should be 5,000\nor so with less extreme orientation. No such bodies are seen. Marcy is so convinced\nthat he says Scientific American \u2018will be doing science a bum steer\u2019 simply by men-\ntioning Black\u2019s work.\u201d\nBut then, Tsevi Mazeh and Shay Zucker weighed in from Tel Aviv University with the\nsuggestion that \u201cthe truth lies somewhere in the middle.\u201d Concerning the four companions\ninvestigated by Black, they claim that two of them do indeed \u201chave the heft of a star.\u201d The\nother two, according to them, do not.\u00ae7\nOthers suspect that the analyses \u201chave fallen prey to subtle computational biases,\u201d and\nthat \u201cit is quite plausible that searchers have unwittingly skewed their sample,\u201d and that\nhigher precision astrometry as well as other methods are needed to resolve the debate.\nEventually, even Marcy was forced to give an inch when the then newly discovered outer\ncompanion to yet another star was estimated to be \u201cbetween 17 and 40 times\u201d the mass of\nJupiter.

Anything over that is to be termed a brown dwarf star.\u201d Others decided that objects\nless than 13 times the mass of Jupiter should be classified as planets, while those between 13\nand 75 Jupiter masses should be termed brown dwarf stars.\u201d In other words, the dilemma\nwas temporarily, and arbitrarily, alleviated by invoking nomenclature.",

By then, they were not even sure what a planet really was, let alone red and brown\ndwarf stars. Alan Stern and Harold Levison attempted to come up with a new criteria, but this\ndid not help much since it was still reliant on mass. Thus, according to them, a planet has to\nbe a body \u201clow enough in mass that at no time, past or present, can it generate energy in its\ninterior due to any self-sustaining fusion reaction.\u201d74 But, as Adam Burrows pointed out:\n\u201cThere is an unfounded prejudice that a planet should not have a thermonuclear phase,\u201d and\nthat this was merely a preconception that might not be verified by observable facts.75\n\nAs far as our thesis is concerned, it does not much matter whether these so-called extra-\nsolar planets are really planets, brown dwarf stars, or some of each, since our scenario ac-\ncounts for both a planet (Earth) and a brown dwarf star (Saturn) as having been partners\noutside the Solar System.\n\nTHE RUNAWAY PLANET\n\nExtra-solar planets were not only found orbiting stars, but even escaping from them. At\nleast one such planet was said to have been discovered streaming away from the double star\nsystem known as TMR-1, 450 light-years from Earth, with a separation between them of 3.7\nbillion miles. Moreover, this one was actually visible through the Hubble Space telescope\nand has been photographed. Discovered by Susan Terebey, the planet was calculated to be\n\u201ctwo to three times Jupiter\u2019s mass, flung off in a gravitational tug-of-war between the [two]\nstars.\u201d The planet was said to be racing away at a speed of 20,000 miles an hour.7\u00b0\n\nUnfortunately, this discovery was eventually questioned. The pertinent planet was later\nexplained as nothing more than a background star. This was \u201cdeduced\u201d from the spectrum of\nthe object in question which (a) showed no signs of water vapor, and (b) appears to be too\nhot, at 2,700\u00b0 Kelvin (4,400\u00b0 F), to be a protoplanet?\u2019\u2014even though, personally, I am not\nquite sure why these parameters should rule out a protoplanet.\n\nEven so, Terebey herself has not entirely ruled out her original assumption. As a report\nby her reads: \u201cAt this time there is no strong evidence that TMR-IC itself is a protoplanet.\u201d78\nBut she added:\n\n\u201cThe models are not yet reliable at such young ages, so this test by itself is not con-\nclusive. The idea remains alive and well that there may be runaway planets and\nbrown dwarfs...which formed via ejection from multiple star systems.\u201d\n\nEight months later, Scientific American republished the photograph of TMR-1C with a\ncaption referring to it as a \u201cpossible\u201d protoplanet \u201changing on\u201d to the star.\u00ae\u00b0 And there, at the\ntime of this writing, the matter rested.\n\nAgain, to us, it does not matter whether TMR-1IC is truly an escaped planet. What con-\ncerns us is that it was originally accepted as such, which means that planets escaping from\ntheir systems are in the realm of possibility. Even Phil Lucas, as we shall soon see, would not",

Using spectrometers, which measure visible and invisible energy alike,\nZapatero-Osorio\u2019s team \u201cactually saw the objects they describe.\u201d\u00ae\u00b0\n\nAs with Phil Lucas, and despite her belief that these bodies would have had to have been\nformed independently, Zapatero-Osorio did not rule out the possibility that they may have\nbeen ejected from other systems containing stars around which they would have originally\norbited.%\n\nThe eighteen lone travelers through space soon rose to twenty five; and the theorized ex-\nistence of hundreds of others soon rose to hundreds of millions of footloose planets wander-\ning through the Milky Way.?!\n\nWhat is perhaps more important to our own study, however, is Firsoff's conclusion in re-\nlation to these lonesome planets. \u201cIn the absence of the ionising radiation of the star,\u201d he\nwrote, \u201c[such planets] should be able to retain more extensive atmospheres, and, while ter-\nrestrial planets of this kind would be very cold, large [JJovian or sub-[J]ovian masses may\nhave enough internal heat to allow any type of life, even based on our carbohydrate chemis-\ntry, to develop on their surfaces.\u201d92\n\nAlthough we shall probably never know whether Saturn and Earth are bodies that escaped\nfrom another solar system, we have seen that such liberated planets are considered to be\nwithin the realm of possibility. Planets traveling alone through space have now become quite\ncommon. There is, therefore, nothing impossible about Earth having traveled together with\nSaturn through the cold realms of space before they came within the grips of our present Sun.\n\nAs Firsoff admitted, Jovian and even sub-Jovian masses may retain enough internal heat\nto allow life to develop and sustain itself. Our own hypothesis differs only slightly from this\nin that it was Saturn\u2019s heat which allowed the existence of life on Earth. True, Saturn is less\nmassive than Jupiter and, at its present mass, falls short of the requirements for it to be con-\nsidered a brown dwarf star since, as we have seen, such stars have masses ranging from about\n15 to 80 times that of Jupiter.\u00b0? However, it has been ascertained that \u201cbrown dwarfs bridge\nthe entire gap between stars and planets,\u201d with low-mass candidates being more numerous\nthan high-mass ones, \u201cand this trend continues down nearly to planetary masses.\u201d It has\neven been conjectured that \u201cthe masses of brown dwarfs and planets can actually overlap\neach other!\u201d95 Besides, as I intend to show in the proposed sequel to this volume, there is\nreason to believe that, as a brown dwarf star, proto-Saturn was once more massive.\n\nIt is now believed that there are twice as many brown dwarfs as there are \u201creal\u201d stars.\u00b0\u00b0\nMoreover, it has been found out that \u201cfar more brown dwarfs float freely than orbit stars.\u201d97\nIt has additionally been conjectured that one of them \u201cmight even be stirring up the Oort",

Of\nsolar systems and brown dwarf stars\u2014even of planets, per se\u2014he knew nothing. All that he\ncould later recollect was that the Sun had been absent during the earliest times he could re-\nmember. I believe we have supplied enough of man\u2019s ancient memory concerning that period\nin previous pages. Here I will merely add two snippets concerning Raven, Raven Boy, and\nWanadi, simply because we had already had something different to relate concerning these\nmythological entities.\nThus, among the Eskimos it is told how Raven Boy absconded with the sun but that, at\nhis father Raven\u2019s behest, he \u201cset the sun back in its old place so that light once more re-\nturned to the earth.\u201d\n\u201cBut it was not the unremitting light of former days, for Raven Boy feared that if the\npeople forgot the terrors of darkness, they would forget also Raven\u2019s teaching. With a\nsweep of a wing, he sent the sky spinning round the earth, carrying the sun with it and\nin this way day and night were created.\u201d!00\nWhat this tells us is that the sun which Raven Boy absconded with was one that shed an\n\u201cunremitting light,\u201d which hints at a sun that neither rose nor set. This, then, would have al-\nluded to the immobile Saturnian sun. The sun he set back in place, on the other hand, was\none that went \u201cround the earth\u201d \u2014in other words, our present Sun.\nThe Makiritare of Venezuela, whom we have also met on a previous page, revered Wa-\nnadi as he \u201cwho shines in the highest heaven.\u201d !\u00b0! But since, as we have already seen, this\nWanadi was said to have been \u201clike a sun that never sets,\u201d !\u00b02 we have every reason to believe\nthat the reference is to the once immobile Saturnian sun. The light from this Wanadi was said\nto have eventually failed from coming down anymore. And that is why, the Makiritare say,\n\u201cthe new Wanadi made this sun for us, to make it light for us during the day.\u201d And: \u201cWhen\nthe new Wanadi came, it dawned again.\u201d 13",

Does primitive man remember anything of the sort?\nRecords of the slowly approaching Sun are somewhat rare. But then there is another point\nto consider. In view of the immobile Saturnian sun which shone perpetually above him,\nwould prehistoric man have really paid much attention to a slowly growing pin-point of light\nin the sky? And, of those that did, how many might have forgotten what to them would have\nseemed an unobtrusive circumstance? As Thornhill rightly claimed, \u201cthe [Saturnian] celestial\neffects as viewed from Earth would have been so dramatic that it seems to have completely\novershadowed even the growing appearance of the Sun as this loomed closer.\u201d!07\nAnd yet, the Okanagan Indians seem to have retained just such a memory when they\nspeak of that time, \u201clong, long ago, when the sun was young and no bigger than a star...\u201d 18\nFor the first time in the history of mankind, a light other than Saturn\u2019s managed to shine\nthrough the night of nights.\nThe Ipurinas of the Upper Amazon not only preserved a similar record of the Sun\u2019s origi-\nnal small size but also of its growing larger as Earth drew nearer.\n\u201cThe \u2018sun\u2019 they tell...was originally very small, hardly \u2018a nail\u2019s breadth\u2019 across. But\none day it suddenly began to grow till it was \u2018a span\u2019 across. Then the waters began to\ntise and overflowed the world.\u201d!\nrise and overflowed the world.\u201d!\nA similar belief concerning the subject at hand is also to be found among the Sia of New\nMexico which, like that of the Ipurinas, also adds some interesting aspects of its own. As it is\nrelated by these people:\n\u201cWhen the sun was far off, his face was blue; as he came nearer, the face grew\nbrighter. Yet they did not see the sun himself, but only a large mask which covered\nhis whole body.\u201d !!\u00a9\nThe main interesting point behind this ancient conviction is that the Sun was not merely\nremembered as having been smaller in size, or that it grew in size, but that it had actually\nonce been \u201cfar off.\u201d It also correctly presents the view that the Sun \u201cgrew brighter\u201d\nas it came nearer which, logical as this would be, is not mentioned in the other records we\nhave examined. The other additional point it mentions is that, when the Sun was still much\nfarther away, its face was blue. What this might relate to will be explained in the proposed\nsequel to this work.\nIn the meantime, and in order to forestall an objection, let us again look at our hypothesis\nfrom an astronomical point of view.

It was reasoned\nthat, if the Sun had first appeared \u201cno bigger than a star,\u201d it would have taken more than the\nentire length of man\u2019s sojourn on Earth for it to come close enough to appear of the size of\nthe present Sun. As the late David Griffard pointed out:\n\u201cAs point sources...apparent differences in the size of stars are only differences in\nbrightness. To appear literally as an ordinary star (about 3rd or 4th magnitude) as\nseen on a clear night, the present Sun would have to be removed about 10 light-years.\nEven if much closer and really, say, at zero magnitude...it would still have been four\nor five light-years away.\n\u201cWith present rates of relative stellar motion as guidelines, the growth from star to\nSun would have taken many tens of thousands of years even if the fastest observed\nclosing speed (about 60 mi/sec) is chosen; if at slower, more common speeds, (e.g. 12\nmi/sec), many eons longer.\u201d !!!\nIt is, then, the words \u201cno bigger than a star\u201d that seems to have led to the objection. \u201cNo\nbigger than\u201d should not, however, be construed to mean \u201cno closer than.\u201d In any case, who\never said anything about the size of the approaching Sun having been of 3rd or 4th magni-\ntude? Obviously, the Okanagan Indians, who were not astronomers, were not using this term\nin a strictly astronomical sense. They were merely reporting what their ancestors had claimed\nto have seen.\nBesides, as Griffard himself pointed out, \u201cif first seen, say from the distance of Pluto\n(taken as an arbitrary estimate of the limits of the Sun\u2019s domain) the Sun conceivably could\nhave appeared star-like and the time-line be reduced.\u201d !!2 And, true enough, as seen from the\nvicinity of Pluto, the Sun is still no bigger than \u201ca bright star,\u201d1!3 described as a \u201cpinpoint\nSun\u201d even though \u201cintensely bright.\u201d!!4 At Pluto\u2019s mean distance from the Sun, taken at\n3,656 million miles, and traveling at 12 mi/sec, Earth would have reached its present position\nin the Solar System in a mere ten years\u2014but only if it had invaded the System in a direct\nvector. The probability, however, is that, once captured within the Sun\u2019s attractive force, the\nSaturnian system would have slowly spiraled in, much in the manner hypothesized by\nastrophysicists in relation to their revised history of the Solar System as outlined above. Such\nan entry could have taken any number of years in excess of ten. Astronomers are fond of\ndescribing such events as having taken millions of years. Will they here allow me at least a\nfew thousand?\nBut then the reader might have\u2014should have, really\u2014noticed a discrepancy in our\nthinking at this point. How could the Sun, appearing no bigger than a star, have been visible\nthrough our plasmasphere when that same plasmasphere has been theorized to have been\nopaque enough to blot out the stars? Can we have our cake and eat it too? Of course not. And\nhere a confession is in order.\nI have presented these mytho-historical snippets concerning the approaching Sun as if the\nevent took place during the age of darkness when, in truth, the event took place later. In other\nwords, I have presented these data out of chronological sequence merely to make my point.\nThe approaching Sun, appearing no bigger than a star, became visible to Earth\u2019s inhabitants\nat that time when the plasmasphere came in contact with that of the Sun itself.

To be sure, much more than that ensued but that is left to the planned sequel to\nthis work.\n\nSEVENTH INTERLUDE\n\nWe can now add to our set of theses which will read as follows:\n\nHypothesis #1: That, from what can be deduced from ancient as well as primitive\nastronomical lore, Earth had once been a satellite of the planet Saturn, originally a brown\ndwarf star, which, because of its proximity, loomed large in the sky as a distinct disc larger\nthan the apparent size of the full Moon.\n\nHypothesis #2: That, still according to ancient astronomical lore, during this\nindeterminate period, Satur was the only visible celestial body in Earth\u2019s primordial sky.\n\nHypothesis #3: That, as seen from Earth, the Saturnian primary did not rise and/or set, but\nremained visibly immobile at all times.\n\nHypothesis #4: That Saturn\u2019s immobility was due to the fact that Earth was stationed\ndirectly \u201cbeneath\u201d Saturn\u2019s south pole and that, from Earth, Saturn therefore appeared to be\npermanently fixed in the north celestial sphere, the very place now occupied by the Pole Star.\nWhat this also means is that Saturn and Earth were linearly aligned with both of them sharing\nthe same axis of rotation.\n\nHypothesis #5: That both Earth and Saturn were embedded in a plasmasphere centered on\nproto-Saturn, the opacity of which enabled proto-Saturn\u2019s radiation to be reflected toward all\nterrestrial latitudes.\n\nHypothesis #6: That, according to some of man\u2019s earliest memories, Earth was originally\nengulfed in what our ancestors persistently referred to as darkness. This was an age which,\ndespite its remoteness in time, ended up etching itself indelibly in human consciousness. It\nwas a time during which the Sun, the Moon, and the stars were not yet visible in the sky.\nSaturn ruled alone.\n\nHypothesis #7: This age, we have also found out, could not have been one of total\ndarkness, and that, in fact, mankind itself remembers that the Saturnian deity actually shed a\nfeeble light. The terrestrial environment during this age was bathed in a perpetual twilight or,\nrather, a protracted dawn, which man remembered as the dawn of Creation.\n\nHypothesis #8: Proto-Saturn\u2019s illumination, feeble as it might have been, together with\nthe plasmasphere\u2019s opacity are recognized as the means by which the stars were kept from\nvisibility. The plasmasphere\u2019s opacity, however, would probably not have been enough to\nblot out the Sun..\n\nHypothesis #9: That, during this period, a nebulous entity, which our ancestors had\ndifficulty in describing clearly, surrounded the Saturnian primary. We have conjectured this\nentity to have been a placental cloud, or circumstellar disk, surrounding the Saturnian orb.\nThis entity seems to have been that to which the ancients alluded to as Chaos.\n\nHypothesis #10: During this same unspecified period, the Saturnian orb was seen to float\nover an apparition which, to ancient man, looked like water, a cosmic ocean. This \u201cwater\u201d\nwas probably the same nebular disk which, spinning slowly, would have had the appearance\nof a celestial whirlpool.\n\nHypothesis # 11: That, due to Saturn\u2019s immobility, and the absence of the Sun, ancient\nman had nothing at his disposal by which he could calculate the passage of time.",

In fact, as Wallace Thornhill has correctly speculated, life might have\nbeen much better suited to Earth as a satellite of the brown dwarf star that was proto-Saturn\nout in the far reaches of space.! Nor is this merely Thornhill\u2019s conjecture. Astronomers are\nnow voicing similar propositions.\nThere was a time, not so long ago, when the idea of life surviving on a planet heated by a\ndwarf star in the coldness of space outside our Solar System would have been deemed bizarre\nin the extreme. Newer studies and discoveries, however, have tended to make such a scenario\nquite palatable. Thus, those who have sought signs of habitable worlds other than our own\nare now looking to dwarf stars to furnish such evidence. Ken Croswell put it in a nutshell\nwhen he stated that: \u201cFar from being desolate backwaters, red dwarfs may harbour an abun-\ndance of alien life.\u201d\n\u201cIt was always thought that any planet orbiting a red dwarf would be an extremely\nunlikely place to find life. But it now looks as though these dim red suns could har-\nbour most of the Galaxy\u2019s life-bearing worlds.\u201d3\nFor one thing, as Croswell notes, stars like our present Sun are relatively rare while four\nout of every five stars in our Galaxy happen to be red dwarfs. These stars have a somewhat\ncool core and the nuclear reactions which are believed to fuel them take place at a slow rate.\n\u201cThe nearest red dwarf\u2014Proxima Centauri, which is 4 light years from Earth,\u201d notes Cros-\nwell, \u201cemits less visible light in a century than the Sun does in a week.\u201d It is no wonder,\nthen, that dwarf stars had earlier been ruled out as sustainers of habitable planets.\nThis problem has now been overcome by positing planets \u201chuddled close enough\u201d to such\nstars, which contiguity would ensure \u201ca balmy climate.\u201d As Croswell explains: \u201cFor a red\ndwarf with one-hundredth of the Sun\u2019s brightness, for instance, a planet would be at a suit-\nable temperature if it circled ten times closer to its parent star than the Earth does to the\nSun.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019d asked me a few years ago,\u201d David Soderblom has been reported to have stated,\n\u201cI would have said that red dwarfs have a very low probability of having life-bearing plan-",

Proto-Saturn has been hypothesized to have been a\nbrown, rather than a red, dwarf star. Brown dwarf stars, however, are actually red; they have\nmerely been designated as brown dwarfs only because the term \u201cred dwarfs\u201d had already\nbeen assigned to their slightly more massive siblings. True, brown dwarfs are said to radiate\nthrough a slightly different process. They are believed to \u201cglow dimly from heat generated by\ngravitational contraction and the fusion of deuterium.\u201d7 (If, as some claim, stars are fueled\nelectrically, however, even this distinction disappears.) In any case, both red and brown\ndwarfs come in various masses, so that the dividing line between them, as that between\nbrown dwarfs and planets, becomes merely arbitrary. If, therefore, life-bearing planets can\norbit red dwarf stars, they can just as easily accompany brown dwarfs. And, to be sure, even\nas the writing of this work progresses, the idea that planets can orbit brown dwarfs is being\nseriously considered.8\nPHASE LOCK\nAs Croswell explained, planetary orbits around dwarf stars \u201cwould come at a price.\u201d?\n\u201cA planet in such a tight orbit would become tidally locked to its star, just as our own\nMoon is locked to Earth. One side would perpetually face the star, while the other\nfaced away.\u201d 10\nWhile this, too, is in keeping with our own hypothesis, it also brings to mind Lynn Rose\u2019s\npostulate, which we contested in an earlier chapter, concerning the nature of Earth\u2019s marriage\nto proto-Saturn. As we saw there, he, too, had posited a similar phase-lock wherein Earth\ndisplayed the same hemisphere toward its primary, but contrary to our axis-sharing hypothe-\nsis. Without thinking to credit Rose, such a phase-lock between Earth and proto-Saturn had\nalso been considered by Frederick Hall who assumed Earth \u201cto have formerly been a nearly\nspherical satellite of Saturn, circling the giant orb in about 28 days, with a slow spin and the\nsame side of the Earth always facing Saturn.\u201d!! As he continued:\n\u201cProto-Saturn is [read \u2018would have been\u2019] vast in comparison to Earth and perhaps\nmuch larger [read \u2018more massive\u2019] than the body we know today. Consider it [to have\nbeen] about the smallest possible red dwarf star or a brown dwarf star...\u201d !2\nHall, however, was also convinced that Earth had shared the same axis of rotation with\nproto-Saturn, with the latter having been permanently located in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole,\nexactly as posited in the present work. How, then, did he reconcile his two opposing views?",

Hall attempted to resolve the diffi-\nculty by claiming that Earth was originally phase-locked with proto-Saturn before it was torn\naway from its primary during the system\u2019s entry into the Sun\u2019s domain. According to Hall,\nthe \u201cpolar alignment occurred due to a massive gravitational pull on Saturn\u201d which would\nhave left Earth \u201ctrailing after it.\u201d!3 As of this writing, Thornhill, too, is of similar belief. The\n\u201cspectacular Saturnian polar configuration,\u201d according to him, came into being \u201cwhen [proto-\nSaturn\u2019s] planetary system was disrupted by the Sun in a manner similar to that when Jupiter\ndisrupted comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 into a \u2018string of pearls\u2019.\u201d!4 Thus, according to him, the\nSaturnian \u201ccollinear equilibrium...could not have been primordial.\u201d 15\nTo be sure, this is not necessarily a fallacious interpretation and it should not be dis-\nmissed out of hand. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that as far back as man\u2019s memory\ncan reach, the Saturnian sun had always occupied the north celestial pole. What the situation\nmight have been prior to that will be discussed in a later chapter of this work.\nATMOSPHERIC AMPLITUDE\nOne problem inherent in the phase-lock theory involves the amount of heat shed by the\ndwarf star on the orbiting planet\u2019s hemisphere facing it. As Croswell pointed out, \u201cthe day\nside of a red dwarf planet would fry.\u201d!\u00a9 What is perhaps worse is that \u201cthe night side would\nbe so frigid\u201d that the atmosphere itself would be expected to freeze. 17 How could life have\nsurvived such conditions.\nOne way out of this dilemma, according to Croswell, would be to postulate that such a\nplanet\u2019s atmosphere would be \u201csufficiently thick.\u201d !8\n\u201cResearchers [have] calculated that gases circulating in the atmosphere would then be\nable to transport heat from the planet\u2019s day side to its night side, warming the night\nair so that it wouldn\u2019t freeze out.\u201d!9\nSuch transportation of heat from one hemisphere to the other would not only warm the\nplanet\u2019s night side, it would also cool its day side resulting in a balanced heat regime.\nWhat is interesting in this is that the same situation had also been proposed in relation to\nEarth itself. It was in the mid-19th century that the British anatomist, Richard Owen,\ndemanded a denser terrestrial atmosphere, containing elevated concentrations of carbon\ndioxide and reduced oxygen, in order for prehistoric pterodactyls to have been able to fly and\nnavigate.2? Much later, Frederic Jueneman had much to say concerning the inability of\npterodactyls, known to have had wingspans of up to 36 feet, to fly and navigate in Earth\u2019s\npresent sky, and why a denser atmospheric envelope would have been required for such\nflight in prehistoric times.?!",

According to Berner, this was due to \u201cthe rise\nof land plants in general and in particular to the vast and verdant swamps that characterized\nthe Carboniferous.\u201d32\n\u201cAll those swamp plants spit oxygen into the atmosphere, and when they died, they\nescaped the open-air decomposition by bacteria that would have drawn oxygen back\nout of the atmosphere. Instead they sank into the swamps, ultimately forming coal\ndeposits that gave the Carboniferous its name.\u201d33\nNever mind that there is no direct evidence of higher atmospheric oxygen levels during\nthe Carboniferous. After all, Berner\u2019s hypothesis is simply based on a computer model. Even\nso, as Shanti Menon explained, the oxygen-rich atmosphere hypothesized by Berner would\nhave made for \u201ca denser atmosphere that provided more lift and thus made it easier for\n[Carboniferous insects] to fly.\u201d34 While this is in keeping with Jueneman\u2019s Pleiongaea, it\nshould be kept in mind that, as Menon was forced to admit, the whole idea is \u201ca hypothesis\nbased on a hypothesis.\u201d35 But then, around 1985, Dale Russell and Parvez Kumar also came\nto the conclusion that Earth\u2019s atmosphere had to have been much denser than at present.\nBut is a denser atmospheric envelope really required for the sustenance of life on a planet\nreliant for its heat on a dwarf star? Until recently, such a dense atmosphere around a dwarf\nstar planet had been thought to be detrimental to life since it would prevent the star\u2019s rays\nfrom reaching the planet\u2019s surface and thus inhibiting photosynthesis, \u201ca serious blow for the\ndevelopment of life as we know it.\u201d But then, simulation of a red dwarf planet\u2019s\natmosphere conducted by Robert Haberle and Manoj Joshi in the 1990s showed that a thick\nenvelope would not really be required. As they stated, \u201ceven a thin atmosphere would do the\ntrick.\u201d37\n\u201cIf the planet had only 15 per cent as much air as the Earth...that would still ferry\nenough heat around to the dark side to keep the atmosphere from freezing out.\u201d38\nThe density, or otherwise, of a planet\u2019s atmosphere, however, is relative. Even an atmos-\nphere as dense as that of Venus, which has been blamed for its infernal heat, much denser\nthan that proposed for Earth by the above proponents, is not enough to obstruct the Sun\u2019s\nrays. And if pterodactyls and giant insects really required a denser atmosphere in order to fly\nand navigate, we will accept that. After all, the view that Earth was nestled within proto-Sat-\nurn\u2019s envelope is not incompatible with a denser terrestrial atmosphere.\nTHE CRADLE OF LIFE\nKeeping the atmosphere from freezing on the night side of such a planet is one thing,\nkeeping the water, still believed to be the cradle of life, in the same hemisphere from suffer-\ning the same fate is quite another. \u201cEven in some of Joshi and Haberle\u2019s models, there re-\nmained freezing conditions on the planet\u2019s dark side.\u201d At first, this led to something of an",

Even if the oceans\u2019 surface were to freeze on the dark side, rea-\nsoned Heath, there might still be liquid layers deep underneath which would be kept from\nfreezing by the planet\u2019s own geothermal heat. \u201cThis would allow liquid water to flow back to\nthe day side.\u201d40\nIn the proto-Saturnian model, such a transference of liquid water from one hemisphere to\nthe other would not even be required. As we have seen, according to more than one re-\nsearcher, Earth would have been located within proto-Saturn\u2019s plasma sheath. To repeat, as\nboth Ashton and Thornhill claimed, the heat and light of proto-Saturn would have been \u201cra-\ndiated both outwards and inwards from the photosphere\u201d; that \u201cEarth, situated inside the\nspherical envelope of such a star...would find the energy flux almost equal over the entire\nplanet\u201d; and that \u201call objects orbiting in that region would receive the same energy per unit\narea of their surface.\u201d4!\nNo freezing of oceanic surfaces would then enter the picture.\nSTATIONARY STAR\nOn such a planet in phase-lock as envisioned by Croswell, the red dwarf sun would never\nset. \u201cInstead,\u201d he tells us, this sun \u201cwould hover perpetually at the same place in the sky.\u201d4?\nAs we have seen, this would also have been the case in our axial alignment model except\nthat, in our case, the proto-Saturnian sun would have hovered in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole.\nIn this instance, the model proposed by Croswell runs into certain difficulties which the Sat-\nurnian exemplar overcomes.\nAs Croswell pointed out:\n\u201cPlants and trees might orient themselves toward [the hovering red dwarf star] as they\ngrew. But because the sun is stationary some regions would never see direct sunlight.\nA region in the shadow of a mountain, for example, would be forever in shade, pre-\nventing photosynthesis there.\u201d3\nThe situation would be even worse in the total darkness of the opposing hemisphere. This\npredicament, however, would not affect the proto-Saturnian model since, as already noted,\nthe light from the hovering proto-Saturnian sun, no matter how feeble, would have been re-\nflected back from the enveloping plasma to all those areas devoid of direct sunlight.\nLONG-LIVED SUN\nHow long could such a situation have endured?\nCroswell tells us that red dwarf stars actually have an advantage over sun-like ones. This\nis because their lesser mass allows them to \u201cburn\u201d their reduced fuel \u201cso frugally that some\nwill survive for more than 1000 billion years,\u201d whereas the Sun, it is claimed, \u201cwill die\nwithin a mere 8 billion years.\u201d44",

These plan-\nets, however, are \u201cmore akin to Jupiter\u201d than they are to Earth. Two Jupiter-sized planets, for\ninstance, have been detected circling the red dwarf known as Gliese 876 which is said to lie a\nmere 15 light years from us. \u201cThese particular planets are unlikely to harbour life...since Ju-\npiter-sized planets \u2014at least in our Solar System\u2014consist mostly of hydrogen and helium.\u201d 4\nLaurance Doyle, on the other hand, believes that his team may have detected an Earth-\nsized world around CM Draconis, a binary red dwarf system. Because of the difficulty of\ndetecting such small bodies, Doyle could only supply a \u201c50-50\u201d chance of this being correct.\nIn the meantime, however, he and his team have other candidates which, as of this writing,\nthey were still investigating.47\nThere are other details brought out by Croswell in relation to dwarf star planets, but these,\ntoo, must be reserved for a future volume. There is, however, one other element of such a\nsystem that I wish to touch upon because it serves to introduce the subject of the next chapter\nwhich, in turn, will allow us to investigate further whether an axial alignment of Earth with\nits proto-Saturnian sun was ever the case. As Croswell informed his readers, a red dwarf\nplanet would be bereft of seasons since \u201cthe tidal pull of the star would prevent its spin axis\nfrom tilting.\u201d In the model he espouses, needless to say, only one side would be basked in\nperpetual light, with the other hemisphere being in perpetual darkness. In this model, the\nhottest place on the planet would be one spot on the equator, with temperatures falling in a\nradiating path, \u201cfalling toward freezing near the dividing line between the day and night\nsides.\u201d Moreover, an ice cap would form in the very centre of the night side.48 As Heath\nphrased it:\n\u201cThe daylight hemisphere is going to be where the action is. For one thing, it\u2019s going\nto be pretty cold on the dark side. We know that there are organisms that can sit in\nwater pockets in the ice and carry out photosynthesis, but they can\u2019t do that if there\u2019s\nno light getting there.\u201d 49\nThere is no need here to repeat that this is not the condition expected in an axial aligned\nsystem encased in a plasma sheath. And, as we have also noted, life can, and does, maintain\nand propagate itself in total darkness right here on Earth. So why do I even bring this up? I\ndo so because a world with no seasons, or with but one season, is precisely what ancient man\nproclaimed to have been the case \u201cin the beginning.\u201d More than that, it is precisely what we\nfind encoded in Earth\u2019s palaeontological remains.",

This\nmeans that not all of Earth\u2019s latitudes receive the same amount of direct radiation from\nthe Sun at all times. Summer arrives in the northern hemisphere because Earth\u2019s axis\nduring that time tilts the north pole toward the Sun (closest during summer solstice). In\nwinter, it is the south pole that is tilted toward the Sun (closest during winter solstice). In\nbetween, during the equinoxes, both hemispheres receive the same amount of solar radiation\nbecause Earth\u2019s axis points neither toward nor away from the Sun. This also means that, in\nthe southern hemisphere, the seasons are reversed, with summer coming in winter, autumn\ncoming in spring, winter in summer, and spring in autumn. But, while all this is\nastronomically true, it is not necessarily always apparent down here on Earth. Thus, the\nfourfold seasonal division of the year can seldom be recognized in the annual cycle itself.\nIn the Western World, the seasons have been calculated in accordance with the yearly\ncycle of cultivated plants: Winter as the season of dormancy, spring as that of sowing, sum-\nmer as that of growth, and fall, or autumn, as that of harvest. However, as we all know,\nspring and fall are merely transitional periods. Winter and summer are the only two seasons\nthat have a distinctly extreme difference. Beyond that, seasonal temperatures pay no attention\nto the inclination of Earth\u2019s axis. Parts of spring can be as cold or as warm as winter or sum-\nmer, as so, also, can parts of autumn. Climate depends on shifting winds, themselves reliant\non the evaporation of water, and also on the particular topography of the land. Thus, for in-\nstance, because Egyptian harvest was totally reliant on the inundation of the Nile, the ancient\nEgyptian year was divided into only three seasons\u2014akhet (inundation), peret (emergence),\nand shemu (aridity). The Hindus, on the other hand, reckon a six-fold division\u2014rtus: vasan-\ntika (spring), graishma (summer), varshika (rainy season), sarad (autumn), hima (early win-\nter), and sishira (late winter), all of which, it is stressed, \u201coverlap one another.\u201d\u201d\nSeasons do not mean the same thing to everyone. The ancient Celts divided the year by\nreligious festivals into four quarterly divisions without any concern for the solstices or\nequinoxes\u2014in other words without any recognition of the shortest or longest days.\u2019 These\n\u2018 easons are caused by the inclination of Earth\u2019s axis to the plane of the ecliptic.

Changes of temperature there are but slight, with the dif-\nference of seasons barely perceptible. Not only can the natives observe no change of season,\nthe vegetation itself is not materially affected throughout the year. So, likewise, in the Kings-\nmill Islands, also known as the Gilbert Islands, situated directly beneath the equator, where\nthe natives reckon their \u201cyear\u201d as a period of ten months without any reference to seasons.\"\n\nIt can thus be seen that, while the official seasons are tied to the astronomical calendar,\nactual seasonal variations, climates, and temperatures are not entirely dependent on Earth\u2019s\naxial tilt. All of which raises the question: Are seasons necessary for the propagation and\nsustenance of life?\n\nTHE GOD OF SEASONS\n\nOn an Earth engulfed in the semi-darkness of a perpetual dawn, bereft of the succession\nof day and night, with a radiating warmth reflecting uniformly, or quasi-uniformly, on all\nparts of our globe, our world could only have experienced a single season. The evidence for\nwhether this was ever so can only be found here on Earth. But, before delving into that,\nbecause seasons would eventually have come about, our reconstruction of these primeval\nevents demands that the mytho-historical record should connect the arrival of the four sea-\nsons with the Saturnian deity man had been wont to venerate. Can this demand also be met?\n\nWe note, for starters, that the association of the word \u201cseason\u201d with Saturn is discernible\nin Latin. In fact, the English word \u201cseason\u201d is itself ultimately derived, through a meandering\nroute of associated European words, from the Latin sationem, accusative satio, \u201csowing\u201d?\nAccording to the ancients themselves, it was this word, satio, and or satus, that is \u201cseed,\u201d\nfrom which the name of Saturn\u2014i.e., Saturnus\u2014was derived.\u201d And it is this, among other\nmatters, which ended up casting Saturn as a god of agriculture.\n\nHermann Collitz, on the other hand, traced the derivation of the name Saturnus to the\nPersian (that is Old Iranian) word xsaeta, with the dual meaning of \u201cbright\u201d and \u201cking\u201d or\n\u201cruler,\u201d!* which appears as an epithet of Yima/Saturn.\u2019* As he indicated, an older form of\nSaturnus, which was sometimes written Saeturnus, was Saetus. He was therefore convinced\nthat the name Saeturnus derived from Saetus through the Avestic xsaeto/xsaeta\u2014which he",

Thus,\nin describing Saturn\u2019s Golden Age, Ovid spoke of mankind as having been \u201ccontent with\nfoods that grew without cultivation\u201d in \u201ca season of everlasting spring.\u201d'\u201d It was only after\nSaturn\u2019s reign had come to an end that the springtime \u201cwhich had prevailed of old\u201d was\nshortened while \u201ca cycle of four seasons in the year, winter, summer, changeable autumn,\nand a brief spring\u201d was instituted.\"* And was it not because of this that Janus, whom we have\nalready seen identified by the ancients themselves as Saturnus, was deified inter alia as the\ngod of the seasons?\u201d\n\nIt was no different in the New World where we have already met the Peruvian Kon Tiki\nViracocha. Having previously identified him as a Saturnian deity, it is not surprising to\ndiscover that he was believed to have been the \u201cguiding power in regulating the seasons\u201d\nwhich seasons were actually ordained by him.\u201d\n\nFurther north in Arizona, the Indians of Oraibi venerated a god called Machito who, like\nthe Saturnian deity of other races, existed in darkness at a time when \u201cthere was no sun, no\nmoon, and no stars.\u201d\u201d It is said that the people complained \u201cbecause of the darkness and the\ncold.\u201d\u201d While the cold mentioned here might seem to contradict our thesis, it should be\nunderstood that the record in question involves a protracted series of events covering a pe-\nriod which goes beyond what is encompassed in this work. This cold, of which the mytho-\nhistorical record has much to say, descended upon the world at the end of Saturn\u2019s Golden\nAge\u00ae\u2122 but before the appearance of the seasons. In fact, it was after Machito had produced\nthe Sun, which dissolved the cold, together with the Moon and the stars, that he \u201cappointed\ntimes and seasons.\u201d\u2122\n\nMuch more can be said but, at this point, I must stop because we are now encroaching on\nthe era of Saturn\u2019s Golden Age which actually came later and which topic must be reserved\nfor its proper chronological place in the planned sequel to this volume. Even so, it behooves\nus to remember the words of Frederick Hall who considered the era with which we are\npresently concerned as having been \u201cthe primitive phase of Saturn\u2019s Golden Age.\u201d\u201d> As he\nwrote:",

It should\nhowever be noted right from the start that temperature, nutrition, and environmental factors\ncan greatly modify this response. Also, closely related varieties of species can, and do, re-\nspond differently to identical photoperiodic conditions due to inherited differences in their\nmake-up.\nWhen it comes to fauna, the most conspicuous activities correlated to photoperiodism\nconsist of changes in pelage and/or plumage, the migratory instincts of birds, and the repro-\nductive process, each of which occurs with marked regularity at a particular time each year.\nWhen animals held in captivity are subjected to artificial lighting conditions which mimic a\nday-night succession that is different from the natural one, reproduction, bird migration, and\nother activities can be induced out of season. This seems to prove that such activities are\nregulated by the changing daily periods of light and darkness\u2014in other words by the succes-\nsion of the seasons.\nIn artificial situations, as little as nine hours of light per day was sufficient for stimulating\nthe physiological changes responsible for these activities. The response, it has been found,\nbecomes rapid under long days, and sluggish under short ones. Thus, changes in\nphysiological responses, such as change in breeding season, occurs in certain birds and\nmammals when transported from a southern to a northern latitude and/or vice versa. And yet,\nin equatorial regions, where day lengths are constant, mammals and birds continue to breed,\nchange their plumage, and migrate as if the day lengths actually varied. Do they then keep\ncount of the days? Can they keep time? Or is it that they have adapted so well to their envi-\nronment that their physiology changes without response to photoperiodism? To be sure,\nstudies of certain species of birds failed to show any influence of light on their reproductive\ncycle.\u201d\u201d Would animals not breed had there been no succession of day and night? Would they\nstop breeding in an environment of perpetual dawn and an everlasting spring? Or would they\nadapt?\nThe flowering of plants, the formation of roots, runners, tubers, and bulbs are also\ncontrolled by photoperiodism. The photoperiodic reaction of plants takes place in the leaves,\nbut the response occurs elsewhere. Not all plants, however, react the same way. Short-day\nplants, for instance, fail to flower when days exceed a certain duration; long-day plants fail to\nflower unless days exceed a certain duration. The critical day lengths for these plants,\nmoreover, differ widely not only from species to species but also among varieties of the same",

However, the inhibition of flowering by short-day plants through red light can be\nprevented by the inclusion of red light of greater wave length (or what is known as far-red).\u201d\nSince Saturn is here posited to have been a brown dwarf star, its propensity of red light,\nmainly in the far-red, would therefore have been conducive to plant growth.\nOn the other hand, as every gardener knows, some flowers close up at night and re-open\nwhen the Sun comes up. What, then, would have happened to such plants attempting to thrive\nin a world where the succession of day and night was replaced by a perpetual dawn-like\nmurkiness? The answer is actually simple: Had such plants existed at the time, they would\nhave had to adapt to their environment as others have done, and continue to do, in the present\nworld.\nTHE SUB-TROPICAL ARCTIC\nAs early as the nineteenth century it was \u201cadmitted by all scientific authorities that at one\ntime the regions within the Arctic Circle enjoyed a tropical or nearly tropical climate.\u201d These\nwords were written in 1885 by William Warren in his attempt to prove that man\u2019s original\nParadise had been located at Earth\u2019s north polar region.\u201d He did not assert this as merely his\nsay-so; he named authorities and quoted from them.\n\u201cThe Arctic regions, probably up to the North Pole, were not only free from ice, but\nwere covered with a rich and luxuriant vegetation.\u201d*!\n\u201cOne of the most startling and important of the scientific discoveries of the last\ntwenty years has been that of the relics of a luxuriant Miocene flora in various parts\nof the Arctic regions.

Thus, for instance, writers in New Scientist proposed that the Arctic Eo-\ncene\u2019s subtropical climate can be explained if the oceans transported far more heat to the\npoles than they do at present.\u201d But evidence of the atmospheric circulation required for this,\nwhich depends on temperature differential, is lacking.

But one has to keep in mind that if Saturn acted as the sun during mankind\u2019s\nprimitive past, it must also have been Earth\u2019s sun during ages long before. Moreover, since\nSaturn\u2019s present illumination and heat are nowhere close to what we have postulated them to\nhave been during man\u2019s early career on this planet, it stands to reason that its radiant energy\ndissipated relatively fast. This would also make us assume that, in ages prior to the advent of\nmankind, Saturn\u2019s radiant energy, and in fact even its mass, must have been greater still. It is\neven possible that its illumination, at close quarters to Earth, would have been bright enough\nto bathe the world in perpetual daylight rather than the constant dusk that primitive man later\nexperienced. As we have seen, scientific consensus favors a dimmer sun during Earth\u2019s past\ngeologic ages. Could not this dimmer sun have been the Saturnian sun which later greeted\nman\u2019s appearance on Earth?\n(What should also be kept in mind is that if our hypothesis is anywhere close to being\ncorrect, the dating of Earth\u2019s past geologic ages would be based on fallacious evidence.)\nFROM POLE TO POLE AND IN BETWEEN\nI have been stressing the discoveries in the Canadian High Arctic but, if the truth is to be\nknown, similar evidence is available from other parts of the northern hemisphere. Oswald\nHeer described 2,632 Arctic plant species, 1,627 of which were actually discovered by him.\nIn his seven-volume epic on the subject, published between the years 1868 and 1883, Heer\nstressed the luxuriant plant life that thrived during the Tertiary in northern polar regions.\nAmong those that grew in Greenland, he noted magnolias and fig trees.* Similarly in Spits-\nbergen where he noted the Tertiary thriving of such trees as pines, firs, spruces, cypresses,\nelms, hazels, and even water lilies.\u201d Forests which once flourished in Spitsbergen have left\nseams of coal from twenty-five to thirty feet thick. Fossil specimens of fig palms and the gi-\nant Redwood (Sequoia gigantea), which now grow in California, have been retrieved from an\narea stretching from the Bering Strait to north of Labrador. As D. H. Campbell admitted: \u201cIt\nis difficult to imagine any possible conditions of climate in which these plants could grow so\nnear the pole, deprived of sunlight for many months of the year.\u201d\u00ae Fossil corals, which can\nonly grow in tropical waters, were also discovered there in large formations. Corals, in fact,\ngrew all over polar North America\u2014in Alaska, Canada, and even in Greenland.\u201d\nThe same situation is evident at the opposite end of the world in the freezing regions of\nAntarctica.

Shackleton discovered seven seams of coal at about latitude 85\u00b0, each of which\nwas between three and seven feet thick, testimonials to ancient forests which once grew\nwhere now not a single tree, not even a blade of grass, can grow.\u00ae The coal seams that run\nthrough the Transantarctic Mountains are some of the most extensive on Earth.\u2122 Sandstone,\nassociated with this coal, was found to contain petrified coniferous wood.\u00ae Fossils from the\nPliocene include well-preserved wood in the form of tree stems as well as roots together with\nthe remains of marine life. (And this is to say nothing about fossil forests from even earlier\neras found near the South Pole, when the climate believed to have prevailed at the time\nshould not have allowed such growth.\u201d) In 1935, Admiral Byrd could write that: \u201cHere at the\nsouthernmost known mountain in the world, scarcely two hundred miles from the South Pole,\nwas found conclusive evidence that the climate of Antarctica was once temperate or even\nsub-tropical.\u201d*\nThe Eocene evidence of vast forests in the Antarctic has been attributed to a paleolatitude\nwhich was close to that of present Madagascar, while Antarctica is supposed to have still\nbeen drifting toward the pole.\u201d Continental drift can therefore be used to solve the mystery\nby those who adhere to this belief. Melvin Cook, however, is of a different opinion. Ac-\ncording to his findings, Antarctica \u201cappears not to have moved appreciably in continental\nshift\u201d since the continents which were once in contact with it \u201cleft Antarctica in radial\ndirections,\u201d\u201d\u00b0 thus leaving it more or less in the same locality. Besides, as we have seen, the\nproblem also involves the Arctic regions where, even according to orthodoxy, continental\ndrift cannot save the day. But the enigma entails more than just Earth\u2019s polar regions; it also\nembraces the latitudes in between. Thus, from early in the twentieth century, many\npaleobotanists were convinced that \u201cduring by far the greater portion of time since the Azoic\nera, mild, benign climatic conditions have existed.\u201d\u201d According to Dolph Hooker:\n\u201cIt is also the concensus [sic.] that, astonishingly and inexplicably, such conditions\nwere comparatively uniform over most of Earth\u2019s surface; that temperate climate\nextended both north and south to within the polar circles. It is also believed that,\namazingly, seasonal effects during most of geological time have been much less pro-\nnounced than they are now.\u201d\nWriting in 1912, F. H. Knowlton stated that:",

How could Earth\u2019s po-\nlar regions been blessed with a sub-tropical climate while the rest of the world remained lit-\ntle, if at all, warmer than it is at present? As Barbara Bell admitted: \u201cIt is by no means clear\nthat solar radiation sufficiently intense to keep the poles as warm as they appear to have been\nat times would not heat the tropics more than observations indicate.\u201d\nTHE CRETACEOUS CLIMATE\nContinental drift, through sea-floor spreading, is an ongoing process. Christopher\nScotese, a geologist, now predicts that, in another 250 million years, Great Britain will have\nbeen pushed to a near-Arctic locale, with the Atlantic Ocean having become nothing but a\ndistant memory. Just as all land masses are believed to have been joined together, 250 mil-\nlion years ago, in a super-continent which geologists have named Pangaea, a new mega-con-\ntinent, already dubbed Pangaea Ultima, will by then have formed. Africa would have\nrammed Europe, uplifting the colliding edges in a Himalaya-like mountain range while eras-\ning the Mediterranean in the process. The Atlantic Ocean would first widen, then reverse its\ncourse and finally close up completely.\u201d\nIt is not, therefore, surprising that geologists and paleoclimatologists have tended to rely\non this process to account for the moving of once-tropical areas into what are now the Arctic\nand Antarctic regions. As noted in the above report, Great Britain seems destined to do ex-\nactly that. As we have seen, however, continental drift cannot be made to account for the\nsub-tropical fauna and flora of the Tertiary period, the remains of which are now found\nwithin the Arctic Circle, for the simple reason that the Arctic regions were already close to\ntheir present location at the time.

As Richard Kerr noted:\n\u201cThe earth of the Cretaceous Period 100 million years ago was unaccountably warm,\nas it generally had been since the end of the last great ice age 140 million years ear-\nlier...\u201d\u201d\n\u201cExplaining Cretaceous climate has been difficult because it differed so from today\u2019s.\nCoral reefs for which warm water is essential ranged as much as 1500 kilometers\ncloser to the poles than they do today, as did nonseasonal land plants. Deep ocean\nwater that now hovers near freezing was 15\u00b0 (Celsius) warmer...Alligators and croco-\ndiles seem to have thrived at latitudes as far north as that of present-day Labrador.\nAnd there is no evidence of any permanent ice like that which today deeply buries\nAntarctica and Greenland.\u201d\u2122\n\u201cNot only was it generally warmer during the Cretaceous, but it was particularly\nwarmer in the polar regions.\u201d*!\nBecause the position of the continents during the Cretaceous would have been different\nfrom the locales they would have occupied later during the Tertiary, scientists continued to\nseek an answer to the riddle of the earlier climate via continental drift. This was not only be-\ncause the lands within the present Arctic Circle would have been farther removed from polar\nregions than they would have been during the following Tertiary, but also because the\ndifferent continental configuration would have led to the development of an entirely different\nclimatic regime. It was thus reasoned that:\n\u201cContinents bunched in low latitudes near the equator, as Cretaceous continents\ntended to be, would allow warm ocean currents to carry heat poleward. High-latitude\npolar oceans, being less reflective than land, would also absorb more heat and further\nmoderate climate.\u201d\u201d\nmoderate climate.\u201d\nEric Barron and Warren Washington therefore decided to test this hypothesis by recreat-\ning the Cretaceous climate through the use of a computer model.\u00ae Others followed suit.*\nThere is no point in tracing the ups and downs of these various attempts and the\ndisagreements between them.

This evidence comes from tree rings. As every Boy Scout knows, tree\ntrunks are marked out in transverse section into concentric rings, one ring for each \u201cseason\u201d\nof growth. In order to tell the age of a felled tree, Boy Scouts are taught to count the number\nof rings laid out in its trunk. Known as annular rings, these growth marks owe their emer-\ngence to differences in the elements at the beginning and end of each growing period.\nFossilized trees from various past ages show distinct annular rings. Others do not. Wood\nretrieved from late Paleozoic deposits in the southern hemisphere has been said to show\npronounced ring growths. So, also, fossils of deciduous trees from the Cretaceous. In fact,\nfossilized wood samples ranging all the way from the Devonian to the Eocene have been\nclaimed to show well marked annular rings. The scientific literature on this subject, however,\nis very ambiguous. More recent work has tended to show that rings are either lacking or very\nweak in all known specimens from the Devonian period which seems to indicate a non-sea-\nsonal environment. Most fossil trees from the Carboniferous period, which followed the De-\nvonian, also lack rings. As Elso Barghoorn noted:\n\u201cOne impressive indicator of uniform climate over great areas of the Carboniferous\ncontinents is the great absence of annual growth rings in coal-swamp trees. The entire\nquestion of ring development in woody plants is one fraught with botanical variables\nas well as climatic variables. However, the consistent absence of any index of sea-\nsonal growth seems difficult to explain except on the assumption that winter cold and\nseasonality of rainfall were absent or at a minimum.\u201d\nBy the time we come to the late Permian period, still within the Paleozoic era, we end up\nwith a mixed bag. Fossil woods from Canada, Europe, and Asia have weak or non-existent\nrings, while those from South America, Africa, and Antarctica show prominent and wide\ngrowth rings. A mixed bag from trees growing in different areas may be expected. But what\nabout a similar mixed bag from trees known to have grown in the same locality? Thus, mov-\ning slightly closer to our time, we come to the Triassic period of the Mesozoic era. Few fossil",

In samples from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods of the same\nMesozoic era, as well as from the Early Tertiary period, tree rings range from prominent to\nnon-existent, depending on the paleolatitude in which they are claimed to have thrived.\nWhen it comes to polar fossil plants, as Edward Berry noted: \u201cDetailed comparisons of\nthese Arctic floras with contemporary floras from lower latitudes...show unmistakable\nevidence for the existence of climatic zones...\u201d C. P. Brooks reached the same opinion,\nclaiming that climatic zones existed in the Eocene,\u201d as so did Ralph Chaney, who pushed the\nmargin up to the Pliocene.\u201d As Jane Francis noted, samples of wood collected by her on\nAxel Heiberg Island showed clear annular rings over a quarter of an inch wide. And, because\nthe darker latewood added at the end of the growing season featured very narrow bands, the\nconclusion has been drawn that the trees grew rapidly during the twenty-four hour sunshine\nperiod of the Arctic summer and then closed up shop during the winter hours of darkness.\u201d\nThe problem with this, however, is that trees would not have survived such prolonged\nperiods of darkness.

The lines of separation between successive rings marks the limit of a\nmicroscopically thin layer of cells, known as the cambium, which lies between the wood and\nthe bark, at the end of each successive growth period. The bark then cracks and/or expands to\nallow for the new growth of wood, and the tree trunk is thus thickened. It should be noted,\nhowever, that the cambium responds mainly to conditions of temperature and rainfall rather\nthan the incidence of light.\nIn temperate climates, the cambium produces new wood only during spring and early\nsummer. It becomes inactive during autumn and winter. But what about trees growing in\ntropical and equatorial regions where seasonal differences disappear? Do they still grow\nrings?

As Barghoorn reported: \u201cIn existing woody plants, annual ring development may occur\nunder nearly uniform climatic conditions, as in equatorial rainforests.\u201d\u00b0* What, then, is it in\nthis seasonless environment that tells these trees that a year has passed and that it is time to\ngrow more wood and thus form a new ring?\nThat the growth of annular rings is not tied to seasonal change is evidenced by the fact\nthat some trees have been known to grow as much as three or four rings in one year. Nor is\nthis an uncommon situation, as Nelson Glueck noted, especially in trees which grow on\nsloping ground that turns wet and dry several times in one year because of rapid outflow of\nwater.\u201d According to an item in Nature magazine, multiple rings in larch trees were normal\nin 1919; in fact, larches seem to be prone to multiple ring growth.\u201d\nMeanwhile, trees which miss growing a ring in certain years have also been known.\u201d As\nHerbert Sorensen pointed out:\n\u201cIn dry and climatically harsh years, no detectable growth may occur. In this case no\nring is formed and the ring is missing for that season of the year.\u201d\u201d",

In fact,\nlet us be honest about it, they are not indicative of seasonal change at all. But if tree rings do\nnot indicate seasonal change, what, then, do they indicate?\n\nWe have already noted above that the cambium responsible for the growth of trees re-\nsponds mainly to conditions of temperature and rainfall rather than the incidence of light.\nAnd, in fact, when it comes to the growth rate of trees, water is the limiting factor. In other\nwords, water is the one true constituent which limits the growth of cambium and thus the\nformation of growth rings. This is what tree rings, when they grow at all, truly indicate\u2014a\ncycle dictated by the availability and cessation of an adequate water supply \u2014which is pro-\nbably what Ian Johnson meant by \u201cordinary seasonal growth cycle\u201d as opposed to \u201ca polar\nseasonality.\u201d Only in the most indirect way can tree rings be said to indicate seasonal change\nwhen they do so at all.\n\nThat being the case, the lower incidence of light from the Saturnian sun, as compared to\nthe higher incidence from our present Sun, would have posed no obstacle to the growth of\ntrees. Temperature would also have posed no problem because, while the Saturnian sun\nwould not have been as hot as our present Sun, its proximity to Earth would have compen-\nsated for its lower caloric output.\n\nAs we have seen, it is quite apparent that trees grow rings, or fail to grow rings,\nregardless of seasonal change or stability. More importantly, if trees can, as they do, grow\nrings in tropical and equatorial regions in which there is no appreciable seasonal change,\nwhat is so problematic with having trees growing rings in a sub-tropical Arctic which\nenjoyed but one spring-like season?\n\nPaleobotanists remain hard-put to account for the growth of sub-tropical forests and the\nexistence of sub-tropical animals within the Arctic Circle. Uniform heat and light, to say\nnothing of the absence of an ice cover, would have been required for the flourishing of such\nforests and the thriving of such animals.\n\nTHE AXIAL TILT HYPOTHESIS\n\nWhy not simply straighten Earth\u2019s axis?\n\nThis, too, would have ensured a world with one season, an eternal spring. And as difficult\nas it might be to later tilt Earth\u2019s axis to the angle it now holds, it seems more feasible than\nany of the hypotheses we have so far proposed. This, in fact, had been suggested by various\nauthorities at the end of the nineteenth century as, for instance, by Julius Hann: \u201cThe simplest\nand most obvious explanation of great secular changes in climate, and of former prevalence\nof higher temperatures in northern circumpolar regions, would be found in the assumption\nthat the earth\u2019s axis of rotation has not always had the same position, but that it may have",

In this respect it is noteworthy to\nnote that when, in the 1980s, remains of sub-tropical flora and fauna were discovered by So-\nviet scientists in Spitsbergen, the axial tilt hypothesis was revived and, as of this writing,\ncontinues to be the standing Russian (previously Soviet) understanding of what had to have\ntranspired in ages past.'*\n\u201cIn the early 1980s, scientists proved the far North had once been a tropical paradise.\nThe tilt of the earth shifted and so did the weather.\u201d\">\nMost scientists on the American continent, however, were not convinced.

To conform with thermodynamics, and an Earth\ntilted 23 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic [as at present], these environments had to\nbe considerably closer to the equator. If they were closer to the equator, then either\ncontinental drift occurred both much more rapidly and mysteriously than the geologi-\ncal record indicates, or else the Earth has tilted or experienced crustal slippage in\nsome fashion that allowed warming of these lands without disrupting the continuity of\nequatorial rainforests. Another mechanism has the Earth with little or no tilt to its axis\nof rotation, which removes seasonality and ensures light each day on each point of the\nglobe, coupled with a dense canopy that allows much more even temperatures despite\nvariation in latitude.\u201d\"\u201d\u201d\nAccording to Bernard Delair, theoretically, Earth ought to rotate on a vertical axis \u201cand\nmay actually have done so in the geologically recent past.\u201d\u2019\u201d\u00b0 And: \u201cThere ought to be no\nreason why any Earth-like planet undisturbed for untold ages should not have a vertically-\npositioned axis.\u201d!!\nUnfortunately, there are various problems with the axial tilt hypothesis. To begin with,\nDelair\u2019s declaration did not go unchallenged. As Michael Reade pointed out, \u201ca spinning ball\nforced to traverse an elliptical orbit around a primary would adopt a tilted attitude.\u201d As he, in\nturn, assured his readers, \u201cit is never possible to get a free-spinning ball to spin with its axis\neither vertical or horizontal: the principal axis of the ball always settles to a well-defined and\nseemingly invariable angle of tilt.\u201d This, as Reade pointed out, \u201chas long been known to\nengineers: spinning bodies, such as turbines or speed governors, impose asymmetric stresses\non their shaft bearings.\u201d\u201d\u201d\nTrue, as Jane Francis noted, had Earth\u2019s axis been perpendicular to the plane of the\necliptic, the Sun would have bathed the polar regions with twelve hours of light every day. At\nthe poles, however, the Sun\u2019s rays would have been weak and low-angled, similar to those\nexperienced just before sunset. And this would have been insufficient for the growth of\nplants such as the remains of which have been discovered in polar regions.'\u201d\nWhy not then propose a model which would combine both theories? Would not a\nperpendicular Earth orbiting around the Sun with Saturn stationed at Earth\u2019s north celestial\nsphere fill the bill? Not really because, for one thing, this would be contrary to what the my-\ntho-historical record has to tell us. We have seen that, time and again, the record states that,\nduring the age of semi-darkness, the Sun was not yet visible.

And in order for the Sun to have been entirely shielded by an impenetrable terrestrial\natmosphere, its substantiality would have had to have been denser than that of Venus. Ven-\nerian-like pressures at Earth\u2019s surface, let alone an even greater burden, would not have al-\nlowed the survival of terrestrial mammals including the human race.\n\nAt bottom lies this additional fact: While the axes of the Solar System planets point in\ndifferent directions, those of Saturn and Earth come close to coinciding. Saturn is tilted at\n26.7 degrees while Earth\u2019s tilt is at 23.45 degrees.'* Both axes point to about the same spot\nin space. Saturn\u2019s present north star is the same as Earth\u2019s\u2014Polaris. This is a situation that\nwould be expected had Saturn and Earth once shared the same axis of rotation as our main\nthesis demands. What this seems to indicate is that, despite Delair\u2019s assurance to the contrary,\nEarth\u2019s present axial tilt is the most natural one for it to possess, and that it has not changed\nsince at least the Tertiary period.\n\nWhat then of a perpendicular axis with an Earth in phase-lock outside the Solar System\nas posited by Ken Croswell for red dwarf planets? This, too, fails to fill the bill because, as\nwe have already noted, while Croswell\u2019s theoretical system would entail a world without\nvariable seasons, it does not occasion one universal spring-like climate. True enough, the\nclimate would not have been variable, but tropical and equatorial regions would still have\nbeen much warmer than the poles. The poles, in fact, would have been the recipients of low\nslanting rays and if such slanting rays from our own Sun would have been inadequate to\nallow the thriving of sub-tropical flora and fauna at the poles, neither would the slanting rays\nfrom a red or brown dwarf star.\n\nWhat if we were to adapt Croswell\u2019s phase-locked system by having it encased within\nthe totally warm plasma sheath we have already postulated for the proto-Saturnian system?\nLight and warmth would then have reached all latitudes in equal proportion without having to\nrely on an axial alignment, already posited as the most difficult mechanical configuration to\nmaintain. In other words, why not adopt Wallace Thornhill\u2019s scenario wherewith Earth was\nin just such a positional situation and that it only \u201cbroke\u201d into polar alignment when it\nentered the Sun\u2019s influence? This, then, would make the Saturnian system\u2019s axial alignment a\nmere transitional event, which would be more amenable to celestial mechanics.\n\nAs already claimed, the encasing of the proto-Saturnian system in a plasmasphere is our\naccepted tenet. In the end, however, it may even be found that both postulates\u2014a denser\natmospheric envelope and a plasma sheath\u2014are quite compatible with each other since a\ndenser terrestrial atmospheric envelope might have existed within the Saturnian plasma\nsheath. We would thus have a situation in which the light and heat from the proto-Saturnian\nsun would have been reflected back, or otherwise radiated outward and inward, from the\nplasma sheath and dissipated evenly through the greenhouse property of Earth\u2019s denser\natmosphere.",

This theory also\nexplained the resemblance noted by Heer of the Tertiary flora of Europe and the Re-\ncent flora of eastern Asia and Atlantic North America.\u201d'?\nAs Johnson noted, while Heer\u2019s theory dates to the late 19th century, his \u201cnotion of an\nArctic evolutionary cradle is startlingly modern, in line with the work of Dawson and\nHickey\u201d'\u00ae to which we shall come anon.\nE. C. Pielou, on the other hand, reminded her readers of photoperiodism which presents\nan \u201capparent obstacle to long, northward and southward migration of plants\u201d since such\nin \u201capparent obstacle to long, northward and southward migration of plants\u201d since such\nmigrations would have moved said plants out of their physiological niche.\"* Long-day\nplants, for instance, cannot survive in the tropics, while short-day plants cannot thrive in\nmore northern latitudes. This is because the photoperiodic length varies from latitude to lati-\ntude and from season to season. Because day and night lengths in the tropics approximate\ntwelve hours each all year round, photoperiodic variations are small to non-existent. In the\nmid-temperate regions, photoperiodic spans can vary from up to nine hours in December to\nup to sixteen hours in June. In the present Arctic regions, photoperiodicity drops to zero in\nDecember, rising as high as twenty-four hours in June.\nAll this, however, would have been of very little, if any, importance during the Tertiary if\nEarth had basked under a continuous and universal sub-tropical climate and light regime as\nseems to be indicated by the evidence presented above. In the case at hand, the climatic\nrequirements would have been close to identical the world over. Migrating plants would not\nhave had to vacate any physiological niches; they would merely have radiated into new areas\nthe climatic properties of which would have been near identical to the ones of their origin.\nIn the end, it is the available evidence that counts. Does the evidence support the theory\nof a Tertiary plant migration from the Arctic into more southerly latitudes? We have seen\nabove that Johnson claimed that Heer\u2019s nineteenth century theory of just such a migration is\nin line with the modern work of Dawson and Hickey. What have these two authorities to\nshow us?",

From the 1940s to the mid-1950s, for instance, Ting Ying Ma\nwas involved in the study of corals which led him to declare that the position of the equator\n(and, therefore, also of the poles) had shifted from one geologic age to another.! What did\nthese studies involve?\nVery much like trees, corals grow rings which are believed to indicate a cycle of seasonal\ngrowth; in winter, coral cells grow small and dense, whereas in summer they grow larger and\nmore porous. Ma noticed that the rates of total annual growth in corals in identical, or simi-\nlar, species increased with proximity to the equator, while seasonal variation in growth rates\nincreased with distances from the equator. This enabled him to correlate coral growth with\nlatitude, which furnished him with a technique for investigating Earth\u2019s ancient climates. It\nalso led Ma to two related conclusions: (1) That seasonal change was clearly indicated in the\noldest geologic periods, and (2) that the latitudinal temperatures of the past had been about\nthe same as at present. If this is correct, a world without seasons, as proffered in the preced-\ning chapter, could not have existed.\nWhat all of this conveyed to Ma was that, in the past, the position of the equator had\nchanged from one geologic period to another and that none of these coincided with the pre-\nsent equatorial position of land. One of these earlier equators was even found to have bi-\nsected the Arctic Ocean.\nThe mechanism for this displacement was then attributed to a sliding of the lithospheric\nshell over Earth\u2019s liquid core, like the loose skin of an orange sliding around its fruit. Ma,\nhowever, could not match earlier equators in one hemisphere with corresponding ones for the\nsame period on the opposite hemisphere in order to derive a complete circle. He therefore\nhad to assume that continental drift was also involved and that it was this independent shift-\ning of the continents which had thrown the ancient equators out of line.\nThese combined displacements, of which Ma could deduce four separate events, were,\naccording to him, sudden in execution and all in the same direction. He calculated them to\nhave taken place during the last million years with the last readjustment having been com-\npleted 65,000 to 2,800 years ago.\nMa was as courageous in advocating continental drift as much as he was in proposing a\nwholesale shift of the lithosphere.

The theory has now become dogma, proving\nsound Ma\u2019s utilization of it at a time when it was still anathema to do so. On the other hand,\nthe second half of Ma\u2019s theory, concerning the wholesale shifting of earth\u2019s lithosphere\nwhich, in any case, was the brainchild of Hugh Auchincloss Brown,\u201d remained in dispute.\nMa\u2019s theory is thus left reliant on his coral evidence. How valid is this?\nFirst of all, as Thomas Stephenson warned in 1959, long after Ma had conducted his\nstudies of corals, older accounts concerning the process of coral formation \u201cshould be read\nwith reserve, since the ideas in vogue on this subject have until recently been largely specu-\nlative\u201d and \u201ctoo much based on the study of the skeleton.\u201d\n\u201cIt is obvious that the skeleton is merely an imperfect if permanent record of the ac-\ntivities of the polyps, and study of the latter reveals the fact that in some cases at least\nconclusions as to the manner of growth, drawn from the skeleton, may be entirely er-\nroneous.\u201d4\nGranted that Stephenson was mainly concerned with the growth of coral reefs, the same\ncan be said of older accounts pertaining to the growth of the polyps themselves, as indeed\nStephenson makes clear when he refers to more recent studies by Matthai in relation to the\nformation of coral polyps.>\nNow it has long been known that corals are restricted to tropical and sub-tropical zones\ndespite the fact that, in \u201ccertain past epochs,\u201d coral reefs \u201chad a far wider distribution than is\nnow the case, their remains being plentiful in latitudes at which they cannot now maintain\nthemselves.\u201d\u00b0 Thus, while Ma\u2019s shifting latitudes could explain coral remains out of present\ntropical and sub-tropical climes, it has nothing to offer regarding their overall much wider\ndistribution.\nThe growth of corals requires an average annual water temperature of no less than 70\u00b0 F.\nThe polyps themselves, however, are insensitive to light. But \u201ctheir endodermal tissues con-\ntain myriads of microscopic one-celled algae\u201d which thrive \u201conly in the presence of strong\nlight.\u201d This makes for a highly successful symbiotic relationship since \u201cthe corals rely on the\nalgae to absorb their waste products.\u201d? Thus, both warmth and strong light are necessary for\nthe successful growth of corals and coral reefs.\nThe biggest problem with Ma\u2019s evidence, however, concerns the period of time repre-\nsented by a single coral reef which, at most, can be said to bridge a few thousand years,\nhardly enough to embrace a single geological period. Thus, for instance, as reported by\nCharles Hapgood:\n\u201cAt Pago Pago harbor borings were made down to the basalt underlying the reef, and\nafter estimates of the growth rate were arrived at, the age of the reef (Utelei) was es-\ntimated at 5,000 years.

What was worse for Ma, however, was the fact that he was not able to\noffer a cause for these wholesale movements of the crust.\nTHE ICE CAP MODEL\nIn the late 1950s, Hapgood picked up the topic of polar wandering due to Earth\u2019s sliding\ncrust and made a reputation for himself as the theory\u2019s foremost advocate.? Hapgood was\nable to trace the pole\u2019s shift from the Yukon to the Greenland Sea around 80,000-75,000 BP;\nfrom the Greenland Sea to Hudson Bay around 55,000-50,000 BP; and from Hudson Bay to\nits present location around 17,000-12,000 BP.!\u00b0 (Three concurrent paths and positions were\nalso given for the south pole.)!!\nNeedless to say, these polar shifts cannot account for the sub-tropical flora and fauna that\nthrived within the Arctic Circle during the Tertiary and preceding eras which have been dated\nto millions, rather than Hapgood\u2019s few thousand, years. Besides, the shifts proposed above\nwould not have brought sub-tropical regions into the Arctic Circle; they would merely have\nshifted latitudes by about 30\u00b0 which, today, would be like moving Winnipeg and Vancouver\nto the latitude of Ellesmere Island.\nHapgood was of course aware of this but, as he had to admit, it would be \u201cfutile to try to\ndetermine the location of the poles in the more remote cases\u201d since with \u201cevery step back-\nward in time the evidence naturally becomes thinner.\u201d !2 Even so, despite the scarcity of evi-\ndence, what the totality of Hapgood\u2019s theory proposed is that the region which is now within\nthe Arctic Circle would have earlier been closer to the equator, which would account for its\nsub-tropical flora and fauna, before it shifted to its present location. A neat package, as Al-\nbert Finstein himself had to admit. '3\nOriginally, Hapgood had contended that the cause for this crustal slippage would have\ncome about because the accumulation of polar ice is not symmetrically distributed about the\npoles. This maladjusted dispersion was thus believed capable of producing a centrifugal mo-\nmentum which was then transmitted to the rigid crust. As this centrifugal force increased,\nEarth\u2019s crust tended to slide over the viscous layers underneath. (This theory, the brainchild\nof Hugh Auchincloss Brown,!4 has also been maintained by others including Edward\nWeyer.!5) But, although Einstein himself was at first receptive to this idea,!\u00a9 he later ex-\npressed strong doubts about it, as so did Kirtley Mather.!7 The biggest problem here is that\nmasses situated at, or very close to, the poles produce minimal centrifugal effect.

Without necessarily discrediting Ma\u2019s deductions, Hapgood\u2019s results are not\nconcurrent. Within the past 80,000 years, Hapgood believes that the location of the\nnorth pole has changed three times in shifts lasting 5,000 years [as compared to Ma\u2019s\nfour displacements in the last million years]. The north pole, according to Hapgood,\nhas been in its present location for 12,000 years [as compared to Ma\u2019s 65,000 to\n2,600 years ago].20\n(Compare these figures to those deduced by Auchincloss Brown: 41,800 years ago;\n18,400 years ago; 11,400 years ago; with the last shift occurring 7000 years ago.2!)

Had it been a perfect sphere, it would tend to topple over, time and again, allowing it\nto tumble all over the place. Earth\u2019s spin, together with its equatorial bulge, turns our world\ninto a gyroscope. A shift in mass would therefore alter its orientation. The amount of adjust-\nment, however, is dictated by the globe\u2019s capacity to deform. Without such distortion,\nEarth\u2019s axis would at best have been capable of shifting by less than one degree throughout\nall past geologic ages. Thus Gold was forced to ask: \u201cBut is it reasonable to assume the earth\nis stiff enough to maintain its shape over long periods?\u201d2?\nAs Gold points out: \u201cThe present shape of the earth would not be the right one for a dif-\nferent speed of rotation.\u201d3\u00b0 And yet it has been assumed that Earth\u2019s rotation \u201cmay have al-\ntered drastically in the past.\u201d 3! This would mean that Earth would have had to readjust to the\ncorrect shape in order to maintain its equilibrium in space. In turn, this would also mean that\nEarth \u201cmust be capable of a certain amount of plastic deformation.\u201d 3?\nIf, then, a large mass was to develop at some intermediate latitude between the pole and\nthe equator (as opposed to one at the pole as originally proposed by Hapgood), Earth\u2019s natu-\nral balance would change, its axis would shift, and the world would have \u201cto adjust its shape\naccordingly\u201d until the extra mass finds its way to the equator.33\nFor one thing, however, masses cannot develop out of nothing. And, even if they could,\nas Gold himself admitted, the very plasticity that would allow Earth to topple \u201cwould actu-\nally let the extra mass sink in, and the unbalance would therefore disappear.\u201d34 How, then,\ndid Gold get out of this situation?\nHe did so by proposing that existing land masses like mountain chains, even though par-\ntially sunken, or floating, at different depths in the plastic material below, could change their\nheight, and so also their center of gravity, through erosion or diastrophism. This, too, ac-\ncording to him, would produce an imbalance which would have to be corrected by an ad-\njustment of earth\u2019s shape. Earth would then topple over gradually until it achieves a new\nstable rotational axis.35\nGold also believed that it is possible for Earth to have experienced polar shifts without\nhaving undergone continental drift; but continental drift could not have occurred without po-\nlar wandering.\nBasing his assumptions on Walter Munk\u2019s calculations, Gold came to the conclusion that\na period between 10 and 100 million years would be required for Earth to turn over by about\n90\u00b0.36 The time involved would be well within the span of Earth\u2019s geologic past.\nGold also considered the wholesale shifting of Earth\u2019s crust, in lieu of axial toppling, as it\nhad been considered by others before him. But while Gold believed this to be dynamically\npossible, he argued that such mechanism would still require \u201ca degree of interior plasticity\nthat would itself allow a yet more rapid turning over of the entire earth\u201d since an \u201cinterior so",

As he pointed out: \u201cIf the earth is deformable, the whole\nmantle should wander relative to the axis of rotation, but the implications of this are seldom\ndiscussed.\u201d4?

During these periods there have been\nmajor changes in the configurations of continents and subduction zones. These appar-\nently had minor effects on the principal moments of inertia, suggesting a relatively\nstable and slowly evolving geoid. Even a slowly changing geoid, however, can cause\na rapid shift in the whole mantle relative to the spin axis if the moment of inertia\nalong this axis becomes less than some other axis of inertia. This may have happened\nsometime between 450 and 200 million years ago...\u201d48\nAccording to Anderson, large-scale 90\u00b0 shifts can however also occur. As he continues to\ntell us, at present, the rate of polar wandering \u201cis much greater than the average rate of rela-\ntive [continental] plate motion,\u201d and it would have been \u201cfaster still\u201d in ages past.4? What is\nmore important to our study: \u201cWhenever there was a major continental assemblage in the\npolar region surrounded by subduction as was the case during the Devonian through the Car-\nboniferous, the stage was set for a major episode of true polar wandering.\u201d The southern\ncontinents, according to him, \u201call underwent a large northward displacement beginning\nsometime in the Permian or Carboniferous (280 million years ago) and continuing to the Tri-\nassic (190 million years ago).\u201d5!\nIf this was so, areas which were once south of Earth\u2019s polar regions, together with their\nfauna and flora, would have moved toward the polar regions. But, limiting ourselves to the\nlast 60 million years (which would bring us to the Tertiary), a shift of 8\u00b0, as expressed by\nAnderson, would not have been enough to shift sub-tropical areas into the polar circles, and\nthe sub-tropical faunal and floral remains of the high Arctic would remain unsolved.\nTHE PALEOMAGNETIC EVIDENCE\nIt is well known that Earth\u2019s magnetic pole and its geographic pole, that is its axis of ro-\ntation, do not coincide; at present they vary by 11\u00b0. More than that, Earth\u2019s magnetic field,\nand therefore its magnetic pole, is known to wander, having moved several hundred miles to\nthe north in the twentieth century alone. It has however been posited that, over a period of a\nfew thousand years, the field returns to its original position \u201cand that the average position of\nthe magnetic pole over the whole period will coincide with the earth\u2019s axis of rotation.\u201d>?

This \u201cfossilized\u201d magnetism\noccurs when iron-bearing rocks are molten and then quickly cool, thus trapping the orienta-\ntion of Earth\u2019s field at the time of cooling. Known as paleomagnetism, the orientation of the\nfield can be deduced if and when the original position of such rocks can be determined. If,\nthen, the age of such rocks can also be deduced, the orientation of the field, and so the local-\nity of the old geomagnetic poles, can also be dated. When this was accomplished, it became\nevident that the geomagnetic poles must have wandered over the terrestrial surface. More\nimportantly, the parameters enumerated above allows the path of the magnetic pole to be\ntraced through the ages and plotted on a map. Jean Andrews, among others, was able to trace\nthis path for the past 180 million years which she dutifully plotted on just such a map.4\nAndrews\u2019 research led her to the conclusion that \u201cthe whole earth (or at least the mantle\nand the overlying lithospheric plates)\u201d has (or have) tumbled.\u00b0> The cause for this, according\nto her, is the same geoid highs offered earlier by Anderson which cause an imbalance due to\nmass redistribution on Earth\u2019s surface.*\u00b0 This mechanism, which had been offered by others\nbefore her,*\u2019 is explained by Andrews through the following analogy:\n\u201cImagine a homogeneous plastically deformable sphere rotating in space. A dot is\npainted at the rotation axis, the sphere\u2019s north pole. If a bug placed on the equator\ncrawls sufficiently slowly (with respect to the time scale of plastic deformation) to-\nward the dot at the pole, it will in fact never leave the equator defined by the spin\naxis. Rather, the sphere will tumble, with the dot moving toward the bug, while the\nrotation axis remains fixed in space.\u201d 8\nOf course, following Anderson, Andrews was sure to note that Earth is not a homogene-\nous sphere while the equatorial bulge would tend to stabilize Earth and keep it from tum-\nbling. As she herself, however, retorts: \u201cNevertheless, the pole can shift through a large\nangle, even with only a small mass redistribution, as long as the bulge is \u2018plastic\u2019 and not\n\u2018frozen\u2019.\u201d\u00b09\nAndrews\u2019 findings delivered such an impact that the editors of Scientific American pre-\nsented her hypothesis as fact.60 Even so, the question has to be asked: What is the cause of\ngeoid highs and mass redistribution? What causes these areas of higher density? Together\nwith his colleagues, R. Sabadini is of the opinion that mass redistribution is the result of\nmantle flow instabilities,\u00b0! which is not really saying much.\nOf more importance to our own hypothesis, however, is the actual path of the magnetic\npole traced by Andrews for the last 180 million years.

All three of them, as well\nas the rest, are within the Arctic Circle\u2014that is these ancient magnetic poles were already\nwithin the Arctic Circle at the times supplied by Andrews. So that, even if her plotting is\ncorrect, all this pole-wandering would still not resolve the problem concerning the existence\nof sub-tropical faunal and floral remains within the High Arctic regions. As with Hapgood\u2019s\nearlier paths, the most extensive of these polar wanderings would merely have shifted the\nlatitude of Winnipeg close to that of Ellesmere Island. Somehow, I cannot see crocodiles,\nlemurs, and palm trees thriving in the present latitude of Winnipeg. Thus, as with other\ntheories of polar wandering, these pole shifts would still have fallen short of moving sub-\ntropical areas into the Arctic Circle.\n\nAnd then, how valid is a theory based on the hypothesized link between Earth\u2019s\ngeomagnetic pole and its axis of rotation? As already noted, Earth\u2019s geomagnetic pole is\nseparated from its axis of rotation by 11\u00b0. Nor is it even fixed\u2014it wanders around. In Jupi-\nter\u2019s case, the tilt of its south pole does coincide with its geomagnetic one; but at the north\npole, the geomagnetic and spin axes vary by 10\u00b0. That of Uranus is tilted a walloping 59\u00b0\nfrom the planet\u2019s axis of rotation.\u00a9? This was at first thought to be due to the fact that Uranus\nis tilted on its side. Neptune, however, is not lying on its side and yet its magnetic field is\nalso tilted a walloping 47\u00b0 from its axis of rotation. \u00a9 It cannot therefore be an inviolable law\nthat geomagnetic poles should coincide with, or otherwise be linked to, geographic ones, that\nis axes of rotation. True, Saturn\u2019s magnetic field is closely aligned with its spin axis\u2014being\nseparated by less than 1\u00b0\u2014but this seems to be unique among the planets of the Solar Sys-\ntem. Moreover, Saturn\u2019s magnetic field is stronger at the north pole than at the south (0.69\ngauss as opposed to 0.53 gauss), which is equivalent to the centre of the field being displaced\n2400 km north along the planet\u2019s axis. (Whether the anomaly of this magnetic field has\nmeaning for the thesis proposed in this work remains to be seen.)\n\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field is said to be produced by a dynamo effect involving its molten\ncore within the rapidly spinning planet. This mechanism, however, only seems to work in\nEarth\u2019s case. The core of a small planet like Mercury, for instance, would have cooled off\nlong ago; its spin is nearly 60 times slower than Earth\u2019s. For these reasons, Mercury was be-\nlieved not to have a magnetic field. And yet, as it was ultimately discovered, it does. As\nClark Chapman was forced to state: \u201cIn the case of Mercury, more than a decade of subse-\nquent thinking about Mariner 10\u2019s discoveries has still not yielded a clear understanding of\nwhat\u2019s going on inside the planet.\u201d\n\nOnly in the case of Mercury?\u2014one might ask. Take the case of Venus, for instance: If a\nslow spinning planet with a cold core, like Mercury, can generate a magnetic field, then Ve-\nnus, much larger and with molten iron in its core, should, despite its slow spin, also generate\na magnetic field. How is it then that its magnetic field is close to being non-existent?\n\nMars does not only have a weak magnetic field, it is said to be fading. At first, this mag-\nnetic field was thought to swing wildly from one spot to another so that future \u201cBoy Scouts\non Mars won\u2019t be able to use compasses to get around...\u201d But it was later discovered that the\npattern of the detected magnetism, imbedded in surface rocks, is not so jumbled after all.\nMore than that, the magnetism in these rocks is said to be \u201c40 times stronger than similar ar-",

To date,\nnothing new has emerged to invalidate this verdict.\nThe problem here is that if planets follow the same law, why such a potpourri of mag-\nnetic fields? If the dynamo theory cannot account for the magnetic field of all the planets, on\nwhat grounds can it be theorized that it accounts for that of Earth?\nIn the end it can safely be said that what Andrews really plotted was the positions of past\ngeomagnetic poles. Can it positively be surmised that these past positions ever coincided\nwith Earth\u2019s axis of rotation?\nBesides, as is well known, and as noted above, Earth\u2019s present magnetic pole is even now\nwandering on its own. So what need have we of crustal slippage to account for past magnetic\npolar wandering?\nTHE MARTIAN ARCHETYPE\nIn presenting his own version of polar wandering, Don Anderson had also drawn atten-\ntion to the other planets of the Solar System\u201d and zeroed in on Mars. He discussed what he\ntermed the \u201clargest known positive gravity anomaly on any planet\u201d which is associated with\nthe Tharsis volcanic area on Mars. According to received opinion, this mass anomaly has\nserved to reorient the planet with respect to its spin axis.\u201d Almost two years later, Peter\nSchultz took up the topic in the pages of Scientific American.\nAmong other matters, Schultz pointed to ancient networks on the Martian surface which\nare believed by some to have been cut by running water and flowing mud, which suggests a\nwarm climate. And yet these areas are found within 10\u00b0 of the southern polar ice cap. This\nparadox, says Schultz, \u201ccan be resolved by one simplifying hypothesis, namely that the ori-\nentation in space of the Martian crust has not always remained the same throughout geologic\ntime\u2014that the crust has shifted with respect to the planet\u2019s axis of spin.\u201d 74\n\u201cTf such is the case, the north and south poles (the points where the spin axis inter-\nsects the surface) would appear to have wandered over the planet\u2019s crust; certain re-\ngions of the crust that are now far from the poles would at some time in the past have\nbeen within the polar regions...[Thus] the Martian equivalent of plate tectonics might",

Suffice it to say that Schultz, as also Lutz, were\nsatisfied that polar wandering had indeed taken place on Mars.\u2122 As Schultz stated in conclu-\nsion: \u201cThe hypothesis that the Martian poles have wandered is supported by a good deal of\nevidence, and it offers new explanations for many of the planet\u2019s enigmatic features.\u201d85\nWhat was the mechanism offered by Schultz to account for this Martian polar wandering?\nThe mechanism he offered was a reversion to Anderson\u2019s proposed method concerning \u201cthe\nredistribution of mass within a planet or on its surface.\u201d8 His supposition is that: \u201cThe sta-\nblest alignment for a spinning object is the one in which the most massive parts of the object\nare farthest from its axis or rotation.\u201d87\n\u201cWhen geologic forces place a large mass at or near a planet\u2019s surface at a point far\nfrom the equator, the spinning motion of the planet becomes unstable, like the un-\nstable motion of an improperly balanced bearing or top. If the planet is not entirely\nrigid, the crust shifts to move the anomalous mass toward the equator. As the crust of\nthe planet shifts, the spin axis retains its alignment in space and the poles wander over\nthe planet\u2019s surface.\u201d 88\nEven so, Schultz was astute enough to submit a caveat:\n\u201cIf the lithosphere of the planet is very flexible, polar wandering does not take place,\nbecause any excess mass sinks into the surface before the crust has had time to rea-\nlign itself. There can be no polar wandering on a completely rigid planet either, be-\ncause the lithosphere cannot realign itself at all.\u201d89\nThis, then, would seem to invalidate Anderson\u2019s theory re the cause behind terrestrial\nwandering as discussed above and with which we are actually concerned. The case of Mars is\nsomewhat different in that the planet\u2019s lithosphere displays both rigid and flexible features.\nThere are ancient lava-filled basins that have been partly isostatically compensated together\nwith volcanic and tectonic regions which have not been compensated at all. Schultz\u2019s own\nconclusion, as it applies to Mars, is that the \u201cchange in mass distribution that is necessary to\nproduce polar wandering could have been provided by convection in the mantle (the rising of\nhot sections and the sinking of colder ones), by a redistribution of mass due to the impact of\nlarge objects or by the filling with lava of the resulting impact basins.\u201d\n\u201cConvection in the mantle\u201d would not, however, induce polar wandering on Earth for the\nsimple reason that, as Schultz himself warned, \u201cany excess mass\u201d thus produced would tend",

Wyatt Durham zeroed in on what has\nnow become something of a litany to the readers of this work:\n\u201cThe occurrence of palms and other types of tropical vegetation in northern latitudes\nwhere temperate or frigid climates now hold sway; the finding of elephants and rhi-\nnoceroses frozen in the ice of Siberia; and the occurrence of tropical types of shells\nand corals in Europe: these were the kinds of fossils that caused speculation as to the\nconditions under which they had lived and that usually led to the conclusion that a\ntropical or \u2018warmer\u2019 climate had existed where they were found.\u201d92\nYet, having reviewed the evidence he had at hand at the time, Durham could only con-\nclude his study with the following confession:\n\u201cThere seems to be no general agreement as to the causes of climate variation. Alter-\nnating intervals of high and low topographic relief of the earth\u2019s surface, variation in\nheat due to internal radioactivity of the earth, changes in the composition of the at-\nmosphere, variation in radiation from the sun, astronomical and cosmical changes,\npresence of large amounts of volcanic dust in the earth\u2019s atmosphere and variations in\ncirculation patterns are some of the causes that have been evoked to explain the\nchanges.\u201d\nDurham could have added the theories of polar wandering and the shifting crust, to say\nnothing of axial tilts, to his list; his conclusion would not have been affected. More than four\ndecades later, paleoclimatologists and paleontologists remain in a quandary as to the actual\nmechanism that would have caused tropical and sub-tropical flora and fauna to thrive in what\nare now the two coldest areas on Earth.\nDoes not our own hypothesis which posits the Saturnian sun, a former brown dwarf star,\nto have been permanently stationed in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole, bathing the northern re-\ngions, especially the Arctic circle, with constant light and heat, more readily fill the bill?\nWould not such a milieu account for the sub-tropical plants in the Arctic which, in tum, fed\nthe sub-tropical animals that thrived within the same region? Would not such a system, en-\ncased in a plasma sheath, with perhaps an Earth possessing a denser atmosphere than at pre-\nsent, have also ensured a sub-tropical climate in all latitudes, including Earth\u2019s south pole?\nWould not this also account for the growing consensus among paleontologists that such sub-\ntropical flora and fauna originated in the Arctic from where they extended themselves farther\nsouth? Wandering poles would not then be called for; neither would a shifting crust or a\ntilting of the axis.",

We are also\naware that this supposition is open to the greatest criticism.\u201d\nSince then, I have continued to refer to the Saturnian system, model, and scenario as be-\ning bizarre in the extreme.\nThe problem did not merely consist of the fact that there were no such coupled bodies\nknown from anywhere in the Universe, let alone in the Solar System; it also consisted of the\nsupposition that celestial mechanics, as then known, would not allow for such a coupling. An\nadded problem was the fact that, in the 1970s, neither of the two main proponents of the Sat-\nurn theory, David Talbott and myself, were experts in celestial mechanics. Thus, when John\nGibson asked Talbott in an interview whether he thought that any astrophysicist could possi-\nbly accept the Saturn theory, Talbott replied with the words:\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, I\u2019m going to go ahead...and not even worry about the physics of\nit all. Let\u2019s face it: within any established frame of thought the whole thing is hilari-\nous. How could two planets rotate on the same axis in any stable configura-\ntion...Does that sound like something one could defend in any terms acceptable to\nmodern astronomy?\u201d3\nAnd, when Gibson came close to insisting that Talbott \u201cshould suggest some physical\nprinciple which might account for the planetary configuration\u201d he was describing, Talbott\nemphatically replied with: \u201cNo, absolutely not.\u201d And added: \u201cThat would only make things\nworse. I\u2019m not a physicist.\u201d4\nNot happy with Talbott\u2019s decision to avoid any attempt to solve the problem, I decided to\naccost some orthodox authorities with this mechanical conundrum. Five of them promised to\nlook into the matter despite their obvious disbelief, although they all compelled me to keep\ntheir names out of the literature, at least until such time as their endeavors showed any",

Since I have never been released\nfrom this pledge, I remain unconditionally bound to safeguard their identity and reputation to\nthis day even though, as of this writing, they have all passed away but one.\n\nOver the years some calculations petered in but, without exception, they all involved\nsome amendment of the model they were meant to quantify. This was not much help since no\nproblem can be solved through its own modification. The answer to a question is unaccept-\nable if the question itself is altered. When I pointed this out, I was lectured on the scientific\nmethod and told I was being stubborn. In the end, the verdict was that my model was physi-\ncally impossible. The argument that Wegener\u2019s model of shifting continents was also once\nthought to be impossible went unheeded. My five staunch mechanists deserted me, leaving\nme with a pile of impressive calculations that explained everything except what I had wanted\nthem to explain.\n\nBOLD ENDEAVORS\n\nThroughout the years there were various bold endeavors, and even a few competing theo-\nries, all vying to resolve the axial and other dilemmas of the Saturnian, or Saturnian-like,\nconfiguration. There would be no point, however, in detailing these efforts although fairness\ndemands that they should at least be mentioned.\n\nAmong those with a competing theory was the analytical chemist, Frederic Jueneman,\nwhom we have met on several occasions in the past pages of this work. Contrary to the thesis\nbeing presented here, Jueneman opted for the planet Mars as having been the immobile bo-\nreal sun of which the mytho-historical record speaks.>\n\nThere was also Earl Milton, a spectroscopist working out of the department of Physics at\nthe University of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. Having already questioned the presently ac-\ncepted tenets of astrophysics, he did not see the axial coupling of Earth with proto-Saturn as\nan insoluble problem but simply as one concerning a scheme with which he did not entirely\nagree.\u00a9 This was not to be wondered at because he, also, had been working on a model of his\nown. This was based on a scenario reconstructed by his colleague, Alfred de Grazia. Unfor-\ntunately, while de Grazia acknowledged the universality of the mytho-historical record, he\nshowed a distinct penchant for using Greek sources as the yard-stick against which to meas-\nure his cosmic scheme. Thus, de Grazia saw it as imperative to accommodate the Greek gen-\neration of gods in which each deity was considered to have been the offspring of the preced-\ning one. In following Immanuel Velikovsky, who had interpreted the birth of Athena from\nthe head of Zeus as the actual ejection of the planet Venus from the planet Jupiter, de Grazia\ndeceived himself into believing that, similarly, the ejection of one planet from another has to\nbe implied by all such divine births.\u2019? And Milton, unfortunately, followed suit. This resulted\nin a hypothesized sequence of planetary fissionings and ejections\u2014 Uranus and Saturn from\nwhat Milton and de Grazia termed super-Uranus, Jupiter from Saturn and, finally, still fol-\nlowing Velikovsky, Venus from Jupiter.",

According to this scheme, Saturn and Earth would have rotated on their\nsingle axis \u201cextending out from Jupiter.\u201d This would have meant that, from the vantage point\nof Earth, Jupiter would have been hidden behind Saturn and thus not visible to Earth-bound\nobservers. !!\n\nRight from the start, the above scheme did not sit well with me because I had not come\nacross anything in the mythic record that could be made to account for this hidden aspect of\nthe planet Jupiter or any god identifiable as such. And, as of this writing, Talbott has yet to\npresent the evidence on which he continues to base this particular hypothesis.\n\nI, on the other hand, had toyed with the idea of placing Jupiter at the other end of the con-\nfiguration with Earth stationed in between the two giant planets. Thus Jupiter would have ap-\npeared stationary in Earth\u2019s south polar sky. Such a configuration, or so I reasoned at the\ntime, would have lessened the instability problem since Earth would have been\ngravitationally attracted to both giants without succumbing to either. !2 This idea had been\nfed fuel by a few mythological tidbits which name the planet Jupiter as the Star of the South.\n\nThus, in the Persian Bundahish it is stated how the \u201cseven chieftains of the planets have\ncome unto the seven chieftains of the constellations\u201d where the planet Jupiter is matched with\nthe constellation which the ancient Persians called Vanand.!3 Elsewhere in the same work,\nVanand is described as \u201cthe chieftain of the south,\u201d!4 which would make Jupiter the planet of\nthe south.\n\nIn Hindu astro-mythology, Brihaspati, which is the Sanskrit name for the planet Jupiter, !>\nis also linked \u201cwith the fire of the south.\u201d!6\n\nIn Egyptian astronomy of the Ptolemaic period, the southern stars were held sacred to\nHorus !7 who, as Heru-Up-Shetau!8 and/or Heru-pe-sheta (Heru-ap-sheta and/or Heru-ap-\nsheta-taui), was one of the names of the planet Jupiter. !9 In fact, among other things, Horus",

The title of the paper itself\u2014\u201cThe Plausibility of the Po-\nlar Saturn\u201d \u2014was such a positive statement that it made me devour its contents with childlike\neagemess.\nSherrerd had no apprehension about stating that such a planetary system was \u201cnot only\nplausible but likely.\u201d He considered that a linear configuration, with Jupiter and Saturn at one\nend and Earth in the middle, \u201cis a feasible and stable arrangement according to well-known\nprinciples of modern physics.\u201d23\nFurther research on my part, however, indicated that deities other than those identified as\nthe planet Jupiter were also associated with the south. For instance, the Mexican gods Tez-\ncatlipoca and Huitzilopochtli are both designated as rulers of the south.?4 These two deities,\nhowever, fit the role of Mars better than they do that of Jupiter,25 very much as Velikovsky\nhad earlier surmised.26 Worse still, in Roman mythology, Jupiter, like Saturn, was associated\nwith the north rather than the south.\u201d It thus became apparent that Jupiter\u2019s claim to the\nsouth, as also, incidentally, his claim to the north, had to do with something entirely different\n(concerning which, in order to keep events in a chronological order, I will have to write in a\nsubsequent volume). I was therefore left with no recourse but to abandon this line of\ninvestigation.\nDue to lack of editorial concurrence, Sherrerd\u2019s paper was never published. Nevertheless,\nthe barbell formation theory refused to go away. So much so that, in 1988, Talbott, too,\nthought it prudent to pay it some notice. As he wrote:\n\u201cMore than one physical model, in order to preserve stability (or at least a semblance\nthereof), would suggest a line up of planets in the fashion of a tumbling barbell, with\nthe larger orbs balancing the two ends of the planetary assembly and the Earth locked\nin polar alignment between them. On this theoretical principle I can express no opin-\nion, though applying the principle to the mythically-supported planetary line-up does\nyield some interesting results.\u201d*8\nBut since Talbott had alrerady opted for Jupiter\u2019s locality behind Saturn, he ended up by\nsuggesting the introduction of yet one more planet.

In the fashion of a binary system, it is accom-\npanied by the smaller Neptune, except Neptune is not stellar.\u201d3\u00b0\nRobert Driscoll, a physicist from Caltech, did not seem to give Neptune\u2019s participation in\nthe Saturnian configuration any thought. Whether he already knew of Sherrerd\u2019s theory\nwhich had suggested Jupiter as the other member of the barbell formation, or whether he\ncame to this tentative conclusion on his own, I have no way of knowing. But it is the Saturn-\nJupiter barbell formation that he saw fit to analyze through a series of mathematical-physical\nequations.3! This was encouraging, to say the least, because, for the very first time since\nthose physicists I had accosted earlier, someone had attempted to quantify the solution to the\nco-axial quandary inherent in the proposed Saturnian system.\nBut even here, there were still some problems.\nAccording to Driscoll, the Saturnian system came into being within the Solar System it-\nself when an unnamed gaseous super-giant went through nuclear fissioning, thus instigating a\nseries of minor calamities resulting in aerodynamic drags, shrinking and rounding of orbits,\nelectric charges, cancellation of gravitational attractions, centrifugal forces, the combined\ninfluence of which resulted in Earth being captured between Jupiter and Saturn.32\nThat, in brief, was Driscoll\u2019s theory. There would be no point here in presenting it in\nmore detail and/or reproducing its attendant equations since these would be beyond the com-\nprehension of most of my readers.33\nSeven years later, Driscoll returned to the topic in a longer paper in which he not only\nconsidered the barbell model with Earth captured between Jupiter and Saturn, but also, and\nmainly, Talbott\u2019s original, and still adhered-to, prototype in which Jupiter is placed behind\nSaturn. In this attempt, the aerodynamic forces relied on previously were eliminated, with the\nstability of the system now more heavily dependent upon the Sun\u2019s gravitational attraction.*+\nWhile I welcomed its greater detail and additional equations, I was less happy with this\nversion than I was with Driscoll\u2019s earlier attempt. Nor did a still further, but much shorter,\npaper by him, with yet more equations, add anything substantially new to his theory.3>\nTalbott\u2019s model, in which the co-axial Saturnian system is made to orbit Jupiter equatori-\nally as a rigid rod, received something of a dubious boost from the structural dynamicist,\nRobert Grubaugh, who specialized in placing satellites into orbit.%\u00b0 In this scheme, the two",

Several calculations were performed by\nGrubaugh to \u201cdemonstrate that the alignment is feasible according to the laws of Newtonian\ngravitation, and that the magnitude of torque necessary to produce the required precession is\nwithin the realm of possibility.\u201d Once again, it is not necessary to reproduce these calcula-\ntions here and interested parties are asked to consult the original documents cited.\n\nWhile no other physical model of the Saturnian configuration had until then received as\nmuch attention as Grubaugh\u2019s proposed model did, it had its ups and downs. In the end,\neven Talbott, at whose instigation Grubaugh had patterned his hypothesis, discovered a flaw\nin Grubaugh\u2019s model, although it was not one affecting his calculations. What Talbott real-\nized is that, physically verifiable as it may be, Grubaugh\u2019s model did not conform to his own\nscenario as he had constructed it on the basis of the mytho-historical model. This problem\nwas also picked up by Wallace Thornhill.4! Worse than that, Thornhill also found fault with\nGrubaugh\u2019s system, and therefore, to an extent, also Talbott\u2019s, as a whole.*?\n\nIn 1999, Emilio Spedicato, physicist and head of Mathematics at the University of Ber-\ngamo, Italy, next applied his hand to the problem.* Like others before him, he, too, produced\nan impressive array of equations which, at least numerically, were found to be in agreement\nwith the Saturnian polar model. But, like others before him, he also envisioned the system as\nhaving resided within the Sun\u2019s sphere of influence.\n\nNevertheless, Spedicato did manage to show that, at least mathematically, the co-axial\nsystem would have been stable even under Newtonian constraints. He could not, however,\nvouch for the length of time the stability of the system could have prevailed.\n\nA year later, Spedicato teamed up with Antonio Del Popolo, an astrophysicist who was\nthen also at the University of Bergamo, in a further attempt to quantify the inherent stability\nof the proposed Saturnian co-axial system and, more importantly, to see how long the system\nwould have remained stable.\n\nTo the chagrin of some, the obtained results from the equations involved did not confirm\nthe required sustained dynamical stability of the model.45 On the contrary, it was found that\nthe stability of such an axially aligned system would be lost \u201crather fast, with its maximum\nduration corresponding to only about 3 months\u201d when its \u201cexpected stability should extend at\nleast over several thousand years.\u201d4\u00a9 Spedicato and Del Popolo did, however, concede that:",

His main criticism centered on what he deemed to be the gargantuan\ncataclysmic destruction on Earth that would have resulted during and after the break-down of\nthe Saturnian system.*\u00b0\nWhat remained curious about Ashton\u2019s recantation is that, despite all his objections, he\ndid not discard the Saturnian model or its accompanying scenario. How could he when he\nhimself had spent hours of research, especially in Sanskrit literature, and reams of paper,*! in\nsuccessfully verifying the model\u2019s basic premises?> In fact, in a 1987 paper of his which, as\nof this writing, has not yet seen publication, he stressed his belief that the so-called Saturnian\napparition from which \u201cthe metaphors of myth\u201d can retrospectively be derived can be con-\nsidered the very bedrock of myth.*? But then, reverting to the old canard that the identifica-\ntion of deities with planets is late, he convinced himself that the Saturnian apparition, as it\nmight have appeared in man\u2019s ancient sky, had nothing to do with planets. Apart from the\nfact that this is verifiably untrue, he seems to have forgotten that, in many instances, ancient\nrecords speak specifically of planets besides their corresponding deities, as shown in earlier\npages of this work. Even so, if not planets, what? What was it that Ashton believed was re-\nsponsible for the so-called Saturnian apparition? I quote directly from the paper concerned:\n\u201cTo abandon the planetary and retain the north celestial polar aspect of the primeval\ngods allows for an open and unbiased approach to the question of whether there was\never any original physical basis for mythical conceptions. Until the thesis set forth in\nthe course of this essay receives some measure of physical verification, it is still eas-\nily conceivable that the material of myth is due to subjective, visionary, psychic,\nmystic, metaphysical, cryptic, subliminal, or, if one can stomach the idea, occult fac-\ntors. This may be true no matter how neatly mythical motifs coalesce into one com-\nposite image retrospectively, and no matter how well the archaeological finds...may\nseem to attest that coalescence.\u201d 55\nHe was, however, obviously unhappy with this so, in lieu of it, he did forward a physical\nmodel of sorts, one which turns out to be even more bizarre than the planetary model he no\nlonger espoused. As he explained:",

It is seen in essentially the same\nform from points of viewing thousands of kilometres apart. It appears to be in the ro-\ntational polar space. It constitutes the central feature of the sky. The complete visual\nassemblage of it is that lost ancient sky which was radically different from what we\nnow associate with the sky.\u201d5\u00b0\nIn order to circumvent the problem raised by the invisibility of this hologrammatic appa-\nrition in the present sky, Ashton proposed that \u201cbetween the activating intensities of solar ra-\ndiation, there is an interference phenomenon which [now] blots out the polar apparition.\u201d5\u201d\nHe even provided \u201ca hypothetical instance of how this might work\u201d*8 but, as he made clear in\n1999, the entire exercise becomes irrelevant since he himself eventually disavowed it all. As\nhe then wrote: \u201cIn \u2018The Bedrock of Myth,\u2019 as yet unpublished, I explain why, by content of\nmyth alone, I reject the role of planets in the Polar Assemblage, which I think may well have\nbeen objective, but for which I failed to propose a plausible model.\u201d\u00b0\u00b0\nOne should recommend Ashton for his honesty but, since he continues to believe that\nwhat he terms the Polar Assemblage was the very bedrock of myth, and since he now admits\nthat the hologrammatic model he had previously advanced cannot be considered plausible,\nwhat is he left with to explain the apparition he continues to believe in?\nKnowing Ashton for the intelligent man he is, it remains my personal opinion that he\njumped off the planetary Saturnian ship a little too hastily and much too early.\nAll of the above attempts, noble efforts one and all, suffered through similar problems\nand, in one respect, by one and the same difficulty. All of them, in one way or another, were\nburdened with items which are contrary to what the mytho-historical records demands,\nand/or with items which, at best, are not contained within that record. To be fair to all con-\ncerned, most of those who had thus far attempted to solve the axial problem inherent in the\nSaturnian configuration were in something of a peculiar situation in that the Saturnian sce-\nnario had not yet been gathered together in chronological sequence in any one place. Worse\nthan that, not all of the events, with their celestial interactions, and their consequential out-\ncomes, had till then received treatment. Nor can the present work alleviate that problem be-\ncause, while a chronology of sorts is here being attempted, the history of the Saturnian sys-\ntem contains too many constituents, and too many events, only a few of which have so far\nbeen touched upon, to be told in one short volume. Add to all that the additional problem the\nabove theoreticians encountered in that they were already faced with slight disagreements\nbetween the main proponents of the thesis, and one can well understand the shortcomings of\ntheir attempts.\nThe one difficulty with which they all strained, however, was in their location of the Sat-\nurnian configuration within the bounds of the Solar System.

This mass would\nnot have been involved, at least not initially, in our alternative scenario where the co-axial\nSaturnian system would have originally sustained itself far away from the Sun\u2019s gravitational\nand/or electromagnetic influence. And this should not be wondered at because, despite Juer-\ngens\u2019 original concept regarding the extraneousness of the Saturnian system, the theory had\nnot yet received much publicity.\nBesides, as Talbott himself was astute enough to recognize, until all the mythological\nchips are in their correct place, theories concerning the astronomical workings of the Sat-\nurnian system must remain hypothetical at best. As he had it stated:\n\u201cWhat I will argue for is that the search for physical explanations have at its highest\npriority reckoning with the full implications of myth, wherever a definitive consensus\nis indicated. As more information is brought to the discussion this will require a con-\ntinued willingness to reconsider previous speculations\u2014with no qualms about modi-\nSying or even abandoning earlier frameworks .\u201d\u00a9\nTHE LESSON OF SHOEMAKER-LEVY 9\nThe problem then becomes even more obvious because, despite the internal consistency\nof the mytho-historical record, our theory continues to demand an astronomical solution. As\nalready noted, there are no bodies in the present Solar System which are linearly aligned.\nWorse than that, present Solar System theories, based on purely gravitational forces, even\nwith the refinements introduced from lessons learned through the detection of extra-solar\nplanets, do not seem to allow for celestial bodies to be so aligned. But then, in July of 1994,\nComet Shoemaker-Levy 9, which taught us more than one lesson, plowed into Jupiter.\nThe most important message writ large by this impact was more of a warning than any-\nthing else. It taught astronomers, once and for all, that Earth is not the safe haven they had\npreviously believed it to be. If a comet could collide with Jupiter, as this one did, chances of\na similar collision with Earth could not be as far-fetched as once believed. Geologists, of\ncourse, had long recognized the scars left behind by previous terrestrial impacts, but these\nhad always been pushed beyond the reaches of the present into the dim horizon of a long-\ngone past. Until recently, and despite the devastation it caused, even the impact of a fireball\u00ae\nin the valley of the Tunguska River in northern Siberia, in June of 1908, failed to alert as-\ntronomers to the dangers of cosmic impacts. Shoemaker-Levy 9 accomplished what the Tun-\nguska fireball failed to do. It sent entire nations on a world-wide program designed to keep\ntrack of near Earth-grazing objects, such as errant asteroids, in an attempt to forewarn hu-\nmanity of any impending cosmic-induced catastrophe\u2014even though no one seems certain of\nhow to avoid the calamity if and when such a time comes.\nThe second lesson learned from the impact of Shoemaker-Levy 9 had to do with the na-\nture of comets which, for years, had been touted as being mainly composed of ice\u2014\u201cdirty\nsnow-balls,\u201d they have been called, or \u201csnowy dirtballs,\u201d as some jocularly termed them. But\nwhen Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacted on Jupiter, no water was detected.\u00a9? Again, as in the case",

What this means is that celestial bodies can be linearly lined up,\none \u201cbeneath\u201d the other. If twenty-one individual bodies (the fragments of Shoemaker-Levy\n9) can do so, then so, too, can two of them (in our case, Saturn and Earth)\u2019 despite the dif-\nference in size and mass.\nJust as it was Jupiter\u2019s gravitational pull that was responsible for the fragmentation of the\ncomet, so also was it that same force which \u201cstretched\u201d its fragments into their now-famous\nline-up. It may therefore be objected that Shoemaker-Levy 9\u2019s linear coupling was a fran-\nsient phenomenon. True\u2014but it can no longer be claimed that a linear coupling of celestial\nbodies is physically impossible. Shoemaker-Levy 9 taught us that.\nTHE TRANSITORY SYSTEM\nFrom the very inception of his Saturnian scenario, Talbott had expressed his opinion that,\nlong before Saturn wed Earth in axial coupling, the Saturnian deity was seen to wander in\nspace. As he stated in 1977: \u201cA number of sources suggest that the solitary god wandered for\na time, but eventually came to rest at a stationary point, which is celebrated as the cosmic\ncenter.\u201d73 Later, and elsewhere, he wrote: \u201cIn the primordial epoch the creator first appeared\nin the Abyss, alone, wandering without a resting place.\u201d\u201d4 And: \u201cFor a time the creator wan-\ndered in the luminous sea but eventually came to rest at a point of stability...\u201d75\nIn this scenario, the axial coupling of the two planets would have taken place at the mo-\nment mankind saw their Saturnian deity coming to rest at his stationary celestial point. What,\nthen, would have been Earth\u2019s relation to Saturn during this wandering period?\nAccording to Frederick Hall, while Earth might have always been a satellite of Saturn, it\noriginally orbited the giant planet equatorially but, like the Moon in relation to Earth, the ter-\nrestrial globe would have been phase-locked so that one hemisphere would always have\nfaced its Saturnian primary.\u201d This was identical to Lynn Rose\u2019s model and Talbott, who\ncould not fail to note it, despite the fact that he objected to it, found reason to accept it as a\ntemporary condition of the developing Saturnian system. As he announced:\n\u201cThe simple scheme suggested by Rose may in fact add a vital ingredient to the\nmodel-building process. As noted by Fred Hall...there is terrestrial evidence that the\nEarth was once a satellite of a larger planet, rotating in phase with its revolution. And\nas I have, in turn, stated to Hall in private communication, there is a great deal of\nmythical evidence as well. Mythically, the key is the original state of the old sun god,\nprior to creation. The god, in his earliest remembered state, is \u2018inactive\u2019 or \u2018motion-\nless,\u2019 not in the axial or polar sense, but apparently in the sense of doing nothing,\nlacking activity or animation. This is the state which, in the myths, precedes the god\u2019s",

This has to do with Hall\u2019s elucida-\ntion of the transition from Earth\u2019s phase-locked equatorial orbit around Saturn to its later ax-\nial alignment. As Hall explained:\n\u201cNow assume this primordial, dying system enters the alien system of the Sun, even-\ntually encountering the Sun\u2019s largest satellite Jupiter (whose spin axis tilt\u2014or let us\nsay, non tilt\u2014marks it as a primordial companion of the Sun). As a result of this en-\ncounter, or perhaps a series of encounters, Proto-Saturn...is drawn in the direction of\nthe Sun\u2019s equatorial plane which, we shall assume, meant a northerly direction. In ef-\nfect, Proto-Saturn is pulled from the center of its native planetary system by a mas-\nsive force \u2018above\u2019 it, while Proto-Saturn, in turn, pulls [its former satellite, Earth] in\nits wake...\n\u201cUnder this obviously-precarious state, the usual orbital mechanics have suddenly\nbecome irrelevant. What, then, might happen to the Earth?...One of Saturn\u2019s power-\nful magnetic poles is now much closer to Earth and the other more remote. Thus,\nwhile magnetic forces are much weaker than the force of gravity [actually the oppo-\nsite is true\u20198], we have here a classic case in which they can be invoked.\u201d 79\nIn short:\n\u201cEarth is exposed to forces acting as a couple, with the near Saturnian magnetic pole\nattracting one of Earth\u2019s magnetic poles and repelling the other. As a result, the Earth\nis flipped over and is locked into a polar alignment with Saturn .\u201d\u00ae\u00b0\nTalbott\u2019s proposed temporary wandering of Saturn would then have taken place during\nthe transition period between Earth\u2019s phase-locked equatorial orbit around its primeval pri-\nmary and Saturn\u2019s eventual settling in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole due to its axial alignment\nwith the giant. As Talbott himself explained:\n\u201c{After years of research] I concluded that the earliest remembered condition was that\nof phase lock. That was the best explanation for the initial MOTIONLESSNESS or\nINACTIVITY of Atum-Ra, prior to...the wandering of the god as he looked for a",

I\nmerely note that, regardless of the mechanism proposed by Hall, what he described is pre-\ncisely what later happened to Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. And so\u2014enter Wallace Thornhill\nwho proposed just such an analogy.\nTo begin with, like Hall and Talbott, Thornhill was also of the belief that Earth originally\norbited Saturn equatorially.\u00ae? And, like Hall, he was of the belief that this earlier system was\nstretched into its co-axial formation only on entering the Sun\u2019s domain of influence. Granted,\nas already noted, the Shoemaker-Levy 9 event was a transient one. But, according to Thorn-\nhill, so, too, was the axial-coupled Saturnian system. To quote him:\n\u201cWe have seen graphically how an assemblage of orbiting bodies can become strung\nout in a line with the recent dismemberment of Comet Shoemaker-Levy [9] by the in-\nfluence of Jupiter. That model takes care of the polar Saturn configuration (which I\nconsider to have been short lived but spectacular.)\u201d\u00ae?\n\u201cThe break-up of the components of [Shoemaker-Levy 9] under the influence of Ju-\npiter may provide an object lesson for the formation of the Saturnian polar configura-\ntion, as compellingly reconstructed from ancient sources.\u201d \u00ae4\nUnlike Hall, however, Thornhill did not see Jupiter as the cause of the Saturnian Sys-\ntem\u2019s dismemberment. Instead, he credited our present solar primary \u201cas Saturn\u2019s gravita-\ntional sphere of influence shrank on approach to the Sun.\u201d As he explained: \u201cThe polar con-\nfiguration seems to have been a spectacular transitory arrangement between the break-up of\nthe original Saturnian stellar system\u201d and its capture \u201cby our current Sun.\u201d85\nAnd:\n\u201cIt therefore seems that the spectacular Saturnian polar configuration...was created\nwhen its planetary system was disrupted by the Sun in a manner similar to that when\nJupiter disrupted comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 into a \u2018string of pearls.\u2019 Such an arrange-\nment is unstable and, therefore, transitory.\u201d\u00ae\u00b0\n\u201cOnce inside the heliosphere, proto-Saturn would have exchanged charge with the\nsolar wind at an ever increasing rate as the charge density increased radially toward\nthe Sun.

As he then stated during an interview:\n\u201cWhen it comes to estimating the duration of the polar configuration, the best that can\nbe done is to look at the relative velocities of nearby stars. If we take, for the sake of\nargument, that the relative radial velocity between proto-Saturn and the Sun averaged\n10 kilometers per second, it would have taken proto-Saturn about 45 years to cover\nthe 15 billion kilometers to the inner Solar System.\u201d9!\nHe, however, also added that this forty-five year period was \u201cmerely an order-of-magni-\ntude calculation. As he said: \u201cIt could have taken much longer, but I don\u2019t think it likely to\nhave been much shorter.\u201d 92\nThornhill\u2019s minimum forty-five year period was better than Spedicato and Del Popolo\u2019s\nmaximum of three months for the duration of the Saturnian co-axial system but, when other\nparameters are taken into account, not by much. To begin with, as Thornhill\u2019s interviewer\nfound reason to comment:\n\u201cThe one thing that bothers me in all this are those 45 years. Okay\u2014so you say it\ncould have been much longer. Unless I am mistaken, however, I doubt that you would\nbe thinking in hundreds, let alone thousands, of years. And yet, Saturn\u2019s linear for-\nmation left such an indelible wound on the human psyche\u2014leading to the birth of re-\nligion, complete with human sacrifice, the scars of which remain with us till the pre-\nsent\u2014that it is difficult to believe this was the result of a short transient event. Would\n45 years\u2014at best a person\u2019s life-time\u2014or even a hundred, account for the universal\nmass of mythological material we have at our disposal concerning the event in ques-\ntion?

Meanwhile, the\ncelestial effects as viewed from Earth would have been so dramatic that it seems to\nhave completely overshadowed even the growing appearance of the Sun as this\nloomed closer. I\u2019m not able to say how long it would have taken for the Saturnian\nconfiguration to have had the lasting influence it has had on the human psyche. I\nhave tried to visualize the apparition in the sky, and I think it would have been psy-\nchologically overwhelming and disturbing. I imagine that all it would have taken\nwould have been one generation of exposure to that sky for it all to become \u2018im-\nprinted\u2019 on mankind.\u201d94\nTo say the least, this was not a satisfactory answer. As Jueneman, in agreement with\nThornhill\u2019s interviewer, noted, \u201cthe idea of a 45-year-long excursion into the inner Solar\nSystem wouldn\u2019t begin to impress mythological engrams on the psyche of the human survi-\nvors.\u201d95 In reply, Thornhill did hedge a little. \u201cThere are too many unknowns at present,\u201d he\nwrote, \u201cto pin down the duration of the polar configuration to 50 years, 100 years, or 200\nyears.\u201d But would even 200 years have been enough for the permanent scarring of the hu-\nman race?\nMy own main objection to such a short length of time during which the Saturnian system\nsustained itself in axial alignment, however, has more to do with the paleontological evi-\ndence than with the time required for such engraphic impressions. As detailed in a previous\nchapter of this work, this state of affairs stretched back into the remote past, possibly as far as\nthe Cretaceous Period, definitely as far as the Paleocene Epoch of the Tertiary Period. And\neven if one were to grant a reduction in time of these geological ages, there is no way in\nwhich they could be reduced to a mere 200 years. Even Thornhill would balk at that.\nThere is, however, one possible way in which Thornhill\u2019s scenario could be made to ac-\ncommodate the palaeontological data, and so I present the last tentative scenario before\ndriving home. I do so not to play the role of devil\u2019s advocate, but in an endeavor to leave no\npossible solution unaccounted for.\nAn original Saturnian system with Earth in a phase-locked equatorial orbit around it ala\nHall and Thornhill\u2019s hypothesis would satisfy the message of the mytho-historical record as\nwell as the palaeontological data if the present terrestrial north polar region would have faced\nSaturn. Under this condition, Saturn would still have appeared stationary in Earth\u2019s north\ncelestial pole providing Earth with the required north polar temperature demanded by the\nsouthward radiation of fauna and flora from the Arctic region. Earth\u2019s original axis of rota-\ntion would thus have passed through points in the present equatorial latitude.\nAt this point, one might even ask: Why not adopt this system\u2014which is basically Rose\u2019s\nmodel with some modifications\u2014and leave it at that? Would this not be more believable than\nhaving Saturn and Earth sharing the same axis of rotation?\nThe problem with this is that, in a change from a phase-locked system in equatorial orbit\nto a later co-axial formation, Earth would have had to undergo a series of drastic changes. Its\ngravitational lock would have had to be broken only to be re-installed in an entirely different\nmode; its orbital speed would have had to come to a halt; its axis of rotation would have had\nto shift by 90\u00b0; and its rotational speed would have had to increase. To all this must be added\nthe acquisition of an equatorial bulge due to the increase in Earth\u2019s rotational speed. Each",

They even belittle Ashton\u2019s previously mentioned gargan-\ntuan cataclysms, making it doubtful that life would have survived on Earth. It is not that cata-\nstrophic signs are absent from Earth\u2019s geological strata somewhere near the Age of Saturn\nbut, regardless of their extension, these nowhere show signs of the dimensions demanded by\nthe totality of the above mentioned terrestrial changes.\n\nAnd then, when all is said and done, why bother with this proposed change from one type\nof system to another when, as seen from Earth, nothing would have appeared to change in the\ncelestial sphere? After all, as seen from Earth, Saturn would have ended up motionless in the\nnorth celestial sphere just as it would have been prior to the change from the earlier system to\nthe later one.\n\nBesides, what is there in the mytho-historical record that can be interpreted in favor of\nsuch a change? As we have seen, Talbott is of the opinion that \u201cthe earliest remembered con-\ndition was that of phase lock.\u201d\n\nWhat led him to this?\n\nAs we have also indicated, still according to Talbott, a phase-locked Saturnian system is\n\u201cthe best explanation for the initial MOTIONLESSNESS or INACTIVITY of Atum-Ra\u201d and\nthat this initial inactivity \u201cseems to suggest the motionlessness you would get from a phase\nlock of a satellite to its primary.\u201d But, unless I have badly missed something, there is nothing\nin the mytho-historical record that differentiates between an earlier type of Saturnian inactiv-\nity or \u201cmotionlessness\u201d and a later but different sort of \u201cmotionlessness\u201d or inactivity. All\nthat the record proclaims is that Saturn and/or its anthropomorphic deity was motionless\nand/or inactive in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole. No change is indicated.\n\nIn his own objections to Talbott\u2019s postulate concerning the placement of Jupiter behind\nSaturn, Thornhill had declared that: \u201cThe principle of parsimony of hypotheses suggests that\nwe don\u2019t introduce another massive body into the system if there are no reports of it during\nthe transition of the proto-Saturn system from a primordial configuration into a polar con-\nfiguration.\u201d\u00ae\u201d Would it not, then, be just as parsimonious in not introducing a different Sat-\nurnian system since no indications of it can be inferred from the human record? Would not\nthis be in harmony with the scientific principle of Occam\u2019s razor which specifies that entities\nand events must not be needlessly multiplied?\n\nWhat, then, of Talbott\u2019s insistence concerning the previous wandering of Saturn prior to\nits eventual stationary establishment in Earth\u2019s north celestial sphere? As Talbott himself\nwell knows, this constituted a postulate which I had for long contested. In the end, however,\ndue to continuing research, I finally ended up accepting it. Not only had I been looking in the\nwrong place, due to some sort of blind spot I had even misconstrued some of the clearest\nmessages. As it turned out, and as it had been apparent to Talbott from the start, the message\nof the human record, in this case, turns out to be unequivocal. What, then, to make of this\nevent?\n\nActually, Thornhill had already supplied the answer himself\u2014but he disregarded it. As\nalready noted, when faced with the postulate of Saturn\u2019s early wandering, he presented two\npossible scenarios to account for it. \u201cThis could mean either that the pre-existing polar con-\nfiguration was disturbed,\u201d he wrote, \u201cor that Saturn\u2019s [satellite was] dislodged from [its]\nphase locked Saturnian equatorial [orbit] by the increasing influence of the Sun...and moved\ninto the polar configuration.\u201d While he opted for the second proposition as being the \u201cmore",

The Saturnian system\u2019s entry into the Sun\u2019s\ndomain, however, was a prolonged development that unfolded in a series of awe-inspiring\nevents. For a while of relative short duration, Earth teetered slightly off balance, and it was\nduring this precarious episode that Saturn was seen to slowly circle around its former station-\nary spot. The god wandered for a time. But Saturn was soon to reassert its hold upon its sat-\nellite and the deity returned to his former motionless locale. There is, of course, much that\nwent on before this temporary interlude, and even more that followed it\u2014but the detailed ac-\ncount of all that, complete with the relative evidence, will have to wait for the proposed se-\nquel to this work.\nThrough all this we have not been able to lay down our dragon\u2019s ugly head\u2014because, if\nthe mechanics behind the break-up of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 are not the ones we seek in\nexplaining the manner in which the Saturnian system could have maintained its axial cou-\npling, we are simply back to where we had started at the beginning of this chapter.

What is required is a means to keep such a formation linearly\naligned for a much longer period\u2014longer than 3 months, longer than 45 years, 100 years, or\n200 years. We need to discover a means to keep Saturn and Earth axially coupled for\nthousands of years, if not even longer.\nWhat, then, is the answer?\nCOSMIC JETS\nThe subject of the Saturnian co-axial system was discussed during the private round-table\nsession held for the speakers at the 2000 KRONIA Communications world conference in\nPortland, Oregon. At that time, the astrophysicist Halton Arp declared that linear formations\nare not uncommon in the cosmos\u2014to which he added the caveat that such formations are\nonly possible if given a long time to form. While this declaration should have raised eye\nbrows, it raised but little.\nWhen, a month later, I asked Arp what linear formations he had in mind,\u201d he referred me\nto the \u201ccondensations\u201d which had been discovered being ejected by galaxies.!\u00a9 These\ncondensations, as Arp called them, are now known to be \u201cviolent jets of plasma that erupt\nfrom the cores of some galaxies\u201d !\u00b0! in poleward directions. In other words, the jets in ques-\ntion are shot out along the axis of the galaxy\u2019s rotation. How are these jets formed?\nOnce deemed anathema to astronomy, electric currents are now known to exist through-\nout the Solar System. As James Peebles declared:\n\u201cNo one today denies the importance of magnetic fields and currents in the solar sys-\ntem and in its formation. This is now completely accepted.\u201d 102\nMore than that, as noted earlier in this work, 99% of the universe is now known to consist\nof plasma, an ionized gas that can conduct electricity.

The currents flow in\ngreat filamentary spirals toward the center of the galaxy, where they turn and flow\nupwards along the spin axis.\u201d!05\nIt is this model, according to Alfv\u00e9n, which accounts for the violent jets that are observed\nerupting from the centre of galaxies.\n\u201cEvery now and then [says Alfv\u00e9n], the electric current in a galaxy short-circuits and\ndumps a vast amount of energy into the core. The galaxy \u2018blows a fuse,\u2019 and the blast\npropels a jet of plasma up the spin axis.\u201d 10\nMost astrophysicists, on the other hand, claim that these jets are due to the intense gravity\nof a black hole harboring at the centre of these galaxies,!\u00b0\u2019 even though the existence of\nblack holes themselves has recently been raising some serious doubts. !\u00b08 But when it comes\nto similar jets expelled by a breed of new stars, to say nothing of the remains of supernovae,\nthe black hole explanation becomes untenable.\nThe Crab Nebula is the remains of just such a star which went supernova in 1054 A.D.\nThe explosion blazed so brightly that it was visible from Earth in broad daylight. Plasma jets\nsimilar to the ones seen ejecting from galaxies, to say nothing of a ring of hot plasma, have\nrecently been revealed by X-ray photography around the \u201cinner workings\u201d of the Crab. The\nplasma ring itself has been calculated to be 200 times wider than the Solar System. This ring\nis believed to be \u201cpowered by particles shooting along the star\u2019s magnetic poles\u201d which cre-\nate the twin jets that are seen \u201cfiring out perpendicularly to the ring.\u201d !\u00a9 An identical situa-\ntion has been found in the Vela supernova remnant. !!0\nThe same is true of young stars, which are now believed to form from gas and dust which\n\u201cclump\u201d at the centre of \u201can envelope of material\u201d surrounded by \u201ca swirling disk.\u201d Magnetic\nforces then \u201cdirect jets along the axis.\u201d\nActually, even our own Sun is now posited to have exhibited such bi-polar outflows,!!! to\nsay nothing of a so-called accretion disk, a remnant of which remains to this day as a circum-\nsolar ring of asteroidal dust.!!2\nBut what have these cosmic jets to do with Earth\u2019s axial coupling with proto-Saturn?",

(The jet itself is labeled HH 409.) HH 34 has\nat least five of these globular clusters all lined up in a row along the star\u2019s polar jet. The tell-\ntale \u201caccretion disk\u201d is also shown encircling HD 163296.\n\nHere, then, was incontestable evidence\u2014nay, proof\u2014that axially aligned linear forma-\ntions were not only possible, but actually existed in space. They line up along plasma jets\nejected poleward, sharing the same axis of rotation as their parent star, exactly as has been\nposited for Earth and Saturn in this study. Nor can it be said that these configurations are in\nany way transitory, as in the case of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, since they are believed to\nexist for millions of years\u2014and thus Arp\u2019s caveat re the \u201cvery long time\u201d needed for their\nformation. Moreover, rather than being uniquely rare cases, Herbig-Haro objects occur in\nprofusion. As of 1994, as many as 250 of such objects had been discovered,!!5 and more\nkeep being added to the list.\n\nNow if these stars can line up as much as five bodies in co-axial alignment, what is so\nimpossible about proto-Saturn having had one such body, that is Earth, similarly aligned?\nMoreover, as those who are already familiar with the Saturn thesis know, and as I intend to\nshow in future sequels, Proto-Saturn eventually ended up having at least three planetary\nbodies co-axially aligned. Thus, whatever keeps the bodies in Herbig-Haro jets axially\naligned would also have kept Saturn and Earth (to say nothing of later planets) in similar\nalignment.\n\nWhat I must stress here is that all this is not to say that the Saturnian system was a Her-\nbig-Haro object, the immense masses and distances of which alone would preclude such an\nidentity. What is being hypothesized is that the Saturnian system can be visualized to have\nbeen a scaled down version of such an \u201cobject,\u201d concerning which more will be revealed in\nour final chapter.\n\nAt this crucial point, however, the following question presents itself: Did proto-Saturn\ndisplay jets?",

As we have seen,\nthe deity named Elohim is to be understood as a personification of the planet Saturn. We\nhave also seen that the waters referred to were celestial in nature and that these can perhaps\nbe best understood as a circumstellar cloud surrounding the proto-planet in question. What,\nthen, could it mean that the spirit of Saturn moved over the face of these waters?\nThe Hebrew word translated as \u201cspirit\u201d is ruach, a word which has the additional mean-\ning of \u201cwind.\u201d We find the same situation in Arabic, as also in Maltese, where the words for\n\u201cspirit,\u201d or \u201csoul,\u201d and \u201cwind\u201d share the same linguistic root: rih for \u201csoul\u201d and/or \u201cspirit,\u201d\nrih for \u201cwind.\u201d And, in fact, the Hebrew Talmud does not \u201cconceive\u201d of ruach as God\u2019s\nspirit, but as God\u2019s wind.2 True, Louis Ginzberg warns that this was \u201ccertainly\u201d due \u201cto an\nanti-Christian tendency, since the Christians identified God\u2019s spirit with the Holy Ghost\u201d\nwith which the Jews do not comply. Perhaps. There is no denying, however, that ruach is the\nusual word used for \u201cwind\u201d in the entire Old Testament, including Genesis. It therefore\nseems more probable that the reason ruach was translated as \u201cspirit\u201d in the second verse of\nthis particular Book stems from the fact that the \u201cspirit\u201d of Elohim (usually translated as\n\u201cGod\u201d) seemed to make better sense than \u201cwind\u201d to those who had lost the original meaning\nbehind the verse. James Strong additionally tells us that ruach can also be interpreted as\n\u201cwhirlwind,\u201d4 a datum we shall not lose track of.\nWe find the same idea expressed in the Gnostic words of the Sethians according to\nHippolytus: \u201cNow from the water there has come, as a first derivative principle, a fierce and\nviolent wind which is the cause of all generation.\u201d5\nOut of Indic lore comes an echo of the same phenomenon. As related in the Hymn of Na-\nrayana, this being, elsewhere considered \u201cThe Primal Lord,\u201d had \u201csat above\u201d in \u201ceternal\nsolitary shade,\u201d in \u201cimpenetrable gloom,\u201d before \u201cthings unexisting to existence sprung.\u201d We\nthus recognize Narayana as a manifestation of the primeval Saturnian god. It is then said that\na \u201cprimordial wind\u201d breathed gently over the \u201cvast expanse.\u201d\u00a9\nSimilarly, a Buddhist myth relates how the surface of the cosmic waters was \u201cstirred by\nRe at the very beginning of the Book of Genesis it is stated that, when eretz\nthe dawn wind of creation.\u201d\u201d",

But\nwhat was this whirlwind, this spirit, or soul, that seems to be so intimately connected with\ntraditions of Creation?\nSANCHONIATHON\u2019S COSMOGONY\nWe turn next to Phoenician, that is Canaanite, mythology. According to Sanchoniathon:\n\u201cThe beginning of all things was a dark and condensed windy air, or a breeze of thick air, and\na chaos, turbid and black as Erebus; and these were unbounded, and for a long series of ages\ndestitute of form.\u201d!\u00b0\nThus, as in the mythology of other races, the wind and chaos, the latter of which we have\nalready identified as Saturn\u2019s circumstellar cloud, had always existed.\nSanchoniathon, a Phoenician priest, lived sometime in the 6th or 7th century B. C. He is\nsaid to have copied the sacred inscriptions from the pillars in the temple of Melkart, some say\nof Ba\u2019al Hamon, at Tyre, when these crashed to the ground in an earthquake. His work has\nnot survived in its entirety, but Philo of Byblos, a scholar who was himself a Phoenician, pre-\nserved various excerpts of Sanchoniathon\u2019s work in his own Phoinikika sometime during the\nlast century B.C. As it happened, this work, too, was eventually lost but, once again, frag-\nments from it were discovered and preserved by Eusebius Pamhili, a bishop of Caesarea, Pal-\nestine, in A.D. 314, and incorporated into his own work, Evangelicae Praeparationis.\nAs others before me have stated, and as is obvious from the work itself, in part, San-\nchoniathon\u2019s cosmogony resembles that of the Babylonians while heavily influenced by\nGreek and Jewish sources,!! if not also those of Egypt.!2 Thus, for instance, when he claims\nthat chaos was as \u201cblack as Erebus,\u201d he literally means \u201cdarkness,\u201d Erebus being the dark\nGreek Limbo said to have been situated between Earth and Hades.\nIt might not have been fair for George Cook to state that Sanchoniathon\u2019s cosmogony\ncannot be taken seriously \u201cas an account of genuine Phoenician beliefs.\u201d3 As he himself\nstated:\n\u201cAt the same time Philo [and, therefore, Sanchoniathon] did not invent all the non-\nsense which he has handed down; he drew upon various sources, Greek and Egyptian,\nsome of them ultimately of Babylonian origin, and incidentally, he mentions matters\nof interest which, when tested by other evidence, are fairly well supported. He shows\nat any rate that some sort of a theology existed in his day...\u201d 4",

Not wishing to leave any of his data unaccounted for,\nhe seems to have gathered disparate myths which recounted the same events and presented\nthem as different occurrences in a chronological succession.\nAs Sanchoniathon continues:\n\u201cBut when this wind became enamored of its own first principles (the chaos), an in-\ntimate union took place, that connection was called Pothos; and it was the beginning\nof the creation of all things. And it (the chaos) knew not its own production; but from\nits embrace with the wind was generated Mot, which some call Ilus, but others, the\nputrefaction of a watery mixture.\u201d !5\nAs I have attempted to show in a previous chapter, this mot was considered by some as\nslime and, by others, as a rotting of aquatic composition.'\u00a9 As there noted, modern scholars\nhave supported the interpretation of this word as \u201cwater.\u201d !7 But since this celestial water was\nobviously the same, or of the same nature, as the chaos which surrounded proto-Saturn as a\ncircumstellar cloud, it also becomes obvious that this is one of those occasions in which San-\nchoniathon fused two variant readings of the same event into a sequential one. (There are\nothers, but these do not concern us here.)\nAs shown above, Sanchoniathon also claimed that some called Mot by the name Ilus. To\nus, this has interest since, elsewhere, he himself informs us that Ilus was merely the Phoeni-\ncian form of the Greek Cronus!\u00ae (or Kronos), the same as El. Knowing full well by now\nwhom Kronos and El represented, we again come face to face with the association of these\nearly events with the planet Saturn.\nBOREAS\nWe again find this wind associated with a Saturnian deity, in this case Atum, in Egyptian\nmythology. More than that, this wind is there described as having been a north wind, said to\nhave come from Atum.!9 So, likewise, with Ra (or Re), who is beseeched to \u201cinhale the north\nwind.\u201d20 In the Pyramid Texts, this north wind is said to \u201clift up\u201d the deceased king in his\nassimilation to the god.?! A \u201clifting up,\u201d in turn, connotes a support, another datum we shall\nnot lose track of.\nWe meet this same north wind in the mythology of ancient Greece where the entity in\nquestion was anthropomorphosed as Aquilo, more popularly known as Boreas. Although\nGreek mythology encompasses four anthropomorphosed wind entities\u2014Boreas, Zephyros,\nNotus, and Eurus\u2014it is Boreas that holds the centre stage. It is, in fact, from this Greek\nname, through Latin borealis, that the English adjective \u201cboreal\u201d is derived.",

Originally, however,\nBoreas seems to have been envisaged as a being with serpent tails for feet.?\nIt is interesting to note that, in the late third century A.D., Lactantius used Boreas as an\nanalogy of the Sanctus Spiritus which impregnated the virgin mother of Jesus.* As in the\ncase of the Hebrew ruach, this obviously stems from the much more ancient identity of the\nwind as the spirit of Elohim (to say nothing of the entity\u2019s fructifying power, which will be\nexplored in a future volume). In fact, as Donald Mackenzie indicated: \u201c\u2018Wind\u2019 and \u2018breath\u2019\nand \u2018spirit\u2019 were believed by many primitive peoples to be identical.\u201d\nBut, in the main, we note this fact: As a wind associated with Saturn, it is not surprising\nto find this entity linked to the north since that is where ancient tradition places both the Sat-\nurnian planet and its allied deities. We would, on the contrary, have been surprised had this\nnot been reported to have been so. Thus even in much later times, the Hindus were still\nassociating the wind with Dhruva,?5 that is the North Star which, as we noted in an earlier\nchapter, had originally been one of the Sanskrit names for the planet Saturn.",

As in the case of Boreas and his Egyptian counterpart, this\nwould again testify that the source of Ehecatl lay in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole.\nAt Chichen Itza, in Mexico, there is a circular pre-Columbian building which the Ameri-\ncan explorer John Lloyd Stephens named El Caracol\u2014\u201cThe Snail.\u201d This edifice contains an\ninterior spiral staircase which leads to a round observatory oriented to the four cardinal points\nof the compass. As Neil Baldwin explains:\n\u201cThe Snail building is an important signpost on our Plumed Serpent trail for several\nreasons. The round shape of the building links it to the chain of structures throughout\nMesoamerica consecrated to Ehecatl, the Wind God, one of Plumed Serpent\u2019s per-\nsonalities.\u201d3!\nEl Caracol was aptly named since its interior winding staircase is reminiscent of the\ncoiling shell of the snail. We find this same spiral coiling in the outer ramparts of the\nstrangely shaped structure at Calixtlahuaca, which was also dedicated to Ehecatl. Among the\nMaya, this god was known as Kukulkan, one aspect of whom was also that of wind god.*? It\nis thus fitting that, in a curious Maya vase, Kukulkan is symbolically shown emerging from a\nsnail.33 It was, however, the conch shell, rather than the snail, which was intimately\nassociated with Ehecatl. As Tom Lowenstein has it:\n\u201c...in his guise as Ehecatl, the Plumed Serpent [that is, Quetzalcoatl] wore a conch\nshell, his symbolic \u2018jewel of the wind.\u2019 In imitation of their deity himself, priests of",

Many of the temples\ndedicated to Quetzalcoatl were also circular, signifying the eddying of the wind.\u201d34\nThe spiral on the shell of a snail, as well as the interior construction of the conch, both\nsymbolic of Ehecatl as the god of wind,35 are more significant of a whirlwind than an ordi-\nnary breeze. This is so much so that, among the punishments which Quetzalcoatl was be-\nlieved to inflict on the human race were tornadoes and water spouts.3\u00a2 Tornadoes and water\nspouts exhibit a verticality stretching between heaven and Earth, much in the manner exem-\nplified by the various wind entities we have been examining. Thus, for instance, in the Vi-\nenna Codex, Quetzalcoatl-Ehecatl is depicted with arms raised to support the sky.37\nSHU\nThe above cannot but remind us of the Egyptian god Shu, who was said to have flowed\nfrom Ra,38 but by others as having been self-created.39 He was, in effect, the very breath of\nRa. Like Ehecatl, Shu was described, and profusely depicted, as holding up the \u201csky.\u201d4!\nAdditionally, like Boreas, he was also considered to have been the personification of the\nnorth wind.* Rather than separating the celestial waters from the terrestrial ones, as in the\ncase of Ehecatl and Elohim, Shu was said to have separated heaven from Earth.43\nThe very name Shu has been interpreted as \u201cthe uplifter.\u201d4 As the uplifter of heaven, he\nbecomes its support. As Budge informs us, Shu was also considered \u201ca god of light, or light\npersonified.\u201d45 But light in this instance was also \u201cdeclared to be the prop of the sky.\u201d46\nActually, the character of Shu is much more complex than that and, to be sure, he has\nbeen presented here somewhat out of chronological order. We will have much more to say\nconcerning this being in following volumes. I have merely included him here as a link in the\nchain of evidence concerning the nature of the primeval north wind in order to show the near-\nuniversality of this motif.\nThe most popular heaven-sustaining strong-man in the western world, needless to say, is\nthe well-known Greek Atlas. But, because I do not wish to step outside, or beyond, the\nchronological sequence I have been attempting to follow, his treatment, too, must be post-\nponed to a future work.\nIn the meantime, what all the above seems to imply is that this primordial wind was visi-\nble as an illuminated support of the sky within which the Saturnian orb resided. The only\ntype of whirlwind that could be seen to support the sky would have to have been in the form\nof a tornado or water spout, already encountered as one of the punishments inflicted by Quet-\nzalcoatl.",

        "content": "David Leeming presented Hurakan as an aspect of the Feathered Serpent, % that is our old\nfriend Quetzalcoatl. In the Popul Vuh, however, Hurakan and Feathered Serpent, there called\nGucumatz, are presented as partners in Creation. Thus, while we view Gucu-\nmatz/Quetzalcoatl as the embodiment of the Saturnian deity, it is obvious that Hurakan,\nwhile closely associated with proto-Saturn, was visualized as a separate entity.\n\nIn a recent work, M. Preuss had half a mind to identify Hurakan, which name she ren-\ndered by the Spanish spelling \u201cJurakan,\u201d with the constellation of Ursa Minor. This is in-\nteresting because Ursa Minor, the Little Bear, is the very northern constellation which con-\ntains the Pole Star, thus situating Hurakan in the very locality where the myths of other na-\ntions place the primeval north wind. Additionally, however, Preuss was astute enough to note\nthe connection between this deity and the axis mundi,55 the term used by mythologists to de-\nnote the boreal column said to have stretched between Earth and sky.\n\nOf additional importance is the fact that the name Hurakan translates as \u201cOne\nLeg\u201d*\u00b0\u2014which brings us to the next motif in our unfolding scenario.\n\nTHE ONE-LEGGED GOD\n\nAmong the ancient Egyptians, Osiris was said to have shone \u201cabove the Leg of heaven.\u201d\nWhat this indicates is that this \u201cLeg\u201d appeared beneath the Saturnian orb, represented here as\nOsiris.57 We also note that, whatever this leg was, it had the appearance of fire. \u201cHail, Leg of\nfire,\u201d was the manner in which it was invoked.*8 That this \u201cLeg of fire\u201d descended from\nEarth\u2019s celestial north pole, the proto-Saturnian place par excellence, was cogently argued by\nGerald Massey\u00ae and, as Talbott has shown, also by Hermann Kees.\u00ae It thus becomes appar-\nent that this \u201cLeg\u201d stood for a support which stretched from beneath Saturn\u2019s south pole to\nEarth\u2019s north polar regions.\n\nIn India we meet with the deity named Manu whose assimilation to the god Saturn had\nalready been noticed in the 19th century by William Jones and G. S. Faber.\u00b0! That this identi-\nfication is correct is borne out by Manu\u2019s epithet of Satyavrata, which is one of the many\nSanskrit names for the planet Saturn.\u00ae Moreover, as Jacob Grimm indicated, Satyavrata is\nthe Sanskrit equivalent of the Slavic Sitivrat, which is also a name for Saturn.\u00ae It is therefore\nnoteworthy that Manu was said to have performed a severe penance which consisted of being\n\u201cpoised on one leg\u201d for ten thousand years.\n\nIt is also stated in the Upanishads, that Brahma, whom we have already seen identified as\nSaturn, \u201cis only one-footed.\u201d65",

The African\nWachoga tell of the old god Mrule who...had only one leg...Russian myth presents\nthe demonic Verlioka as a...one-legged figure. So also was the Chinese primeval god\nK\u2019uei one-footed.\u201d78\nOne even finds this one-legged god among the Australian Aborigines, where he is re-\nmembered as Turunbulun.7?\nOne word of caution: There are other deities said to have possessed a single leg or foot\nwho do not translate as personifications of the planet Saturn, prime among whom is the\nMesoamerican Tezcatlipoca. But that, too, is a related topic that must await a future volume.\nTHE PHALLIC POST\nIn the year 2000, while exploring the Neolithic remains at the Nakovana cave near Du-\nbrovnik on Croatia\u2019s Dalmatian Coast, Tim Kaiser and Staso Forenbaher made a revealing\ndiscovery. Having come across a barrier to the cave, first thought to be a natural rock fall, but\nlater disclosed as having been man made, they penetrated beyond it to three natural cham-\nbers. Various shards of pottery, some dating to 6000 B. C., were found scattered all over the\nfloors of these chambers. The central room, however, contained a two-foot high stalagmite,\n\u201cunmistakably phallic in shape.\u201d Examination of this stalagmite showed that it had actually\nbeen formed in another part of the cave from where it was detached and moved to the central\ncubicle. Near the stalagmite was a trough covered with limestone slabs, which is thought to\nhave served as a bench, running the entire width of the cave. A three-foot deep pit was also\nfound nearby.\u00ae\u00b0 All of this marks the cave as having been a cult center devoted to the wor-\nship of the phallus.\nNatural formations of similar resemblance have long attracted the attention of primitive\nsocieties as well as members of civilized races. One such phallic rock, an artificially en-\nhanced natural formation, and now a prominent stop for tourists, is Kauleonanahoa, in the\nforest above the Kalaupapa Cliffs, on the Hawaiian island of Molokai.\nIt has, of course, long been known that phallic worship was an institution that stretches\nback into the mist of time.

This is indicated in the\npraises glorifying the god. As it was written: \u201cWho is this?\u201d And the answer is given: \u201cIt\nis Osiris.\u201d But, as an alternative, which, in this case, as in many others, boils down to the\nsame thing, the passage continues with: \u201cOthers, however, say that his name is Ra, and\nthat the god who dwelleth in Amentet is the phallus of Ra, wherewith he had union with\nhimself.\u201d85\nThe most popular ithyphallic god of Egypt was Min. Unfortunately, despite Ev Coch-\nrane\u2019s attempt to identify this deity as a personification of Saturn\u00ae and, later, through a\nchange of mind, as a personification of Mars, 87 not enough is known about this deity to reach\na definite conclusion concerning his genesis.\nAlthough at this point, as noted above, the inclusion of Shu would be out of chronologi-\ncal sequence, it is interesting to note that this god was inter alia lauded as \u201cLord of the Phal-\nlus.\u201d88 In the Pyramid Texts, he is actually equated with the male organ of Atum.8\u00b0 What is\neven more revealing, however, is the fact that, in some depictions, the heaven-sustaining Shu\nis replaced with the phallus of Geb. It is then evident that the phallus of the deity was itself\nbelieved to have acted as the support of heaven much in the same manner that the single leg\nof the god did.\nAs Diodorus reported, it was not only the Egyptians who consecrated \u201cthat member\u201d in\ntheir initiatory rites, but quite a few other nations.\u201d And, as a more modern authority noted:\n\u201cThe antiquity of the phallus as an amulet is shown by the number found among\nEgyptian sculptures. No visitor to Egyptian antiquities needs to be told this...The\nphallus was the most sacred amulet worn by the vestal virgins of ancient Rome.\nMoreover, we find that Sesostris of the early twelfth dynasty, who conquered Asia,\nset up memorials of a phallic nature among the people who had acted bravely...In the\nruins of Zimbabwe, in Central Africa, are to be seen phalli carved upon stone, similar\nto those found in Sardinia, which are said to be Phoenician...Again, numbers of\nphallic amulets in bronze are found in the earliest Etruscan tombs...\u201d\u00b0!\nMythologists have always assumed that phallic worship arose out of the ancients\u2019 recog-\nnition of the male member as a generative organ, and thus worthy of sacred honor as a sym-\nbol of fertility. Nor is this entirely a modern view, as evidenced by the writings of Dio-\ndorus.%2 That this is a logical assumption there is no need to tell. As an example, the lower\npart of a statue of Dionysos, at Phigaleia, was covered with leaves of bay and ivy. Arthur\nCook surmised that this was \u201cpossibly\u201d done in order to conceal the god\u2019s erect phallus and",

But what is of greater importance to this study is that the same Dionysos, still\ndecked with ivy-sprays, was elsewhere represented by a post dressed up as the god.% That\nDionysos represented an aspect of the Saturnian deity need not be repeated.\nThe nature of what this divine phallus really was comes to us from Phlius. There, a\nwinged aged man with phallus erect was once depicted on the gates of the city. This being\nwas known as phaos rhyentes. What is interesting, however, is that, according to Hippolytus,\nPphaos rhyentes was said by the Sethians to mean \u201cthe downward flow of light from above.\u201d\n\u201cFor there was a ray coming from above from that perfect light held fast in the dark, dread-\nful, bitter, filthy water...\u00b08 The \u201cperfect light\u201d from which this ray of light emerged was a\ndim remembrance of the Saturnian sun \u201cheld fast\u201d in the centre of its placental cloud, re-\nmembered here as \u201cdark, dreadful, bitter, filthy water\u201d\u2014the \u201cmud,\u201d or \u201cslime,\u201d or mot of the\nPhoenicians. That this was a reminiscence of the ruach of Genesis is then indicated when\nHippolytus continues by stating that this was \u201cthe spirit of light \u2018rushing\u2019 over the water.\u201d\nAnd since this ray was remembered as \u201ccoming from above,\u201d it stands to reason that the\nwater in question was also somewhere above, presumably in the sky, as our thesis actually\ndemands.\nIt was then this \u201cdownward flow of light\u201d from proto-Saturn and its placental cloud\nwhich the ancients likened to the god\u2019s single leg and/or his penis. In some instances, the god\nhimself was considered to have been nothing more than the phallus of Creation. Conse-\nquently, one of the meanings of the name of the Hindu Creator, Prajapati, is the male organ\nof generation. !\u00a9 More revealing is a passage in the Linga Purana which has been interpreted\nto mean that:\n\u201cPradhana, the primary unevolved matter, the cause of the universe is Linga itself. At\nthe root of Linga the creator Brahma is stationed.\u201d !0!\nHere not only do we again find a reference to our posited placental cloud as the \u201cun-\nevolved matter,\u201d but its direct association with the linga, that is phallus, as also with Brahma\nwho, as we have seen, originated as an avatar of Saturn. Curiously, in the Bhagavata Purana,\nthere is presented the image of a cosmic porpoise with the planet Saturn itself projected on its\ngenerative organ.102\nOf most importance is the fact that, in some cases, a phallus \u201csculptured in granite,\nmarble, or ivory,\u201d which used to be kept \u201cin the inmost recess, or sanctuary\u201d of Hindu\ntemples, was \u201csurmounted by a golden star.\u201d 13 A similar colossal phallus was presented by\nPtolemy Philadelphus to the temple of Osiris in Alexandria. This, too, was crowned in gold",

We may therefore safely assume that the pre-Islamic Samsu originally stood for the\nsame planet.

Thus, Elmer Suhr, who confused so many mythological\nissues, was nevertheless astute enough to realize that the primeval wind \u201cis especially effec-\ntive in the heavens at the top of the cosmic column.\u201d!0\nSuhr tells us that this cosmic column was \u201ca very old concept dating back to primitive\ntimes,\u201d and that it was the \u201csun\u201d on top of this column that created the wind \u201cby its whirling\nmotion.\u201d!07 Also: \u201cIt is especially important to think of the cosmic column not as a static post\nbut as a constantly whirling crucible, forever forming and re-forming the constituent ele-\nments into the changing aspects of human experience.\u201d !\u00b08\nThe memory concerning the association of this pillar with Saturn was retained in the\nChristian Sybyllines which proclaim that Sabaoth Adonai \u201cshall sit on a heavenly throne and\nestablish a great pillar,\u201d!\u00b0? which is elsewhere rendered a \u201cpillar of glory.\u201d!!\u00b0 Sabaoth,\nsometimes rendered Zebaot, is a name derived from the Hebrew tsaba or tseba\u2019ah, meaning\n\u201carmy,\u201d and is used in the New Testament as the military epithet of God.!!! Adonai, mean-\nwhile, means \u201cmy Adon,\u201d where Adon is a Phoenician title that simply means \u201cLord.\u201d !!2\nTaking their cue from the Canaanites, who were the same as the Phoenicians, the Jews used\nthe epithet Adonai to designate their own God. Thus it was said that when God asked Adam\nwhat his name was, Adam replied with the words: \u201cAdonai, Lord, because Thou art Lord\nover all creatures.\u201d !!3 As Louis Ginzberg has it, the name Adonai is \u201cthe very name God had\ngiven unto Himself, the name by which the angels call Him, the name that will remain im-\nmutable evermore.\u201d!!4 Moreover, when Moses is said to have asked God for his name, God\nis reported to have replied:\n\u201cThou desirest to know My Name? My Name is according to My acts. When I judge\nMy creatures, I am called Elohim...when I rise up to do battle against the sinners, I\nam Lord Zebaot...when I have mercy upon the world, I am Adonai.\u201d !!5\nElsewhere it is said that Adonai and Elohim were \u201cthe two sacred names of God,\u201d!!\u00a2\nElsewhere it is said that Adonai and Elohim were \u201cthe two sacred names of God,\u201d !!\u00a2\neven though, in fact, he was known by various others. This, then, tells us that, as far as the\nJews were concerned, Adonai and Lord Zebaot, which translates as Sabaoth Adonai, was the\nsame as Elohim, the majestic plural of El, that is Saturn.",

Reitzenstein claimed, under\nthe influence of Aion, Janus became the ruler of the cosmic axis. !22 This, of course, harks\nback to Ovid who considered Janus as the connecting link between the upper and lower re-\ngions, and said of him to have ruled over the constantly turning axis of the cosmos. !3\nThe Hindu Vishnu, too, was said to have been \u201cerected as the pillar of heaven\u201d in which\nform he protected the firmament.!4 \u201cThou proppedst asunder these two worlds\u201d is the man-\nner in which the god is addressed. !25 He is thus referred to as the one \u201cwho propped the up-\nper seat,\u201d126\nIn Japanese mythology, the sky pillar is compared to a reed. Thus it was written:\n\u201cAt this time a certain thing was produced between Heaven and Earth. It was in form\nlike a reed-shoot.\u201d!?7\nlike a reed-shoot.\u201d!27\nElsewhere in Japanese lore it is stated that:\n\u201cBefore Heaven and Earth were produced, there was something which might be com-\npared to a cloud floating over the sea [our placental cloud]. It had no place of attach-\nment for its root. In the midst of this a thing was generated which resembled a reed-\nshoot. ..\u201d128\nIn the Yuki myth of Creation, the sky pillar is represented as a rope. Taik\u00e9-mol, the\ncreator whom we have already met in association with the fog and foam that existed over the\ncelestial waters, is said to have \u201cstood on the foam, which still revolved.\u201d As it is said, and in\nkeeping with our hypothesis, there was no light at this time. But Taik\u00e9-mol \u201cwalked\u201d over\nthe water \u201cas if it were land.\u201d It was then that he \u201cmade a rope and laid it from north to\nsouth,\u201d129\nNot surprisingly, among the Kwakiutl of America\u2019s Northwest Coast, the cosmic pillar\nwas envisioned, and represented, as atotem pole, the name of which was Kalakuyuwish,",

The classical authors bear witness to the terror which this thought in-\nspired among the peoples of Central Europe.\u201d !#+\nCook has a lot to say about this fear, even though he confessed ignorance concerning its\norigin. This did not, however, stop him from offering an educated guess.\n\u201cHow that belief arose, we can only surmise. It may be that in the dim past, when the\nancestors of these tribes developed out of hunters into herdsmen and emerged from\nthe forest on to the open plain, they missed the big tree that seemed to support the\nsky...And in the absence of that mighty prop there was nothing to guarantee the\nsafety of their roof.\u201d !45\nCook can well talk about the \u201cbig tree that seemed to support the sky\u201d but, in actual fact,\na forest is made up of more than a single tree. Why, then, did primitive man not conceive of a\nsky prop that was composed of multiple posts? Why a single pillar? And, in any case, why\nwould this arboreal support have been visualized as the god\u2019s single leg, his erect phallus, or,\nworse still, a ray of light ascending or descending from above?\nSUHR\u2019S LUNAR SHADOW\nOther mythologists, needless to say, have not accepted Cook\u2019s explanation even\nthough but few of them have ever proffered an interpretation of their own. Among those few\nwas Elmer Suhr. He, too, speaks constantly of \u201cthe whirling of the column between heaven\nand earth\u201d 46 but, when it comes to his interpretation of the phenomenon, he stumbles badly.\nHis belief, of course, was that it was the Sun that rested at the summit of the cosmic pillar. !47\nHe even speaks of \u201cthe sacred disc of the sun\u201d turning itself rapidly as if this was a well-\nknown datum.!* As he tells us: \u201cThe sun, as it rolled or whirled through the sky, had the\npower to whirl other objects coming within its sphere of influence, and among these objects\nthe column of the cosmos was apparently included.\u201d!4? I hope I will not be accused of\nsplitting hairs when I claim that whirling is not the same as rolling, and that while the Sun\nmay be said to roll across the sky, it does not appear to whirl. And then, what would the Sun,\narcing across the sky, have to do with an axis which, by its very definition, had to have been\nstationary?

As he continues to inform us:\n\u201cMany peoples of the Near East and the Mediterranean area believed that the\nsun...was the primary source for the quintessence of life. It was the sun\u2019s light, re-\nflected upon the face of the moon, that brought fertility and life to the soil by way of\nthe whirling lunar shadow...\u201d'>!\nOne, however, is immediately bound to ask: What has moonshine to do with the concept\nof a sky pillar? And in what manner can the shadow of the Moon be said to whirl? Suhr ex-\nplains:\n\u201cAt the top, the column must have been in contact with the sun and the moon, the two\nbodies from which it derived most of its life principle...Of course, the two bodies\nwere not always directly above one another, but the sun in ancient astronomy was al-\nways exerting an influence on the moon from above, and both influenced the\nearth\u2014which made the columnar form symbolically suitable.\u201d!52\nAnd:\n\u201cWhether we think of the column as a shaft grounded in the earth or as the cone-\nshaped shadow of the moon, its lower extremity appears to penetrate the earth...\u201d 3\nHere, then, is Suhr\u2019s answer to this old enigma. According to him, the notion of the sky\npillar was derived from the conical shadow the Moon casts in space, which shadow termi-\nnates on Earth, during a solar eclipse.!54 As he pointed out in a different work, \u201csurely a\nnates on Earth, during a solar eclipse.!*4 As he pointed out in a different work, \u201csurely a\nshadow from a body ranging somewhere between the sun and the earth and making an occa-\nsional direct contact with the earth must have been, for the ancient mind, a projection of di-\nvine beneficence.\u201d!55\nvine beneficence.\u201d 1955\nAs we have seen, the real nature of solar eclipses was known to the ancient Greeks. To\nrepeat what we have said on a previous page, both Plutarch and Pliny knew that lunar\neclipses were caused by the projection of Earth\u2019s shadow on the lunar surface, and that this\nprojection took the form of a cone, which, as Suhr himself explained, would have been \u201can\nobservation based on what the naked eye could see\u201d plus \u201ca simple deduction from a law of\nphysics.\u201d!5\u00a2 As Suhr correctly deduced: \u201cIf the ancients were aware of the earth\u2019s shadow,\nthey must also have known, as Diodorus testifies, about that of the moon projected toward\nthe earth during a solar eclipse...\u201d157\nBut, while all of this is true, it can hardly be said that this was also known to our\nprimitive forefathers who would not have been capable of any \u201csimple deduction from a law",

It is therefore difficult to accept that the\nprimitive mind of ages past had already noted the extremely slow change of the pole, let\nalone that the change was understood. De Santillana and von Dechend were, of course, quite\naware of this objection, so it is not surprising that they attempted to overrule it.\nAs noted earlier, the discovery of the precession of the equinoxes has long been attributed\nto Hipparchus, one of the greatest astronomers and mathematicians of antiquity, who\nflourished sometime between 146 and 127 B.C. Yet\u2014or so the authors of Hamlet\u2019s Mill\nargued\u2014this does not prove that the phenomenon had not been observed prior to his time.\nUnfortunately, other than that their theory demands it, this premise is not warranted by the\nrecord and the authors in question must therefore stand accused of reading into that record\nwhat is not really there.\nWhat is worse is that even were we to grant that the phenomenon had been known since\nprimitive times, it remains difficult to accept that this extremely slow change, the perception\nof which requires thousands of years, could have given rise to a world-wide belief in the\ncataclysmic end of all things\u2014with flood and fire and the shaking of the terrestrial globe it-\nself\u2014as these authors maintain. After all, when one pole star is displaced by another, no dis-\naster ensues, either in heaven or here on Earth.\nMore important is the fact\u2014and the authors in question were well aware of this\u2014that\ncertain items of myth and ancient astronomical lore not only refuse to fit the precessional\nscheme of the equinoxes but, as we have seen, are notorious in not fitting anything else that\nwe presently witness in our Solar System. With the vast amount of research that went into\ntheir work, they were bound to run headlong into the ancient notion that the planet Saturn\nhad once played the role of pole star. Not knowing what to do with this datum, they ended up\nrelegating it to the limbo of unacceptable data.\nAll this has been brought up here because, needless to say, the authors in question were\nalso bound to run headlong into what they themselves termed the polar axis. So how did they\nattempt to fit this entity into their precessional scheme? Somewhat ambiguously, they tell us\nthat:\n\u201cThe rotation of the polar axis must not be disjointed from the great circles which\nshift along with it in heaven. The framework is thought of as all one with the axis.\u201d!58\nAs they explain on an earlier page, the axis mundi should be understood as \u201cthe equinoc-\ntial colure which \u2018accompanies\u2019 the slowly turning, wholly abstract and invisible axis along\nthe surface of the sphere.\u201d '!5\u00b0 By this they meant the imaginary line running from Earth\u2019s\ngeographical pole to the pole of the ecliptic, the centre around which Earth\u2019s axis revolves\nonce every 26,000 years \u2014in other words, the imaginary pole around which the precession of\nthe equinoxes takes place.\nWhat is highly interesting is that even they found this somewhat hard to swallow. As they\ntell us: \u201cThe abstract idea of a simple earth axis, so natural today, was by no means so logical\nto the ancients. ..\u201d160\nThat being so, why is it we find so many allusions to this pole in the mythologies of all\nraces and in such varied dress?

Why would\nsuch an entity have been thought of as a pillar upholding the sky, visualized inter alia as the\ngod\u2019s single leg or his erect penis? Why, indeed, unless it was something that was actually\nseen?\n\nBut what was it that our ancestors saw? What was it that could have looked like a pillar\nsupporting the sky?\n\nTHE WHIRLING RAY FROM ABOVE\n\nAs we have seen, the Egyptian Shu was described as light personified, which light acted\nas a prop of the sky. Osiris/Saturn was lauded as having occupied a position above the leg of\nheaven, which leg was described as a \u201cleg of fire.\u201d The Christian Sibyllines called the pillar\nof the sky a \u201cpillar of glory.\u201d We have seen that the rendering of the Egyptian Khu and/or\nkhut, the heaven-sustaining column, utilizes a hieroglyphic character which translates as\n\u201cvertical streamers of light ascending the world axis.\u201d Through Sanskrit, we have even as-\ncertained that this imperishable pivot, or post, was thought of as a fiery axis. The message\nseems clear enough: Although the direction of the light was interpreted differently by differ-\nent peoples \u2014i.e., ascending or descending\u2014what the ancients purport to have seen was ex-\nactly what Hippolytus described as \u201cthe downward flow of light from above\u201d and as \u201ca ray\ncoming from above.\u201d Even Plato had reason to describe it as \u201ca straight light like a pillar\u201d\nwhich has been understood as \u201cstretching along the axis of the cosmos,\u201d !6! while others have\npresented it as \u201ca cylinder of aetherial fire surrounding the axis.\u201d'\u00ae In other words, the phe-\nnomenon can be stated to have been a ray of fiery light which stretched all the way from the\nproto-Saturnian planet to Earth\u2019s geographical north pole, a pillar of light which appeared to\nsupport heaven and/or the proto-planetary orb of Saturn above it.\n\nBut why a wind? What was there in this pillar of light that lent itself analogously to a\nwind, even a whirlwind no less?\n\nAt this point one is bound to think of our posited circumstellar or placental cloud which,\nas we have seen in an earlier chapter, was inter alia described as a fog or foam which\n\u201cmoved round and round continually,\u201d a whirling \u201cprimeval void,\u201d a chaos which \u201cheaved\u201d\nand \u201cturned\u201d in darkness, the \u201ceternally revolving\u201d Tao of the Chinese, remembered by the\nDogon as the spinning and dancing Amma, whirling around while organizing the \u201cworld\u201d out\nof chaos, and/or the Norse Aesir who established their seat on the \u201cwhirl-field.\u201d Does this\nnot, in fact, accord well with Sanchoniathon\u2019s \u201cbreeze of thick air,\u201d to say nothing of Ehe-\ncatl\u2019s identity as the \u201cwheel of the winds,\u201d illustrated so graphically by the interior design of\na sliced conch shell which served as his symbol? Might it not therefore be that the analogous\nconception of the axis mundi as a whirlwind derived from its physical association with the\nwhirling placental cloud in question?\n\nIt is possible that the whirling placental cloud could have added to the analogy of the axis\nas a whirlwind but, for one thing, the circumstellar cloud would have appeared as a nebular\ndisk around proto-Saturn, and not as a fiery pillar supporting that orb. For another, as we\nhave also documented, ancient accounts seem to leave no doubt that the axis itself was seen\nto whirl\u2014and so has it been understood by past mythologists regardless of their blundering\nattempts in interpreting it. We shall have much more to say concerning the axis mundi and its\ndestructive whirling antics as it evolved through time in future volumes,'\u00ae but enough has\nbeen said here to make the point.",

Right from day one, David Talbott had understood it\nas a luminescent stream of falling debris.! One reason I could not accept this interpretation\ncame from the lack of recognizable cosmic material in Earth\u2019s Arctic regions. Let\u2019s face it, if\nthe polar column was really composed of material ejected from a stationary planet located in\nEarth\u2019s north celestial pole, and since the column is posited to have existed for possible mil-\nlennia, such constant bombardment should have strewn Earth\u2019s Arctic regions with cosmic\ndetritus.\u201d\nSince then, however, such material has been found in Arctic regions. Thus, for instance,\n\u201ca large fall of iron meteorites\u201d is now believed to have occurred in northwestern Greenland\nand the adjacent east coast of Ellesmere Island \u201cat some undetermined time in the past.\u201d It is\nnow apparent that this cosmic iron \u201cwas discovered by the late Dorset people during the few\ncenturies immediately preceding A.D. 1000, and small pieces of meteoric iron are found on\nDorset sites of this period.\u201d? The meteoric iron from northwestern Greenland \u201cspread\n[through trade] at least as far west as Bathurst Island and Little Cornwallis Island and south\nto the northern part of Hudson[\u2018s] Bay.\u201d4 Even so, this is hardly the amount of cosmic mate-\nrial one expects to discover in Arctic regions, especially the area in and around the pole, if\nthe debris had been raining down for millennia. Granted that no one has yet conducted a de-\nliberate search for such material, not enough has yet come to light from this area to satisfy\nTalbott\u2019s interpretation.\nLynn Rose, on the other hand, compared the cosmic pillar to the flux tube which stretches\nbetween Jupiter and its satellite, Io.5 This is a stream of electrons\u2014a 5 million amp, 400,000\nvolt current, which translates into 2 trillion watts of energy\u00b0\u2014that flows in a wide arc from\nboth Jupiter\u2019s poles to Io\u2019s. And, to be sure, I had toyed with this idea myself. But I soon dis-\ncarded it because, while instrumentally detectable, and even photographable through exotic\nlight, Io\u2019s flux tube is not optically visible.\nMeanwhile, Frederic Jueneman saw this axis as a colossal Rankine vortex, a cosmic tor-\nnado of planetary proportions, composed mainly of air and water vapor.\u2019 Although his model\nI: the beginning, as I slowly reconstructed the Saturnian model and its attendant scenario,",

As Jueneman explained it, a Rankine vortex consists of\n\u201cnested cylinders of atmospheric gases and debris, one within another, each separated by\ndensity gradients caused by pressure, thermal, and perhaps electrical differentials.\u201d\u00ae But what\nwould have been the cause of such a planetary vortex?\nAs explained in a previous chapter, proto-Saturn\u2019s proximity would have raised a litho-\nspheric bulge in Earth\u2019s northern region, the shadow of which exists to this day. But, too, as\nthere explained, Earth\u2019s hydrosphere and atmosphere would also have responded to proto-\nSaturn\u2019s attractive force. As Jueneman clarified, this gravitational force would have been en-\nhanced by the inertia inherent in the synchronous rotation of the planetary pair. Thus the\ngentle westerly winds of lower latitudes \u201cwould have turned into increasingly violent south-\nwesterly gales\u201d at higher ones. In their northward spiral, aided by coriolis effects, these hur-\nricane winds would then have towered above Earth\u2019s north polar region.\u00ae\n\u201cThe tremendous energy of forward motion in the air mass, imparted by the relatively\nclose proximity of the northern celestial body, would have been converted into angu-\nlar momentum, increasing the velocity of this atmospheric maelstrom as it continued\nto accelerate into a tighter and tighter spiral. Finally, it would have sent a towering\ntornado-like polar column beyond the upper atmosphere and deep into space, ever\nreaching toward the northern body and forming a gaseous bridge in an attempt to span\nthe void between.\u201d!\u00b0\nThe beauty of this model is that, unlike Talbott\u2019s flow of debris and Rose\u2019s flux tube, it\nreadily explains the whirlwind motion attributed to the mythological axis mundi. But does it\nlend itself to a ray of light shining from above? After all, as we all know, tornadoes are any-\nthing but luminescent. They are, on the contrary, often very dark in appearance, some of\nthem close to black, and definitely opaque enough to mask their internal lightning displays.\nAnd yet, external luminosities have been known to accompany tornadoes such as that which\nroared through St. Louis in 1959. This was described by various witnesses as having been of\n\u201ca continuous illumination,\u201d \u201ca flame-like flare right up from the horizon,\u201d and of \u201cthe shape\nof a broad sword.\u201d!! Others have been described as having a \u201cbeautiful electric blue light\u201d\naround them, or of looking \u201clike a searchlight beam\u201d extending down to the skyline.!?\nJueneman himself attributes various electrical and light activity occurring within his\nplanetary vortex'3 but, as he described it, much like the tornado mentioned above, the overall\nappearance of the planetary vortex would have been a \u201cbluish color\u201d of \u201cexquisite bril-\nliance...encased in a pale green envelope.\u201d '4 Granted that some of these effects stem from\nJueneman\u2019s objective perceptivity, it is difficult to judge how much of them might also be\ndue to his fertile speculation.\nFor years I had accepted Jueneman\u2019s model as being a tentative valid prototype of the\nmythological polar column. Then, as the years went by, my interest shifted to the discovery",

Thus, for instance, in 1991,\nAndrew Gray discovered a bright strand, 150 light years long and a couple wide, near the\ncentre of the Milky Way. Dubbed \u201cthe Snake,\u201d it is similar to other so-called \u201cthreads\u201d which\nhave been discovered within the barrel-shaped region of space known as the Galactic Centre\nLobe. Gray himself is of the opinion that the Snake \u201cis an electrical discharge, like a vast\nlightning bolt\u2014so vast that it just hangs in space, instead of disappearing as earthly lightning\ndoes.\u201d20\nMeanwhile, the \u201ccorkscrew motion\u201d of the jet, as mentioned above, originates from the\nplasma\u2019s discharge system. As Thornhill succinctly explained:\n\u201c...plasma is highly structured, allowing electric currents to flow through it along\nmagnetic field lines in the form of filaments, themselves twisted into ropes. Such\ntwisted filaments are seen in the powerful jets issuing from the cores of active galax-\nies, the tornadic clouds in the Lagoon nebula, the giant prominences streaming from\nthe sun, comet tails, etc.\u201d2!\nMoreover, these twisted filaments are not static, but highly active vortices,?? thus ac-\ncounting for the whirlwind motion endemic in the mythological axis mundi, But then,\nharking back to astral jets, is it known that these rotate? They surely do. Thus, for in-\nstance, data received from the Ulysses spacecraft showed that the twisting field lines\nconnected to both poles of the Sun rotate with it. As Thornhill stated: \u201cAstral jets are a\nmore active and visible manifestation of the same Birkeland currents.\u201d?3 This, of course,\nhad already been ascertained by others, including Eric Lerner, who described such a jet as\n\u201ca plasma-pinching vortex filament.\u201d4 As he explained:\n\u201cThe vortices are produced by a phenomenon known as the pinch effect. A straight\nthread of electric current flowing through a plasma surrounds itself with a cylindrical\nmagnetic field. This field attracts other currents flowing in the same direction. Thus\nthe tiny current threads tend to \u2018pinch\u2019 together, drawing the plasma with them. The\nconverging threads are twined into a plasma rope, much as water converging toward a\ndrain generates a swirling vortex.\u201d 25\nAs indicated by the diagram on the previous page, a Birkeland current has the appearance\nof two serpents twisted about each other. And was not Boreas originally said to have\npossessed serpent tails for feet? (Even so, it should be noted that the serpentine structure of\nthe axis mundi was not always visibly apparent, concerning which much more will be di-\nvulged in a future volume.)?6\nTaking his cue from Thornhill, Talbott, too, latched on to the polar jet theory.

Here it is more than evident that, while willing to accept cosmic\nplasma jets as scaled-up versions of proto-Saturn\u2019s boreal column, Talbott was not ready to\nrelinquish his original idea, and thus sought to amalgamate the two. Thornhill himself was\nnot exactly hostile to this unification. Thus, when questioned about Talbott\u2019s interpretation of\nthe polar column as a stream of fiery debris ejected toward Earth, he replied with these\nwords:\n\u201cT think that for most of the time [the polar column] would have been like a spec-\ntacular auroral effect with very little matter transfer taking place. It is only when it\ntransformed suddenly from a glow discharge to an arc that substantial matter would\nhave been transferred between bodies.\u201d??\nBut can a Birkeland current transfer matter between bodies? Apparently so. As Thornhill\nexplained:\n\u201cTo begin with, a rotating Birkeland current will form a tornado in an atmos-\nphere...Secondly, Eric Crew back in the 80s discussed how lightning usually acceler-\nates positive ions vertically, creating a jet of hot moist air at the top of the discharge\nchannel. In general terms the discharge compresses, heats and accelerates gases from a\nregion of high pressure to a region of lower pressure. So bulk matter is moved by an\nelectric discharge..\u201d3\u00b0\nThe tornadic quality of this sustained Birkeland current thus compensates for the loss of\nJueneman\u2019s Rankine vortex model.\nOr does it have to? After all, with the tidal heaping of the terrestrial atmosphere due to\nproto-Saturn\u2019s proximity combined with its inevitable spiraling motion, the effects proposed\nby Jueneman should have taken place. Even the twisting of the axis can be accounted for\nthrough the workings of a Rankine vortex. Just as terrestrial tornadoes \u201coccasionally exhibit\nsmaller counter-rotating vortices in close proximity to the primary whirlwind,\u201d so \u201con a\nmuch vaster scale, similar counter-rotating catenulate bolus flows would have snaked around\nthe polar column in filamentary fashion.\u201d3! Could it not, therefore, have been that both\ncauses, a planetary Rankine vortex and a sustained Birkeland current, have joined forces in\nproducing the most colossal tornado Earth has ever experienced? Or would the electrical\nforce inherent in a Birkeland current have overpowered the Rankine effect?",

After all, since it, too,\nfollows Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field lines, Io\u2019s flux tube is also a Birkeland current.>? It thus turns\nout, after all, that Lynn Rose\u2019s postulate is not as unsound as | had originally assumed. As\nstressed earlier, however, Io\u2019s flux tube is not optically visible. Neither are the Sun\u2019s pole-\nward emissions. As we have indicated, the mythological axis mundi, on the other hand,\nseems to have been very much visible. So are astral jets. Under what conditions, then, can a\nBirkeland current be made visible as a twisted ray of light? Needless to say, this might not be\nthe right question to ask, especially since Birkeland currents have already been explained as\ninvisible power transmission lines. Even so, as the plasma physicist Anthony Peratt stated at\nthe Laughlin World Conference sponsored by KRONIA Communications on July 8, 2001, a\nBirkeland current can be made visible through the detritus it may collect about it. What is,\nhowever, really visible is the plasma through which these currents flow. To be sure, the\nplasma itself needs to be made visible.\n\nAccording to the electrical engineer, Don Scott, there are three different modes in which\na plasma can operate, and these depend on the strength of the electrical current passing\nthrough it. In what is known as the dark current mode, where the electrical current is very\nlow, the plasma will not glow and, therefore, remains invisible. It can only be detected\nthrough the measurement of its electrical activity with sensitive instruments. As Scott ex-\nplains, the present magnetospheres of the Solar System planets \u201care examples of plasma op-\nerating in the dark current mode.\u201d But if the strength of the electrical current is \u201csignificant,\u201d\nthe entire plasma begins to glow, its brightness being naturally dependent on the strength of\nthe current. If the electrical current is very high, the plasma goes into arc mode, during which\nit \u201cradiates brilliantly over a wide spectrum,\u201d with the current tending to form the filaments\nwe are now becoming familiar with.*3\n\nBut, with a current of 400,000 volts, why does Io\u2019s flux tube not glow? As Peratt ex-\nplains, given the size of the system, this is not a \u201cterribly impressive\u201d amplitude. Translating\ninto one mega-ampere, it even falls short of the seven mega-amperes conducted by Earth\u2019s\ncircular auroras, made visible in Earth\u2019s northern and southern polar skies (even though this\nvaries considerably).34 So that while it is the strength of the current passing through a plasma\nthat accounts for its ability to glow, this strength has to be considered in relation to the size of\nthe system that spawns it or, better said, in relation to the magnitude of the plasma itself. As\nScott explains further, it is not the actual current in total amperes that is the real issue, but the\ncurrent density, that is the amount of amperes per square meter.35\n\nActually, Peratt defines the situation even further and, at the risk of befuddling the lay\nreader, I hereby include his words for the benefit of the specialists. As he stated, whether a\nplasma glows or not relies on how energetic the relativistic electrons happen to be, plus the\nstrength of the magnetic field, \u201cas this determines the intensity of synchrotron radiation the\nelectrons beam towards Earth.\u201d3\u00b0 Those who are interested enough can consult his major\nwork on the subject.37\n\nAs for our own proto-Saturnian polar column\u2014or \u201cpolar Birkeland current\u201d \u2014Peratt es-\ntimates it to have probably carried something like \u201ca thousand mega-ampere into and out of",

Even if scaled down from stellar amplitudes to\nbrown dwarf magnitudes, such jets would remain colossally active in their electrical mani-\nfestation. It is more than probable that proto-Saturn\u2019s polar ray did originate as such a jet, but\nit is doubtful that it still retained its full potential by the time man came upon the scene.\nAs Ken Moss suggested, it would have been more likely that the polar ray mankind re-\nmembers was, at best, the remnant of an original jet.3? And why not? After all, cosmic jets\nare known to fade. As Peratt disclosed in 1992:\n\u201cComparison of the integrated magnitude of the jet in M87 over the period 1934-1980\nshows that the jet is variable and has been fading, more or less uniformly, by about\n0.8 mag per decade between 1964 and 1980. The data imply that over the period\n1952-1980, the total jet intensity fell by at least 2.5 mag. Comparisons of isophotes\ntaken in 1964 and 1979 show no obvious differences in overall shape, apart from ef-\nfects of variation and noise. This indicates that the fading has affected the whole\nchannel uniformly since 1964...\u201d4\u00b0\nThat jets fade is exemplified by our present Sun. The present poleward fields emanating\nfrom the Sun are so relatively weak that they operate in the dark mode. It is, however, doubt-\nful that they always did so.\nAs we shall soon see, brown dwarfs are believed to degenerate into giant gas planets.\nWhat this additionally means is that any jets spawned by such free floaters, already scaled\ndown, would necessarily continue to decay in their electrical amplitude. We have no way of\nknowing at what exact phase in its evolution the proto-Saturnian brown dwarf star had ar-\nrived at during the time of man, prior to its entry into our Solar System. It, however, seems\nreasonable to assume that it was well along its way in its evolutionary transformation. Even\nthe word \u201cjet\u201d might be misleading here where \u201ca sustained Birkeland current\u201d might much\nbetter fill the nomenclative bill.\nDespite all that, none of the above is to say that proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column was devoid\nof electrical activity, or that this activity failed to manifest itself in catastrophic dimensions.\nIt should, however, be emphasized that, during man\u2019s existence on Earth, the polar column\ndid not always exhibit its full tornadic force and, if we are to believe the mytho-historical re-\ncord, its twisted serpentine character was not always apparent. As seen from latitudinal dis-\ntance, very much as Thornhill intuited, the column would have appeared \u201clike a spectacular\nauroral effect,\u201d a tapering swath of light stretching all the way from proto-Saturn to Earth\u2019s\nnorth axial pole, a thing of beauty, even one of tranquility. Yes\u2014it would have been seen to\nwhirl, perhaps even accompanied by an electric hum. It is even possible that ancient man at-\ntempted to approach it. But as one came ever closer to it, its vibrational envelope, to say\nnothing of an electrical feel similar to that encountered prior to a storm, would have been felt\nas a warning against further approach.\nTHE ARCTIC DEPRESSION\nSuch a planetary tornado, in the form of a rotating sustained Birkeland current, acting\ncontinuously over the same area in Earth\u2019s north polar region, scouring the land underneath,\nshould have left an indelible scar.

This bespeaks a different method from other\noceans by which these sediments were collected. Charles Ginenthal understood this extra\nthick sediment as having been deposited by \u201ca global, oceanic tidal wave, flowing north-\nward.\u201d42 This is a theory that has also been proposed by Jueneman.* As the latter indicated,\nhowever, such a flood, acting through waves of translation, would have been subject to\nEarth\u2019s rotation and would have swept from the equator in a colossal spiraling tide toward\nboth poles, to say nothing of travelling back toward the equator.\u201c That being the case, these\nwaves should just as easily have deposited their load of sediment in other land-encircled seas\nwhich would have been in their path, such as Hudson\u2019s Bay and the Black, Caspian, and\nBaltic Seas. Why, then, do we not find a similar thick load of sediment in these depressions?\n\nIt is not that Earth\u2019s Arctic region has not been inundated by an immense flood\u2014which\nsubject is also reserved for a future volume\u2014but this would have entailed an entirely differ-\nent mechanism.*> Under the scheme presented here, it seems more reasonable to suppose that\nthe thick sediment of the Arctic Ocean was created in situ by the constant scouring of the\ntornadic polar column.\n\nAlso, as we have seen, Earth\u2019s boreal lithospheric bulge would have risen because of\nproto-Saturn\u2019s proximity. The tidal heaping of Earth\u2019s interior magma, however, would have\nactually been greater than at the surface. The thermal energy which would have resulted from\nthe friction between this molten material and the enveloping crust would have enhanced the\nmagma\u2019s mobility. This heated plastic matter would then have broken through the surface,\ncausing a collapse of the crust. This is precisely what has been discovered in the Eurasian\nBasin of the Arctic Ocean, an area which \u201crepresents a regional collapse of the Earth\u2019s sur-\nface due to material being removed from the lower mantle.\u201d\n\nEven more recently, a swirling vortex of molten rock has been discovered 3000 kilome-\nters beneath the North Pole.4\u201d Peter Olson and Jonathan Aurnou, then from the Johns Hop-\nkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, traced a flow of almost a quarter of a degree per year\nin a region some 2400 kilometers across. As Olson stated, the flow \u201chas the structure of a gi-\nant hurricane.\u201d48\n\nThere is, incidentally, no point in claiming that these effects could have been caused by a\ndifferent set of circumstances. What is stressed here is that this is precisely what our theory\ndemands and, in that respect, the demand is met. In conjunction with the other physical evi-\ndence from the same region supplied in earlier chapters of this work (to say nothing of what\nwe intend to add in coming volumes), the accumulating signs continue to build up in our the-\nory\u2019s favor.\n\nOne more problem yet to be solved concerns the manner in which Earth came to be\nlocked within proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column. This, however, is going to take us on a final tan-",

As we have already seen, red and brown dwarfs are believed to\n\u201coccupy the middle ground between planets and stars.\u201d4? But the demarcation between stars,\ndwarf stars, and planets seems forever to be changing. To make matters worse, along the way\na new class of free-floating objects were discovered that were \u201clighter than the lightest brown\ndwarf and heavier than the heaviest planets.\u201d> While less massive than brown dwarfs, some\nastronomers have questioned the use of the word \u201cplanets\u201d to describe them.

Thus, to give one lame example, it has. been. cal-\nculated that the objects lurking in the globular cluster known as M22 \u201cmake up as much as\n10 percent of the cluster\u2019s mass\u2014 too numerous to be wandering \u2018orphaned\u2019 planets.\u201d>! As if\nquantity has any bearing in the classifying of astronomical bodies.\nAlan Boss settled on the term \u201csub-brown dwarfs\u201d as a designation for these free-floaters.\nBut, as Glen Schneider opined: \u201cGive a billion years of cooling and evolution, and these ob-\njects may be indistinguishable from planets.\u201d52 This is primarily because it is believed that\nthese objects are still contracting, \u201ccollapsing because of their own gravity.\u201d As Maria Za-\npatero-Osorio stated: \u201cWith time, they will look like Jupiter and Saturn.\u201d*?

All of which eliminates the objection concerning whether such\na brown dwarf star\u2014or should we say sub-brown dwarf star?\u2014could ever turn into the\nplanet Saturn as proposed in the present work. But what of the stated billion years said to be\nrequired for such a transformation?\nUnanimity among astrophysicists seems to be as rare as that among politicians. Thus,\nquite recently, when Goran Sandell discovered what he believes to be a \u201cmonster of a proto-\nstar\u201d in the Cepheus constellation, near the emission nebula known as NGC 7538, he claimed\nthat it, and others like it, could develop into a high-mass star \u201cin an astronomical blink of an\neye\u2014only about 10,000 years.\u201d\nBack in 1977, astronomers focused on a disk-shaped object in the constellation Cygnus\nwhich was identified as an evolving star. Not only that, it was said that it \u201ccould well be a\nsun in the process of forming its own planets.\u201d Although the object, dubbed MWC\n349, had been known since the 1930s, it was only now that they \u201crealized how unusual it",

If a dwarf\nturns fast enough, the spin could drive the clouds into a stellar weather system much\nlike the bands on Jupiter.\u201d\nOr, one might add, also like the bands on Saturn\u2014although, to be sure, the proto-Sat-\nurnian latitudinal cloud bands only became apparent toward the end of the configuration\u2019s\nexistence.\nTHE ACCRETION DISK MODEL\nTogether with the existence of planets in extra-Solar systems, the discoveries enumerated\nabove have added further havoc to the current theory of planet formation. As Zapatero-\nOsorio has stated: \u201cThe formation of young, free-floating, planetary-mass objects like these\nis difficult to explain by our current models of how planets form.\u201d6 And: \u201cThe most\nintriguing question now is how can we explain the formation and evolution of planetary-mass\nobjects outside the solar system?\u201d And, in a press release: \u201cThese free floaters may pose a\nconsiderable challenge to current theories about how planets form.\u201d7!\nThere was a time when the formation of the Solar System planets was believed to have\nbeen due to material being drawn out of the Sun by a close passing star. This theory was\nhowever discarded in favor of the one now accepted in which the planets are theorized to\nhave formed from the same gas cloud that collapsed through its own gravity to form the Sun\nitself. The material remaining after the Sun had formed is said to have continued to circle the\nSun in its equatorial plane. Known as an accretion disk, this gaseous cloud continued to col-\nlapse into smaller clumps of matter, which clumps eventually aggregated into the planets and\nat least some of their accompanying satellites. There have been various other theories, but the\naccretion disk model became the one most widely accepted.\nWhen it comes to extra-solar systems, however, it has recently been discovered that the\naccretion process encounters difficulties. Thus, for instance, 90% of the young stars known to\nexist in the Orion nebula are surrounded by so-called accretion disks \u201cthat could potentially\nclump into new worlds.\u201d But, as Kathy Svitil noted, \u201cmaking a planet, it turns out, isn\u2019t all\nthat easy to do.\u201d72\n\u201cTRobert] O\u2019Dell christened these disks \u2018proplyds,\u2019 for protoplanetary disks. The\nname may actually be a misnomer, because these disks will evaporate within a mil-\nlion years, probably before planets can form.\u201d\n\u201cIntense radiation streaming from the nebula\u2019s brightest infant stars can stop the\nprocess in its tracks, says astronomer C. Robert O\u2019Dell of Vanderbilt University in\nNashville, Tennessee. \u2018Radiation evaporates away the disks in a few hundred thou-\nsand years or less,\u2019 he says, leaving little or no time for planets to coalesce.\u201d",

What makes this system doubly interesting is that, un-\nlike others previously discovered, it resembles mostly our own Solar System. One of these\nplanets has been calculated to have a mass equivalent to 2.6 that of Jupiter, with the other\ncontaining a mere 0.76 of Jupiter\u2019s mass. The two planets therefore \u201chave about the same\nmass ratio as Jupiter and Saturn.\u201d Moreover, unlike other previously discovered extra-solar\nsystems, the planets around 47 Ursae Majoris travel in circular, rather than elliptical, orbits.\nAs Debra Fischer noted: \u201cNow, for the first time, we have a system that looks like it had a\ngentle dynamical history, similar to our own solar system.\u201d What is germane to our present\ntopic, however, came to light when Greg Laughlin conducted a computer simulation of the\nsystem only to discover that \u201cthe gravity of the larger inner planet would jostle planetesimals\nin the star\u2019s habitable zone, preventing them from aggregating into a terrestrial planet.\u201d7\u201d\nGranted that the above may be considered unique examples, what about our own Solar\nSystem? Despite everything that had been claimed previously, back in 1960, W. H. McCrea\u2019s\ncalculations indicated that planets could not have originated by aggregation between the orbit\nof Jupiter and the Sun.\u201d8 That same year, R. A. Lyttleton confirmed this assumption through\nhis own calculations, again showing that the terrestrial planets, that is those within the orbit\nof Jupiter, could not have formed from the so-called accretion disk, but must have originated,\nby disruption, from the giant gaseous planets themselves.\u201d? Not everyone agreed, however,\nand, in 1979, Robert Jastrow was still claiming general ignorance when it came to the forma-\ntion of our Solar System\u2019s inner planets. As he wrote:\n\u201cWe can understand the birth of the giant planets of the solar system\u2014Jupiter, Saturn,\nUranus, and Neptune...But the smaller planets\u2014the earth, Mars, Venus and Mer-\ncury\u2014their origin is a mystery. Somehow they collected out of tiny grains of matter\nand developed into full-sized planets. We may never know exactly how the earth and\nits sister planets were born.\u201d8\u00b0\nBy 1997, there were other astrophysicists who began questioning the theory of planet\nformation through the core accretion mechanism,\u00ae! so that it eventually had to be admitted\nthat the accretion disk model falls flat on its face. By then, Uranus and Neptune were made to\njoin the terrestrial planets as being impossible to have been formed through the accretion\nprocess. As Joshua Roth stated: \u201cPity Uranus and Neptune...no one can even explain why\nthey exist.\u201d82 Agreeing with what has now become the general consensus, Roth declares that",

News of such a brown dwarf did not take long in coming.\n\nActually, there already had existed indirect evidence for several brown dwarfs orbiting\naround stars. But direct evidence did eventually filter through. This concerned a brown dwarf\nthat Michael Liu and his colleagues discovered through the infrared adaptive-optics systems\nof the Gemini North and Keck telescopes. What these optic systems disclosed was a brown\ndwarf \u201cglowing faintly\u201d around the \u201cSun-like star\u201d known as 15 Sagittae.8\u2019 If nothing else,\nthis takes care of the objection that the sub-brown dwarf that was proto-Saturn had no busi-\nness residing, or settling, within the Solar System. Moreover, in comparison to our Solar\nSystem, the proximity of the brown dwarf in question to 15 Sagittae, \u201cas little as 14 astro-\nnomical units,\u201d would have positioned it \u201cbetween Saturn and Uranus,\u201d\u00ae not far from the\nvery locality in which proto-Saturn itself finally settled.\n\nWhat is also interesting is that, according to Liu, this brown dwarf \u201cis too massive to\nhave formed within a circumstellar disk like a planet.\u201d8\u00b0 While expressing his belief that\n\u201cthere are a diversity of physical processes that act to populate the outer regions of exoplanet\nsystems,\u201d\u00ae Liu did not venture to say by what possible procedure such a dwarf could have\nbeen formed. Bo Reipurth, on the other hand, has proposed that \u201cbrown dwarfs begin their\nlives as protostellar \u2018embryos\u2019 just like ordinary stars\u2014but are gravitationally ejected from\ntheir parent gas clouds before they have time to grow.\u201d\n\nBut what of the planets in our own Solar System? Planetary ejection had been proposed\nby orthodox astronomers long before the discovery of extra-solar planets. But this was an\nentirely different mode of ejection in which small planets were theorized to have been ejected\nby larger ones. In 1989, V. N. Zharkov and A. V. Kozenko revived this theory by again pro-\nposing that Jupiter must have ejected an \u201cembryo\u201d which then initiated the formation of Sat-\nurn, with further ejected \u201cembryos\u201d forming the planets Uranus and Neptune.\u201d In 1993,\nwhile questioning the very process of what he termed \u201cthe often-invoked idea that planets all\ncondensed from a collapsed cloud of material in orbit around the Sun,\u201d Thomas Van\nFlandern proposed that cosmic bodies are emitted by a fast rotating parent.

Here we follow what is being\ndiscovered in our immediate spatial neighborhood, which continues to lend credibility to all\nthose who have been stressing the plasma and electric nature of the Universe. In this respect,\nHalton Arp had the following to offer:\n\n\u201cThe assumption in cosmogony until now has been that all bodies in the universe\ncondensed out of a uniformly spread, homogeneous medium and hierarchically ag-\ngregated to their current sizes. The evidence, however, is that proto-bodies are ejected\nfrom previously existing parent bodies and subsequently grow to their presently ob-\nserved sizes. We have seen this strongly in the formation of galaxies, quasars and\ncluster galaxies and quasars...We are seeing it now in the formation of planets.\u201d95\n\nBut bear with me a wee longer while we back-track a little and I promise that, by the end\nof this last chapter, we will have managed to drive our ultimate peg into its hole.\n\nASTRAL EJECTIONS\n\nLet us move far out in space into the dominion of galaxies. How are galaxies formed?\nThe theory that new galaxies are formed by ejection from older galaxies harks back to 1957\nas adduced by Viktor Ambarzumian,\u00ae who has long been regarded as a hero of science in his\nnative Armenia. This theory has also been one of the mainstays of Halton Arp\u2019s career.\nMeanwhile, Hannes Alfv\u00e9n had for long suggested that plasma filaments, which have since\nbeen detected in space in quantum sufficit, are responsible for the formation of galaxies. An-\nthony Peratt, a former student of Alfv\u00e9n who later acted as his secretariat, and who has since\nbecome a renowned plasma physicist presently working at Los Alamos National Laboratory,\ndecided to test Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s hypothesis. What Peratt discovered in the laboratory is that \u201cplasma\nfilaments tend to twist up into what look like tiny spiral galaxies.\u201d Through computer simu-\nlation, he then scaled the action up to galactic size. Starting with two parallel filaments that\nare drawn together by their magnetic fields, and followed by what Eric Lerner called \u201ca pro-\nlonged mating dance,\u201d the filaments merged into a single structure that correctly mimicked a\nbona fide spiral galaxy. Some of these simulations even produced the poleward jets seen\nemanating from real-life galaxies.\u201d\n\nAs Lerner noted, computer simulations are one thing, the real Universe is quite another. It\nwas, however, not long after Peratt had published his results that, in 1984, real filaments,\nmore than a hundred light-years long, were observed at the centre of our own galaxy, the\nMilky Way.

Arp talks of \u201cnewly created matter\u201d as a matter of fact as so, also, do most astro-\nphysicists. He, however, clarifies this by stating that \u201cit would not strictly be new creation\nbut merely materialization of mass-energy from a different, perhaps diffuse location.\u201d 1\u00b0\n\u201cOf course if the universe is operationally defined as everything that is detectable or\npotentially detectable there can be no such thing as \u2018new\u2019 matter. So when we speak\nof creation of matter we do not mean matter coming into our universe from some-\nwhere else (there is nowhere else) or from nothing. We must mean the transformation\nof previously existing mass-energy. Probably this means materialization from a pre-\nviously diffused state...\u201d 101\nGranted, Arp does not speak of plasma, but his \u201cpreviously diffused state\u201d can be under-\nstood as just that. In fact, if we are to believe Alfv\u00e9n, plasma simply exists and, as we have\nseen, the entire Universe is actually composed of 99% of it. As Lerner paraphrased Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s\nargument:\n\u201cTn any plasma...tiny vortex filaments form spontaneously, and over time they grow\nlarger and larger. Given enough time...there\u2019s no reason why cosmic filaments\ncouldn\u2019t have grown to a length of billions of light-years. Gathering matter around\nthem, the filaments could have organized the universe into a complex web of mag-\nnetic fields, electric currents, and plasma\u2014a kind of cosmic power grid.\u201d 1\nOnce these filaments organize themselves into super-cluster complexes, they will have\nacquired so much mass that they will continue to be shaped by gravity as well as electric and\nmagnetic fields. Gravity itself would break the filaments into \u201ccluster-size clouds of plasma,\nlike beads on a string.\u201d Eventually, while being further compressed by new filaments, the\nplasma will again be broken up and, still according to Alfv\u00e9n, would then form galaxies.\nMore than that, the sequence would continue to be repeated in steps, down to stars, planets,\nand their satellites.!3 It is for this reason that plasma is now considered to be the Funda-\nmental State of Matter. ! Or, as the renowned physicist David Bohm has been known to\nclaim: \u201cPlasmas are the origin of everything.\u201d!05\nThroughout the years, Arp has supplied a large body of observational evidence verifying\nthe concept.!

As\nhe explained, \u201cbrown dwarfs in the plasma environment of a brighter star become gas giants,\nspitting out rocky planets and moons from their interiors in an attempt to alleviate electrical\nstresses.\u201d When it comes to the direction in which these bodies are ejected, Thornhill then\noffered the following: \u201cWhether the spitting occurs in the polar or equatorial direction de-",

In the case of HH objects, they are generally more active than our\nSun, that is, more electrically stressed.\u201d !73\nArp himself does not treat of dwarf stars, brown or red. As we have seen, however, ob-\nservations have led him to believe that poleward ejection is a process that operates on all\nscales. So why not brown dwarf stars?\nTrue, no jets from brown dwarfs have so far been detected. Because of their low mass\nand feeble optical radiation, however, brown dwarf stars themselves are very difficult objects\nto detect. The detection of any existing jets emanating from them would be all that more dif-\nficult. Even so, there are other emissions from brown dwarfs to be considered. Thus, even as\nthe writing of this book is nearing the end, astronomical discoveries continue to accumulate\nin favor of its thesis. To begin with, on December 15, 1999, Bob Rutledge and his colleagues\nnoted an X-ray flare emanating from the brown dwarf star designated LP 944-20, located in\nthe constellation Fornax, estimated at 16 light-years from Earth. \u201cIt seemed fantastically\nbright and hard to believe,\u201d said Gibor Basri who then hailed from the University of Califor-\nnia at Berkeley. The flare appeared \u201cbriefly as an intense flash before fading out over the\nfollowing two hours.\u201d !74\nLess than a year later, a group of graduate students on a National Science Foundation\nsummer program, working at the Very Large Array near Socorro, New Mexico, detected\nstrong radio waves emanating from the same brown dwarf star. These emissions \u201cspiked up\nto 10,000 times stronger than what astronomers thought possible, indicating an intense flare\nof energy that may be similar to flares on the Sun,\u201d researchers said. The dwarf was found to\nemit these radio waves constantly \u201cwith intermittent flares that last for hours.\u201d As Shri Kul-\nkarni stated: \u201cMany astronomers are surprised at this discovery, because they didn\u2019t expect\nsuch strong radio emissions from this object.\u201d!25 Or, as Eduardo Martin, from the University\nof Hawaii, phrased it:\n\u201cIt is not surprising that LP 944-20 has flares, but it is surprising that they are so\nbright in the radio [wavelengths]. The result is significant in telling us that brown\ndwarfs break the rules of stellar astronomy.\u201d !26\nCall me naive when it comes to plasma physics, but do not these two items tend to throw\na certain amount of doubt re Thornhill\u2019s claim that brown dwarf stars are too electrically low\nstressed to enable them to emit jets. Besides, as Arp discovered in a certain galaxy that he has\nstudied, the radio jet, the X-ray jet, and the optical jet \u201care all coincident and define a precise\nejection axis.\u201d !27 Radio and X-ray emissions thus seem to go hand in hand with optical jets.\nSo if brown dwarfs emit both radio and X-ray emissions, the likelihood of their emitting op-\ntical jets does not seem that far fetched.\nAdditionally, and more importantly, there are the so-called accretion, or circumstellar,\ndisks to consider. As we have seen, the birth-place of planets these disks could not be. Most,\nif not all, of the stars emanating plasma jets, however, are also encircled by these disks. Do\nbrown dwarfs exhibit such disks?",

More than that, circumstellar disks are be-\nlieved to be linked to these circumstellar disks. !3! More than that, circumstellar disks are be-\nlieved to be crucial in the formation of jets.!32 As one theory proclaims, it is \u201ca mixture of\nions, atoms, molecules and dust\u201d raining onto circumstellar disks along magnetic field lines\nthat accounts for the generation of jets. These magnetic field lines are then said to be \u201cpulled\nin\u201d from the perpendicular, or pinched. Centrifugal force then \u201cflings material outward along\nthe lines.\u201d Finally, the \u201cinertia of the swirling material twists the field lines into a helix,\nwhich helps to channel the outward-flowing material in a vertical direction\u201d !33\u2014which is so\ndescriptive of a Birkeland current.\nIf the above turns out to be correct, the newly discovered disks surrounding free-floating\ndwarfs should act in like manner, and one can perhaps see the day when astral jets may yet\nbe detected emanating from brown dwarf stars. And yet we have previously seen that Alfv\u00e9n\nbelieved the jets to have been generated by the induction of electric currents in the interstellar\nplasma toward the centre of galaxies \u201cwhere they turn and flow upwards along the spin axis.\u201d\nTo use Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s own terminology, this current then \u201cshort-circuits\u201d and, dumping vast\namounts of energy into the galaxy\u2019s core, ends up \u201cblowing a fuse.\u201d It is the blast from this\n\u201cfuse-blowing\u201d that propels the jets of plasmas up the spin axes of galaxies. Although Alfv\u00e9n\nwas referring to galaxies, rather than individual stars or less massive bodies, is this method of\ngeneration really that much different from the one proposed above?\nThornhill himself seems to accept both methods as being compatible. Thus, concerning\nAlfv\u00e9n\u2019s theory, he has stated that:\n\u201cOur Sun, Jupiter and Saturn, etc., all have equatorial plasmoids. It seems to be the\nnormal state for spherical magnetized anodes in a galactic discharge. Only when the\nenergy stored in those plasmoids becomes excessive will it switch to a polar jet (ac-\ncording to Alfv\u00e9n).\u201d !34\nBut then, in discussing the proposed circumstellar or placental cloud around proto-Saturn,\nhe also had this to say:\n\u201cDwardu [Cardona] mentions proto-Saturn\u2019s accretion disk. Regardless of whether\nthere was such a disk, in my opinion [it] would have nothing to do with accretion and\na whole lot to do with expulsion. Whatever its origin, it would intercept electrical en-\nergy and radiate in the infra-red. In fact it is the infra-red glow from a brown dwarf\nthat is used to infer an \u2018accretion disk\u2019 rather than direct observation.\u201d !3>",

But, relying\non an old clich\u00e9, I hope no one will end up throwing out the baby with the bath water if\nsuch errors are discerned. I also reserve the right to amend what might in future be found\nto be amiss with the conclusions reached in this work. I will in no way be embarrassed if I\nhave to retract whatever is found not to fit the general hypothesis presented herein. That is\nthe way theories are supposed to be formed. That is the only way science can progress. I\nknow this work will run its gamut of criticism. I am prepared for that. After all, if what I have\npresented bears any semblance to what really transpired in the past, the tenets of various sci-\nentific disciplines will have to be reconsidered. Such revisionist work will not sit well with\nthe old guard. But, to use another old clich\u00e9, do not mistake me for a lonely voice in the de-\nsert. I am not alone in most of what I have so far presented. I belong to an ever-growing\nschool of interdisciplinarians who have immersed themselves in the above and related stud-\nies. The old guard will eventually pass away, as it always does. It is to younger minds that\nthe future is bequeathed. In the meantime, I put a gun to no one\u2019s head, so believe what you\nwill.\nThe main problem with the reconstruction of these hoary events lies with plasma cosmol-\nogy which, ironically, serves as the best evidence in favor of their occurrence. As in other\nmatters touched upon in this work, once again, this is not to be wondered at. Despite Hannes\nAlfv\u00e9n\u2019s pioneering work in the 1930s, and Anthony Peratt\u2019s more recent seminal disclo-\nsures!, plasma cosmology is still in its infancy. As the latter confessed in 1992:\n\u201cBecause of their strong interaction with electromagnetism, plasmas display a com-\nplexity in structure and motion that far exceeds that found in matter in the gaseous,\nliquid, or solid states. For this reason, plasmas, especially their electrodynamic prop-\nerties, are far from understood.\u201d2\nGranted that plasma science has progressed immensely since then, its exact behavior in\nrelation to astronomy remains temporarily controversial. Worse still, proponents of the proto-\nSaturnian model are not all of one mind when it comes to the mechanics involved in keeping\nthe configuration stacked up in linear formation. And this entails the exact nature of proto-\nSaturn\u2019s polar column. The main contestant of the specific nature of this column as adduced\nin the foregoing pages stems from the fertile mind of Wallace Thornhill whose knowledge of\nplasma physics ranks him among the best in the field. It behooves us, therefore, to take his\nobjections seriously enough to comment at some length about them.\nThus, for instance, not only does Thornhill not believe in brown dwarf jets, he even\ndoubts the ejection of brown dwarfs from stars. True, as we have seen, he had previously\nstated that in his humble opinion, HH 34 is spitting out objects \u201cwhich might become\u201d indi-\nvidual brown dwarfs.3 A day later, however, he revised his opinion by claiming that such a",

Nor would it have been possible for it to\nhave provided Earth with light, feeble or otherwise, let alone enough heat to generate and\nharbor life.5\nWhat, then, can be said against this? Speaking of the plasma experiments he conducted,\nAlfv\u00e9n asked: \u201cIf we can extrapolate from the laboratory to the solar system, which is a hun-\ndred trillion times larger in extent, then why shouldn\u2019t plasma still behave the same way for\nthe entire observable universe\u2014another hundred trillion times larger?\u201d\u00ae I point this out here\nbecause, if it is allowable to scale up from laboratory experiments to the Solar System, and\nfrom the Solar System to the Universe, it must then be allowable, as it really is, to scale down\nfrom stellar masses to brown dwarf stars and even lower to sub-brown dwarfs. As Don Scott\npointed out:\n\u201cThe differences in scale (as Tony [Peratt] has tried to point out MANY times) are\ncompletely unimportant. They all work the same way.\u201d7\nScaling down, however, involves more than just size and mass. It also involves ampli-\ntude, and thus luminosity, as well as distance and even speed, to say nothing of time. All\nelements must be scaled down, and not necessarily all by the same percentage. Thus, when\nthe knots in an astral jet are scaled down to sub-brown dwarf proportions, they will no longer\nbe as bright as stars, but, at best, only as bright as the sub-brown dwarf that spawns them.\nAnd even then, this only holds true for the knot\u2019s initial inception. If the sub-brown dwarf\nthat was proto-Saturn eventually turned into the gaseous planet we now know by that name,\nwhat is there against assuming that its knots would eventually turn into rocky terrestrial plan-\nets? The light-years distance which separates jet condensations from their stellar parents\nwould also then be scaled down to more modest stretches. Besides, does not Thornhill accept\nthat proto-Saturn had been a brown dwarf star? Does he not himself interpret proto-Saturn\u2019s\npolar column as a sustained plasma discharge in the form of Birkeland current? And has he\nBirkeland current?\nnot also told us that astral jets are a more active and visible manifestation of the same\nAt the risk of befuddling the reader, this is the manner in which Thornhill extricated him-\nself from the above dilemma:\n\u201cInstead of being a small but normal stellar anode in the galactic discharge, and ac-\ncepting electrons, proto-Saturn would find itself a cathode, ejecting electrons, once it\nentered the Sun\u2019s more positively charged domain.

Despite this enormous difference in amplitude\u2014or, at\nleast, a difference in opinion\u2014this would mean that, by the time man came upon the scene,\nEarth would have moved light years away with no possibility of leaving proto-Saturn within\nsight.\nWhat the time-lapse photographs in question actually indicate, however, is the displace-\nment, and therefore motion, of \u201cpockets of gas\u201d within the jet, and not the motion of the jet\nitself. The knots, or condensations, in cometary tails also travel down the tail, and quick suc-\ncession of photographs indicate that they move at speeds up to 250 kilometers per second\n(540,000 miles an hour). Their motion, however, is erratic, with the acceleration \u201cturning on\nand off capriciously,\u201d as it varies with time. In fact, some knots have \u201cvery little speed or ac-\nceleration\u201d and, as Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan reported, their motion \u201cis as unpredictable as\nthe weather.\u201d?3 Moreover, while cometary tails lengthen as they near the Sun, they do not\ntravel away from the nucleus at velocities close to the speed of light. As scaled-down ver-\nsions of astral jets, their size and velocity of emission are reduced in keeping with their mod-\nest amplitudes.\nWorse still is that not all knots are seen to travel down astral jets. Comparisons of images\nfrom 1934 to 1980 of the jet spawned by M87 show that the knots, or hot spots, imbedded in\nit did not move. It cannot therefore be a law of plasma physics that knots in jets must\ntravel.\nOf more importance to our study, when it comes to galaxies, Jayant Narlikar and P. K.\nDas showed in 1980 that \u201cas the particles in the ejected matter gain mass, they slow down in\norder to conserve momentum.\u201d In other words, they decelerate, and even come to a halt5 As\nArp added: \u201cThe Narlikar-Das calculations apply to the most favorable case for escape from\nthe ejecting galaxy\u201d and this material exits \u201calong the minor axis,\u201d which is the axis of rota-\ntion.26 We are here, therefore, speaking of galactic jets. And if galactic jets can decelerate,\nand even come to a halt, so, therefore, can stellar and sub-stellar jets.",

There does not seem to be\na consensus concerning the answer to this most important question. Beginning with the sug-\ngestion of W. Baade and R. Minkowski in 1954, astrophysicists have assumed that astral jets\nconstitute the actual ejections of matter.27 But, as Don Scott more recently noted:\n\u201cWe should not infer too much when we see the word \u2018jet\u2019 used (especially by as-\ntronomers). A columnar plasma can /ook like a jet. But these jets are not jet engine\nexhausts\u2014they are not massive flows of material. There may not be much stuff\nflowing in the jet\u2014except for an electric current. The \u2018stuff\u2019 may be getting squeezed\nwhile remaining relatively stationary within the \u2018jet\u2019.\u201d\u00b08\nOr, to quote Peratt, who himself uses the word \u201cjet\u201d in relation to these astral emanations\nthroughout his 1992 opus:\n\u201cGood as \u2018jets\u2019 are, [they] are not really jets. They are perceived as \u2018jets\u2019 of gas by\nastronomers and jets of gas do exist. But gas jets do not have the radiation properties,\nnot even the features, of what we observe in space.\n\u201cJets also do not exist in plasma (charged particle beams) except when a very strong\nmagnetic field is there to keep it from immediately flaring out...The term \u2018jet\u2019 is very\npopular and convenient if physically incorrect.\u201d?9\nWhich brings us back to Andrew Gray\u2019s \u201celectric discharge\u201d hanging out in space with-\nout dissipating, to say nothing of Thornhill\u2019s own sustained plasma discharge.\nAnother objection that Thornhill raised is that \u201cbeing enveloped in a plasma vortex would\nnot be conducive to pleasant living conditions\u201d3\u00b0 since this would have placed the entire\nEarth within the vortex of a world-wide tornado.3! And, to be sure, while astral jets are rela-\ntively slim or narrow in close proximity to the stars that spawn them, they tend to fan out\nfarther away, \u201creaching a diameter wider than the orbit of Pluto.\u201d22 But this, again, is merely\na matter of scale. Thus when we look at HH 34 we see quite distinctly that the width of the\njet is not as wide as the diameters of the knots embedded within it. This is even more evident\nin HH 409, the jet emitted by HD 163296. These two systems show quite clearly that the\nwidths of astral jets fall short of the diameters of the knots. In fact it is quite obvious that,\nwere these knots to be thought of as planets, the jets would only encompass their polar areas,\nvery much as posited for proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column in relation to Earth.\nThornhill is also of the opinion that had Earth really been suspended within an astral jet\nemanating from proto-Saturn, all of terrestrial life would have been electrocuted.*? In view of\nthe number of deaths of people reported to have been struck by that plasma discharge known\nto us as lightning, Thornhill\u2019s concern is understandable. This author was himself, at the age\nof twelve, blown off his feet by a lightning discharge. Fortunately it was not a direct hit. Di-\nrect hits by lightning discharges on persons who managed to escape with their life are not, on",

But, as\nDon Scott felt moved to clarify, this would only have ensued at ground zero and could never\nhave applied to Earth\u2019s entire population.*4\nThornhill disagreed, stating that, as the voltage rises, \u201cthe plasma would extend to lower\nlatitudes until the entire surface of the planet was covered.\u201d> He did not, however, provide\nan electrical justification concerning why the jet\u2019s voltage should rise. And then, again, we\nrun headlong into Thornhill\u2019s belief that proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column was a sustained plasma\ndischarge in the form of Birkeland current. Why, then, would this sustained plasma discharge\nnot be subject to a similar, if not identical, rise in voltage?\nOne of Thornhill\u2019s greatest objections has to do with the force that would have kept Earth\naligned with proto-Saturn\u2019s rotational axis, which brings us full circle to the problem we\nstarted with. As he had it stated: \u201cNo one has shown how massive planets can be simply sus-\npended above the pole of a star while enveloped in a plasma discharge.\u201d3\u00b0 And:\n\u201cMost of the planets so far discovered [in extra-solar systems] are gas giants that oc-\ncupy normal [that is equatorial] orbits close to their stellar parents. They are not sus-\npended in polar stellar jets.\u201d37\n\u201cIf [what Cardona claims was] the normal mode of planet formation we should not\nexpect to find planets around nearby stars by looking for the stellar wobble caused by\nnormal orbits.\u201d 38\nBut, for one thing, no one is advocating that planets can only be formed through poleward\nejection. If Arp is correct in that some galaxies are ejected from other galaxies in a lateral di-\nrection, the same may probably be true for the ejection of some stars and planets. And then,\nalso, no one is proclaiming that planets ejected in poleward direction must remain forever\nstacked. Obviously, the Saturnian system itself eventually relaxed into equatorial orbits once\nit entered the domain of the Sun. Meanwhile, because of their very lack of equatorial orbital\nmotion, any extra-solar planets suspended in polar jets would not cause stellar wobble, and\nwould thus be among the most difficult celestial objects capable of being detected.\nThornhill claims that \u201cthere would need to be a persistent force to keep the planets sus-\npended above a stellar pole.\u201d3? In discussing the E galaxies aligned along the jet of M87,\nArp, too, found reason to ask an identical question: \u201cWhy had not these older galaxies drifted\noff this alignment into the general field in all this time?\u201d But as he himself recognized, \u201cbe-\ning ejected along the minor axis [that is the axis of rotation] they have no angular momentum\nand simply remain along their original ejection direction.\u201d# This applies just as well to our\nhypothesized situation because, out in space, there would have been no nearby bodies that\nwould have tended to exert their attractive influence on proto-Saturn and its entou-\nrage\u2014which is one additional reason demanding that the proto-Saturnian system would\noriginally have been a free-floating sub-brown dwarf system outside our Solar System.",

        "content": "To be sure, Thornhill is not opposed to the contention that planets are ejected from brown\n\ndwarf stars. As he has stated: \u201cBrown dwarfs are constitutionally and energetically best\nsuited to produce rocky planets and moons.\u201d4! Neither is he adverse to the claim that proto-\nSaturn itself ejected planets which are now members of our Solar System, together with our\nown Earth,\u201d precisely as postulated in the present thesis. Exactly in what, then, does he dif-\nfer from us? One of the main reasons behind Thornhill\u2019s list of objections enumerated above\nbecomes apparent when he compares proto-Saturn\u2019s characteristics to Jupiter\u2019s magneto-\nsphere. As he explained:\n\u201cThe polar column can then be imagined as having been equivalent to a hyperactive\nmagnetospheric display of a size exceeding that of Jupiter\u2019s in which the Birkeland\ncurrents were visible. Remember that Jupiter\u2019s \u2018tail\u2019 stretches invisibly for half a bil-\nlion km to the orbit of Saturn.\u201d48\nlion km to the orbit of Saturn.\u201d43\nJupiter\u2019s \u201cmagnetospheric display,\u201d which stretches into its billion km \u201ctail,\u201d is however\nequatorially wrapped around the giant planet. It is not a polar, or bipolar, emission. And this\nis precisely Thornhill\u2019s point because, as far as he is concerned, the planets were ejected\nfrom proto-Saturn in a lateral, or equatorial, direction. As we have seen, according to Thorn-\nhill, only on entry into the Solar System would the planets have aligned themselves in a lin-\near configuration as proto-Saturn dragged its entourage behind it much in the manner of\nComet Shoemaker-Levy 9. Thus, still according to him, \u201cwe are talking simply about a linear\narrangement of bodies where the only force between them is attractive.\u201d This would then\nconform with Talbott\u2019s contention that Earth had originally orbited proto-Saturn in a phase-\nlocked equatorial orbit, concerning which no evidence was ever produced from the mytho-\nhistorical record, and against which enough objections have already been raised in the past\npages of this work.\nWithin the confines of Thornhill\u2019s scenario, it then becomes evident that proto-Saturn\u2019s\npolar column would also have come into being after proto-Saturn and its entourage invaded\nthe Solar System. And it is this scenario that precludes him from accepting the pre-existence\nof proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column.\u2018 But, as Peratt stated on the strength of his plasma studies,\n\u201cthe column is the configuration out of which planets form so it should always have been\nthere.\u201d Thus, when I brought it to Peratt\u2019s attention that, according to the mytho-historical\nrecord, proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column was one of two items\u2014the other being the celestial wa-\nters\u2014which was never seen as having been created, he reaffirmed both our positions by as-\nserting that there is much quantitative evidence that tends to support this.47\nGranted that we have been discussing emissions of vastly different amplitudes, might we\nnot, after all, be embroiling ourselves in nomenclature? One thing we have surely learned is\nthat the demarcation between stars, red dwarf stars, brown dwarf stars, sub-brown dwarf\nstars, and giant gaseous planets is simply one of magnitude. We have also been discussing\nknots, condensations, plasmoids, and planetisimals \u201cimbedded\u201d in astral \u201cjets\u201d when, in fact,\nthese are terms that connote the same phenomena even if, perhaps, at different stages of",

My reluctance in accepting his convictions notwithstanding, he might yet turn\nout to be correct in some of his opposing contentions. While I feel confident in my own\nviews, I will not be adamant about their acceptance. My honest opinion is that both his\nclaims and mine, to say nothing of David Talbott\u2019s, should remain open to further investiga-\ntion until our presently opposing beliefs can be reconciled through further developments, and\na better understanding, of plasma cosmology.\nAdditionally, and to be fair, while the use of Halton Arp\u2019s data, as utilized in this work,\nseems to imply his endorsement of the Saturn thesis, I must confess that nothing can be fur-\nther from the truth. On the contrary, as he has made clear to me:\n\u201c,..the biggest difficulty I see with matching the Saturnist interpretation of the his-\n\u201c...the biggest difficulty | see with matching the Saturnist interpretation of the his-\ntorical records is the very long time scales needed for dynamical and material evolu-\ntion. Also I wonder how much the record reflects the world picture of the [ancient]\npriests who can be very illusionary and how much it represented the practical obser-\nvations of the citizens tilling the fields. Your point about independent myths agreeing\nacross time and culture is the point that impresses me the most. But then I think of the\nunfortunate situation today when experts disagree totally when looking at the same\nreplicable [astronomical] photograph.\u201d48\nThere is, however, nothing in the present volume that contradicts the posited time scales\nrequired by the evolution of celestial bodies. No date for the origin of Earth\u2014or proto-Sat-\nurn, for that matter\u2014has been proposed, and no date, or age, shall be. Neither will I offer\nanything concerning what Arp calls \u201cthe unfortunate situation today\u201d concerning expert dis-\nagreement on any subject.\nAs for the consistency of the mytho-historical record itself, enough has been presented in\nthese past pages (with much more yet to come in hopeful future volumes). Arp, of course, is\nnot yet well acquainted with this record, having only come in contact with the Saturn thesis\nduring one single conference sponsored by KRONIA Communications, which was held in\nPortland, Oregon, in September of 2000. This is not to say that he will necessarily accept the\nthesis, either in part or in its entirety, once he acquaints himself with the evidence in its favor.\nMy only hope is that if he ever gets to read this work, he will at least consider it.",

While\nnot entirely convinced during the conference, he soon showed interest right after the event\nthrough personal communications with David Talbott and Wallace Thornhill. Thus, during\nthe proceedings of the KRONIA conference, held in Laughlin, Nevada, in July of the fol-\nlowing year, he had no qualms in stating that, because of scaled-up Birkeland currents, he\nwas not surprised to hear of the Saturnian configuration or its attendant polar column.*? As\nThornhill later reported:\n\u201cAccording to Peratt, the recognized authority on the subject, the plasma behaviour\nfits the detailed representations of the polar column perfectly. I am aware of the com-\nplexities of plasma discharge instabilities and am satisfied with Peratt\u2019s subsequent\nidentification of the polar column with that phenomenon. The \u2018Peratt instabilities,\u2019 as\nthey are now known, turn out to be far more complex than any of us could have\nimagined and therefore form an unbeatable test of the polar configuration model.\u201d \u00b0\nWhat led Peratt to seriously consider the Saturnian, or polar, configuration theory was his\nown first-hand experience with plasma experiments at the Los Alamos National Laboratories,\nNew Mexico. To begin with, having served as Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s secretariat, he was quite familiar\nwith the latter\u2019s theories. Thus, during a lecture given at one of Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s \u201cNew Astronomy\u201d\nseminars at the University of California, San Diego\u2014circa 1980-1981 \u2014 Alfv\u00e9n had proposed\nthat cosmic objects form in columns,\u00b0>! very much in the manner being here propounded. As\nPeratt later clarified, plasmoids are produced in an electrical discharge.>? And:\n\u201cPlasma cosmogony, via Alfv\u00e9n, provides the physics for the evolution of the plas-\nmoids into planetisimals and eventually planets. These form like beads on a string.\u201d 3\nIt might be argued that one planet suspended beneath another, or beneath a sub-brown\ndwarf, can hardly be compared to \u201cbeads on a string.\u201d However, as those who are already\nfamiliar with the Saturnian configuration theory know, and as will be disclosed in future se-\nquels to this work, there were other planets besides Earth that were involved in the configu-\nration in question. Even so, when questioned on the possibility of brown dwarf stars ejecting\njets, Peratt\u2019s answer echoed Thornhill\u2019s with a resounding \u201cno.\u201d4 How, then, can this be\ncompatible with his assertion that cosmic bodies form in columns like beads on a string?\nTo begin with, plasma experiments have convinced Peratt that planets and their satellites\ncan form entirely independent of any star.55 If nothing else, this would eliminate the neces-\nsity of searching for proto-Saturn\u2019s parent, a search that, even if one existed, would certainly\nprove futile in any case. But the question that this raises is: How, then, would strings of plan-\nets form?\nThe answer to this takes us back into Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s domain, concerning whom Peratt had this\nto say:",

The can was placed in the centre of an electric coil\nthrough which a strong jolt of current was passed. The can instantly collapsed, catapulted\ninto the air, and came down too hot to touch. The manner in which the can collapsed was\nthrough a pinching effect around its middle, thus forming an hour-glass shape. As Thornhill\nexplains:\n\u201cThe response to the magnetic field [generated by the coil] occurred because the can\nis a metal and can conduct electricity. In space, plasma is a conductor and behaves in\nthe same way. It is this response to the magnetic force, created by a universal or ga-\nlactic discharge, that efficiently coalesces and heats diffuse dust and gas embedded in\nplasma to form galaxies and stars, or constrains the narrow jets of active galaxies. It is\nthis mechanism also which squeezes, heats, and jets material upwards against gravity\nin a powerful lightning discharge.\u201d 8\nOr, in Peratt\u2019s words:\n\u201c[Cosmic bodies] are formed out of the original intersolar or intergalactic plasma\nthrough which the currents are flowing that causes the pinching of the plasma down\nto a dense state. Then, at least according to my book, or rather Alfv\u00e9n and the De-\npartment of Physics at the Royal Institute of Technology, matter accretes inwards to\nform \u2018planetisimals\u2019 and eventually planets.\u201d>?\nStill based on laboratory plasma experiments, this led Peratt to claim that Earth would\nhave formed at the same time that proto-Saturn itself did. As deduced \u201cfrom laboratory\nframing pictures progressing in time\u201d and \u201cscaled to planetary dimensions,\u201d\u00ae! Peratt could\nadd that:\n\u201cOriginally the plasmoids were all about the same size...But some accreted more ef-\nficiently and then cascaded to smaller terrestrials from the Giant Plasmoids [or Gas\ngiants] they had been...7his configuration could have been recorded anytime over the\ncourse of the development of man.\u201d\u00ae",

        "content": "As Peratt, however, clarified, there is no reason for a particular plasmoid to condense at\nthe same rate as the others.\u00ae In fact, in keeping with scaled-down experiments, it is found\nthat \u201call of the plasmoids or planetisimals accrete matter at different rates, some finally hav-\ning captured enough material to condense in size gravitationally.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Peratt is of the opinion that our Sun itself developed \u201cout of a cosmic\npinch.\u201d As he explained: \u201cThe planets, also created out of a cosmic pinch, presumably from\na current running parallel to the Sun\u2019s, produced a polar column of plasmoids that retained\ntheir magnetic fields, even as they contracted to planetisimals [and eventually] to planets.\u201d\u00a9\n\nThis would then explain his insistence that brown dwarfs do not emit jets, since the\nplanetary column would not have formed out of proto-Saturn but, on the contrary, proto-Sat-\nurn would have formed out of the jet. This would also explain his insistence concerning the\npre-existence of proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column.\n\nHaving spent his entire life immersed in plasma physics, it is not easy to counteract Per-\natt\u2019s claims. Even so, at this point, with so much yet to learn, a final verdict concerning the\norigin of the proto-Saturnian system would be premature. Whether cosmic bodies emit jets,\nor jets form cosmic bodies, remains temporarily unresolved. Whether the sub-brown dwarf\nthat was proto-Saturn was ejected from a star, or whether it was formed independent of any\nstar, remains outside the scope of the present work. Whether proto-Saturn ejected the plas-\nmoid that was to become Earth, to say nothing of the possibility of other planets, poleward or\notherwise, or whether proto-Saturn and its attendants all formed at the same time, will be dis-\ncussed more fully in the proposed sequel to this work.\n\nEND OF ACT ONE\n\nIn order to simplify the theory propounded in this work, our theses must now be ex-\npanded and reshuffled into a more appropriate chronological order.\n\nHypothesis #1: That the present gas giant planet we know by the name of Saturn had pre-\nviously been a sub-brown dwarf star free floating in space outside the demarcation of the\npresent Solar System.\n\nHypothesis #2: That, from what can be deduced from ancient as well as primitive astro-\nnomical lore, Earth had once been a satellite of this proto-Saturnian sub-star, which, because\nof its proximity, loomed large in the sky as a distinct disc larger than the apparent size of the\nfull Moon.\n\nHypothesis #3: That, during this period, a nebulous entity, which our ancestors had diffi-\nculty in describing clearly, surrounded the Saturnian primary. We have conjectured this en-\ntity to have been a placental cloud, or circumstellar disk, surrounding the Saturnian orb in its\nequatorial plane. This entity seems to have been that to which the ancients alluded to as\nChaos.\n\nHypothesis #4: During this same unspecified period, the Saturnian orb was seen to float\nover an apparition which, to ancient man, looked like a sheet of celestial water, a cosmic\nocean. Whether this \u201cwater\u201d was the same conjectural circumstellar disk, which would have\nhad the appearance of a celestial whirlpool, an auroral manifestation, or a combination of\nboth phenomena, is not now easily determined.\n\nHypothesis #5: That, still according to ancient astronomical lore, during this indetermi-\nnate period, Saturn was the only visible celestial body in Earth\u2019s primordial sky.",

This ray from above is\ninterpreted as a sustained plasma discharge in the form of Birkeland current, a scaled down\nversion, or the slowly deteriorating remnant, of a so-called plasma \u201cjet\u201d such as can be seen\nemanating from stellar, and even galactic, objects.\n\nHypothesis #9: That, according to some of man\u2019s earliest memories, Earth was originally\nengulfed in what our ancestors persistently referred to as darkness. This was an age which,\ndespite its remoteness in time, ended up etching itself indelibly in human consciousness. It\nwas a time during which the Sun, the Moon, and the stars were not yet visible in the sky. Sat-\nurn ruled alone.\n\nHypothesis #10: This age, we have also found out, could not have been one of total dark-\nness, and that, in fact, mankind itself remembers that the Saturnian deity actually shed a\nfeeble light. The terrestrial environment during this age was bathed in a perpetual twilight or,\nrather, a protracted dawn, which man remembered as the dawn of Creation.\n\nHypothesis #11: That both Earth and Saturn were embedded in a plasmasphere centered\non proto-Saturn, the opacity of which enabled proto-Saturn\u2019s radiation to be reflected toward\nall terrestrial latitudes.\n\nHypothesis #12: Proto-Saturn\u2019s illumination, feeble as it might have been, together with\nthe plasmasphere\u2019s opacity are recognized as the means by which the stars were kept from\nvisibility. The Sun, needless to say, was still too far to be seen, while the Moon had not yet\nbeen captured by Earth.\n\nHypothesis #13: There is also the possibility that, due to Saturn\u2019s former greater mass and\nrate of dimming, it might have been even warmer and slightly brighter in ages previous to the\nadvent of mankind.\n\nHypothesis #14: That, under the scheme described above, Earth would have received\nenough heat to sustain life. This heat would have radiated directly from proto-Saturn\u2019s close\nproximity about Earth\u2019s northern hemisphere. The southern latitude would also have received\nsufficient warmth, even if a feebler light, from the radiation that would have been reflected\noff the inner surface of proto-Saturn\u2019s plasmasphere with which Earth would have been en-\nveloped. In the northern hemisphere, this indirect radiation would have added to the direct\nheat and light received from above Earth\u2019s northern pole. Thus, during this time, Earth\u2019s cli-\nmatic environment would have been one without seasonal change, luxuriating in one single\nseason of eternal spring. (It should, however, be noted that Earth would also have been sub-\njected to slightly different latitudinal temperatures.) Tropical and/or sub-tropical flora and\nfauna were thus able to thrive in Earth\u2019s northern region, even within the present Arctic\ncircle, and the possibility exists that this flora and fauna originated in these regions before\nmigrating to more southerly latitudes. Judging by palaeontological remains in Earth\u2019s geo-\nlogic strata, this environment stretched back into the remote past, possibly as far as the Cre-\ntaceous Period, definitely as far as the Paleocene Epoch of the Tertiary Period. Exactly what\nsituation prevailed before that remains to be examined, but since Earth is postulated to have\nbeen a satellite of proto-Saturn from its very onset, it becomes evident that all past ages prior\nto the Pleistocene, including the origin of life, must be reconsidered under this hypothesized\nscheme.\n\n491",

It was at this time that ancient man was able to catch a glimpse of the slowly ap-\nproaching Sun, at first appearing no bigger than a star, but growing ever larger and brighter.\n\nOne question that pops up at this point, and one that I have often been asked, is: What\nwas man doing during this time of free wandering through space? And my answer has always\nbeen: Nothing much. Men, women, and children went about their business, whatever that\nmight have been, entirely indifferent to the Saturnian apparition towering above them. And\nwhy should they have paid it any heed?\n\nIn our present situation, the Sun rises, traverses the sky, and sets. It appears red on rising,\na blinding yellow throughout most of the day, and dims back to red on setting. The Moon\nalso rises and sets, appears of an orange color and illusively larger when nearer the horizon,\nturning to yellow and then white as it gains height in the sky. Unlike the Sun, it can be seen,\nwhen seen at all, during both day and night. More importantly, it grows and diminishes as an\nexpanding and contracting crescent, appearing as a full circular orb in between, and does so\nonce every month. At times the Moon is seen passing in front of the Sun, causing a partial,\nannular, or total eclipse. At other times, Earth itself comes directly between the Sun and the\nMoon, casting its shadow across the face of our lunar neighbor, thus causing a partial or total\nlunar eclipse. These are events that would have mesmerized our primitive ancestors, as in\nfact, in later times, they did.\n\nPrior to its actual shining as a sun of night, proto-Saturn would have been bereft of any\nsuch changes. Until that time, it did not even brighten and dim. It just hung there, doing\nnothing. True, had it to suddenly re-appear in this modern age, its towering apparition would\nawe us, but only because we are now used to a different sky. Those who were born, brought\nup, and lived beneath its splendor would have simply taken it for granted for the simple rea-\nson that it had always been there.\n\nAs mentioned before, those who might have dared approach the shining ray from above\nwould have first felt the wind that would have enveloped the far outer fringes of the plasma\ndischarge; they would have heard the electrical hum emanating from it; and they would have\nexperienced the prickling of their scalp and the hairs on their body due to electrical excita-\ntion. Both man and beast alike would have known better than to approach nearer.\n\nOne could also ask: Did man even inhabit such northern regions in those far off times?\nWhy not\u2014especially since the Arctic was the warmest place on Earth? Stone tools, similar to\nthose retrieved in East Africa, obviously worked by man, have been unearthed in fifteen dif-\nferent sites beneath the permafrost in present Siberia.\u00a9\u2019 Traces of Stone Age settlements,\ncontaining \u201cbone implements and arrowheads, as well as needles and axes skillfully fash-\nioned from mammoth tusks,\u201d have been found in the New Siberian Islands.\u00ae Prehistoric\npetroglyphs depicting the \u201cwell-preserved incised outlines of whales and deer\u201d are still to be",
