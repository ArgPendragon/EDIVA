Despite Owen Gingerich\u2019s claim that the geocentric\nworld view \u201cwas almost universally accepted in his day,\u201d\"* when Ptolemy presented Earth as\nthe centre of the universe with the planets revolving around it, he was rejecting what had al-\nready been deduced before his time. Having considered the heliocentric system advocated by\nhis forebears, he disqualified it since the implied violent rotation of Earth as deduced from\nAristotle\u2019s physics seemed to Ptolemy to be contrary to observation. The way he reasoned\nwas that Earth\u2019s rotation would have left \u201cthe animals and other weights...hanging in the\nair.\u201d Earth itself, he reasoned, \u201cwould very quickly fall out of the heavens.\u201d As he stated:\n\u201cMerely to conceive such things makes them appear ridiculous.\u201d\nAs Carl Sagan correctly noted, in rejecting the earlier belief that the planets revolved\naround the Sun, Ptolemy was responsible for preventing \u201cthe advance of astronomy for a\nmillennium.\u201d' Thus, Robert Newton may not have been too harsh in his judgement when he\nclaimed that Ptolemy \u201chas caused us to lose much of the genuine work in Greek astronomy\u201d\nand that it would have been better for astronomy had the Almagest never been written.\"\nWhat, then, was this ancient Greek astronomy that Ptolemy sought to supersede? How\nsuperior was it to that espoused by Ptolemy?\nTHE HELIOCENTRIC SYSTEM\nMany an authority on the subject of ancient Greek astronomy has in years past stressed\nthe primitive nature of their knowledge. Many of them have relied on the oft-repeated dictum\nthat \u201cthe world according to Homer\u201d consisted of a round, but flat, Earth overarched by a\nsemi-spherical sky in which the gods had fashioned their various domains. But even as early\nas 1881, apparently to the unconcern of various authorities who came after him, Simon New-\ncomb had already warned against this erroneous belief. As he wrote:\n\u201cNot enough credit has been given to the ancient astronomers. For instance, there was\nno time within the scope of history when it was not known that the earth is a sphere,\nand that the direction down at different points is toward the same point at the earth\u2019s\ncentre. Current teaching in the text-books as to the knowledge of astronomy by the\nancients is at fault.\u201d\"\u00b0\nThe discovery that the Sun, rather than Earth, was the body at the center of the Solar\nSystem has for long been attributed to the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Koppernigk, popularly\nknown as Copernicus (1473-1543).

He also knew that, on the same day at Alexandria, a vertical staff\ncast a short shadow. From this\u2014a shadow in one place but no shadow in another on the same\nday \u2014Eratosthenes first verified that Earth was indeed spherical. Then, knowing the distance\nbetween Syene and Alexandria, which was measured at 5,000 stadia, and using some simple\ngeometry, he realized that this was 7\u00b0, or close to 1/50 of a great circle. He thus arrived at the\nfigure of 250,000 stadia, which he subsequently corrected to 252,000 stadia, as the circum-\nference of Earth. When translated into miles or kilometers, his result was only a few percent\noff the mark.\nIt was on thus discovering the vastness of the world he lived on that Eratosthenes became\nconvinced of the immensity of the universe.\nINCLINATION TO THE SOUTH\nThe Greeks were also aware that Earth\u2019s axis was inclined, and that it was inclined \u201cto-\nward the south.\u201d As Plutarch wrote:\n\u201cDiogenes and Anaxagoras affirm that, after the world was composed and the earth\nhad produced living creatures, the world out of its own propensity made an inclina-\ntion towards the south.\u201d\nUnfortunately, Plutarch, bless his soul, was not only not an astronomer, he was not much\nof a geographer either. So he did make something of a mess when it came to explaining the\nreasons behind Earth\u2019s inclination and, especially, when he attempted to account for its ef-\nfects. On the other hand, come to think of it, perhaps Plutarch should not be blamed too much\nfor these misunderstandings since, in some instances, he actually claimed that he was but re-\npeating what others had asserted. '\u201d\nTHE PRECESSION OF THE EQUINOXES\nBesides being inclined, Earth\u2019s axis spins in a strange fashion which has often been com-\npared to that of a spinning top. Rather than rotating in a rigid manner, Earth\u2019s axis also wob-\nbles in such a way that its imaginary tip describes a circle of its own. In effect, the axis pre-\ncesses around the vertical so that it traces out a cone in space. This additional axial rotation\nthus causes an apparent shift of the stars, as viewed from Earth, which is different from the\napparent daily revolution of the stars around the pole. Whereas the daily rotation causes the\nstars to seem to revolve around the Pole Star, precession causes the Pole Star itself to revolve\nin a circle of 231/2\u00b0 radius. Thus, throughout the years, the Pole Star is seen to shift and leave\nthe north celestial pole. If another star is then in the right position, it becomes the new Pole\nStar. At present, the Pole Star is alpha Ursae Minoris, but, at the time of the Greek astrono-\nmers we are presently concerned with, it would have been beta Ursae Minoris. In 3000 B.C.,\nit would have been alpha Draconis. It was not just the pole stars, however, that slowly\n\u201cpassed away,\u201d but the entire sky and, with it, its entire denizens. This movement, however,\nis very slow in execution, requiring 26,000 years in order to complete one full circle. The\nmotion does not, therefore, lend itself to easy detection. Nor, for that matter, does the resul-\ntant change\u2014except over thousands of years. Needless to say, no one person can live long\nenough to detect the change. And yet, not only was this change detected, so was the preces-\nsional motion that gives rise to it. The discovery is attributed to one of the greatest astrono-",
