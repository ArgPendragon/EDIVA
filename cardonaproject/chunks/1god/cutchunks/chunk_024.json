    "content": "this point, delve into Mesoamerican lore to uphold the thesis being developed, since I would\nlike to reserve that for a later part of this work. But it would do no harm here to note that in\nanalysing the Mayan holy book known as the Popul Vuh, which, among other things, deals\nwith the glowing face of the sun, it comes out unreservedly that certainly it was not the same\nsun which we see.'\u201d\n\nWould it then be too much to consider what appears to be the only other alternative\u2014that\nwhat the ancients believed was indeed what they, or their ancestors, had actually seen and\nexperienced?\n\nBefore we answer that question, let us consider one additional point. The ancients did not\nmerely maintain that Saturn was, or had been, a sun. They alluded to it as such as if it was, or\nonce had been, general knowledge; as if everyone knew that this was, or had been, the case.\nNo explanations, clarifications, or qualified rationalizations are ever encountered to account\nfor the phenomenon. But, whether speaking of the Saturnian god as distinct from his lumin-\nary or of the luminary that was Saturn itself, it was always accepted that deity and planet,\nwhich in reality were one, coruscated, or had once coruscated, as a true sun. Personally, this\nwas one aspect concerning the Saturnian phenomenon which further convinced me that not\nonly did the ancients mean exactly what they \u201csaid,\u201d but that they probably knew what they\nwere \u201ctalking\u201d about. But what, exactly, did this amount to?\n\nAt this point we had best lay the cards we have so far accumulated plainly on the table.\nWe have, I believe, supplied ample evidence (and more will be forthcoming in the chapters\nthat follow) to indicate that the ancients believed Saturn to have once radiated as a sun. As\nHodder Westropp and Staniland Wake had concluded long before Jastrow on studying an-\ncient symbolism, as far as the ancients were concerned, Saturn was the first irradiator of\nlight.'* But a question we posed earlier remains unanswered. This concerns the sharing of\nnames between Saturn and the Sun. But then, what is true\u2014that Saturn was given the former\nname of the Sun, or that the Sun was given the former name of Saturn?\n\nBoll seems to have had no doubts about this. As far as he was concerned, the Greek Hel-\nios and the Latin Sol were originally the names of the planet Saturn.\u201d Here I would like to\nmention the cult of Sol Invictus, the Unconquered Sun, which did not gain significant ascen-\ndancy until the third century A. D. Both the cult and the festivals associated with it were es-\ntablished by the Emperor Aurelian (Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, also known as Elagabalus)\nand celebrated on the 25th of December\u2019\u00ae\u2014what to the Western World today is Christmas.\nAs Roger Wescott asked, why would the Sun have been deemed unconquered. \u201cThe common\nassumption about this theonymic phrase,\u201d wrote Wescott, \u201cis that it could be loosely equated\nwith \u2018the invincible sun\u2019.\u201d*' Wescott, however, was \u201cinclined\u201d to take the term literally. In\nwhich case the question could be asked: Was there also a cult of Sol Victus\u2014\u201cthe conquered\nSun\u201d? As Wescott concluded: \u201cAlthough this latter phrase [i.e. Sol Victus] does not occur in\nRoman literature, the phrase Sol Indigetes is found, referring to an older sun-god.\u201d\u201d\n\nIt can therefore be conjectured that in each case where Saturn and the Sun share the same\nname, the name originally belonged to Saturn. This suspicion moves closer to certainty when\nwe realize that, while every major ancient name of the Sun was also bestowed on Saturn, not\nevery ancient name of the planet Saturn was bestowed on the Sun. The certainty grows when,",

He was honored as a\nsun of night.\u2019\nStudents of Egyptian mythology have long grappled with the exact meaning that\nlies hidden beneath this strange characteristic. The best that Wallis Budge could offer by way\nof an explanation was that Atum,, whom he referred to by the name\u2019s former reading of\nof an explanation was that Atum, whom he referred to by the name\u2019s former reading of\nTemu, was the Sun after it had set.  ?

Sun worship at night, however, makes for an\nincongruous institution. This fallacious interpretation should never have been derived, and it\nwould not have, had the Egyptologists thought of comparing their texts more diligently with\nthose in the hands of the Assyriologists.\nThere has never been any doubt that, as far as the Egyptians themselves were concerned,\nAtum \u201cwas held to be one of the forms of the great Sun-god Ra..   .\u201d?

While this seems to\nhave really been the case, it must not be assumed that the assimilation was an arbitrary one.\nThis assimilation resulted in the double god known as Atum-Ra (or Ra-Atum)\u2019 as indicated\nHere, perhaps, we could add that Ra was also worshipped by  the  same name in\nin the hymn contained in the Papyrus of Mut-hetep\u00ae and elsewhere.\nHere, perhaps, we could add that Ra was also worshipped by the same name in\nMesopotamia,  although his Semitic equivalent, El, was more popular.\u201d This  should not\nMesopotamia, although his Semitic equivalent, El, was more popular.\u201d This should not\nsurprise us.

George Rawlinson, writing in 1885, who\ndid not accept the identification of god with planet, had this to say concerning this ancient\nbelief:\n\u201cThe identification of the Chaldean II [i.e. El] or Ra with Saturn, which Diodorus\nmakes, and which may seem to derive some confirmation from Philo-Byblius, is cer-\ntainly incorrect, so far as the planet Saturn, which Diodorus especially mentions, is\nconcerned; but it may be regarded as having a basis of truth, inasmuch as Saturn was\nin one sense the chief of the gods...\u201d\u201d\u201d\nThis, however, seems to have been the bane of mythologists from day one, in that they\nhave always had the audacity to proclaim that, thousands of years after the fact, they are in a\nbetter position to know what the ancients believed than the very ancients themselves. Given\nall this, may we not assume that Atum, who was but a facet of Ra, had also originated as a\npersonification of the planet Saturn.? But then, if Atum was honored as a sun of night, should\nwe not expect that so, also, had been Ra? This is exactly what we find. In a hymn, Ra is\nlauded as \u201cthe one alone... lying awake while all men lie asleep.\u201d And if some find that\nsomewhat ambiguous, it is made clearer in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, where the god in\nquestion is unambiguously made to state: \u201cI am that god Re who shineth in the night.\u201d\nBesides Atum and Ra, this sun of night was also anthropomorphosed by the Egyptians as\nthe god Osiris. Mariette-Bey long ago wrote that: \u201cOriginally, Osiris is the nocturnal sun; he\nis the primordial night of chaos; he is consequently anterior to Ra, the Sun of Day.\u201d * As we\nhave already seen, however, Ra, also, was considered a sun of night so that, in this respect,",
