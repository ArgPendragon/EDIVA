(It has always fascinated me that such extraterrestri-\nals would have bestowed such astronomical knowledge to the ancestors of the Dogon,\nknowledge which was of no practical use to them, while giving them nothing that might have\nalleviated the precarious living of their Stone Age primitiveness.)\nOthers would rather have the Dogon educated in these matters by other sorts of visiting\naliens\u2014Christian missionaries from the West. The missionary campaign in tropical Africa,\nhowever, did not commence in earnest until the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century.\nBut this is neither here nor there because, to be sure, the Sudan, including Mali, had much\nearlier come under the influence of Islam, so that no Christian influence could have pene-\ntrated the region\u2014and this despite the fact that the rural areas, such as the one occupied by\nthe Dogon, continued to stick to their traditional animistic ways.\u00ae! And, in any case, would\nmissionaries, Christian or otherwise, bent on converting primitive peoples to their faith, have\nfilled the minds of these natives with astronomical knowledge? Or why was this knowledge,\nas adhered to by these natives, first reported to the outside world by missionaries who were\nas confounded by the knowledge as were later astronomers?\nOne other alternative that has been proposed is that the ancestors of the Dogon had been\nin possession of optical instruments. However, even Galileo, with his pioneering telescope,\nwas not able to see Saturn as a ringed orb. In fact, the image of Saturn that he was capable of\nresolving through his optical instrument was so vague that he mistook the planet for three\nseparate bodies. As he himself reported:\n\u201cI have observed with great admiration that Saturn is not a single star but three to-\ngether, which, as it were, touch each other...the middle being much larger than the\nlateral ones...by employing a glass which multiplies the superficies [i.e., visible\nboundaries] more than a thousand times, the three globes will be seen very distinctly\nand almost touching, with only a small dark space between them.\u201d &\nIt was not until 1655 that Christian Huygens, with a better instrument, was able to report\n(through his now famous encoded message) that Saturn was actually \u201cgirdled by a thin flat\nring, nowhere touching, inclined to the ecliptic.\u201d\nIs it then probable that the Dogon, who are still living in their primitive mud huts as I\nwrite this, could have been in possession of a better telescope than the one utilized by Gali-\nleo?\nTHE STAR OF NINE MOONS\nThe Efe Pygmies of the Ituri Forest in the eastern portion of Africa\u2019s Congo basin in\nwhat is now Upper Zaire have been unceremoniously relegated by most anthropologists to\nthe lowest rungs of human evolution.

But even if there is a grain of truth in these legends, it still\nwould not have enabled the Efe Pygmies, or their ancestors, to see the satellites surrounding\nthe planet Saturn. So where did that information come from?\nWhen all is said and done, the only other alternative left to explain the Dogon and Efe\nPygmy knowledge of Saturn\u2019s ring structure and its satellites is that their ancestors had, in a\nfar off time, been able to view the planet at closer proximity\u2014which would mean that,\nsomehow, Earth had been much closer to Saturn than it is at present. As outlandish as this\nidea may appear, there seems to be no other resolution to the problem\u2014which brings to mind\nthe oft-repeated words of Arthur Conan Doyle: \u201cWhen you have eliminated the impossible,\nwhatever remains, however improbable, has to be the truth.\u201d7! Besides, as forthcoming\nchapters will indicate, everything else that our ancient forefathers had to say about this planet\ncontinues to strengthen the supposition.\nTHIRD INTERLUDE\nScience has forgotten Oskar Reichenbach who, as far back as 1884, had proposed a the-\nory purporting to prove that land masses on Earth have rifted and moved northward.\u201d His\nideas can therefore be said to have preceded the similar ones of Alfred Wegener, himself rel-\negated to a footnote in the annals of science as the originator of the Continental Drift Theory,\nby some 33 years. But, more than that, Reichenbach was of the belief that, in the past, the So-\nlar System had experienced a series of catastrophic events.\u201d? Basing his conclusions on the\nimperfect knowledge of his time, he had also formulated certain theories concerning the\nplanet Saturn. As wrong as he might have been, and I am not here concemed with defending\nReichenbach, he hit on the novel idea that Earth is \u201can offspring of Saturn,\u201d\u201d4 by which he\nmeant to imply that Earth had once been a satellite of the giant gas planet.\nReichenbach, he hit on the novel idea that Earth is \u201can offspring of Saturn,\u201d74 by which he\nWhether Immanuel Velikovsky was aware of Reichenbach\u2019s wild theory or not must\nremain a moot question but, many years later, he, too, came to the same conclusion.

At one\ntime, because of the manner in which he was treated by academia, Velikovsky threatened to\ntake his Saturnian thesis with him to the grave but, as matters turned out, reason prevailed\nand he was able to expand and finalize his hypothesis under the title of Saturn and the Flood\nand Jupiter of the Thunderbolt, a title which was later changed to In the Beginning. As of this\nwriting, this work still has to see the light of day.\n\nIn 1971, however, Velikovsky gave a lecture at the University of the New World in\nValais, Switzerland, in which he presented a synopsis of his unpublished Saturnian scenario.\nAmong the items he disclosed there was the hypothesis that Earth might once have been a\nsatellite of Saturn.7> The lecture was later transcribed by Jan Sammer and appeared as an ar-\nticle in KRONOS.7\u00a9\n\nIndependent of Velikovsky, but basing their work on his as also on the mytho-historical\nrecord, Harold Tresman and Bernard Newgrosh (writing under the name of Brendan\nO\u2019Gheoghan), also came to the conclusion that Earth must once have orbited Saturn as a\nsatellite,\u201d\u2019 a topic to which Tresman was later to return.78\n\nIn analyzing the ambiguous, but tantalizing, planetary system proposed by Philolaos, the\nPythagorean philosopher from Southern Italy who lived in the time of Socrates, Lynn Rose\ncame to the same conclusion. Although this system of Philolaos had long been relegated to\nthe library of Classical curiosities, Rose was able to recapture what it might have once in-\ntended to portray. Although what resulted was a Saturnian scenario the details of which are at\nvariance with the one being presented here, it still contains some of its basic elements. As\nRose explained: \u201cAccording to the conventional interpretation, the system of Philolaos had\nEarth in orbit around a Central Fire...\u201d79 Since the Sun was described as orbiting this Central\nFire\u00ae\u00b0 it becomes obvious that the Central Fire could not have been the Sun. An in-depth\nstudy of this system, together with his privileged knowledge of Velikovsky\u2019s unpublished\nwork on the subject, enabled Rose to conclude that this Central Fire was Saturn shining as a\n\u201csun,\u201d and that Earth was in those days in orbit around it.!\n\nCombining Velikovsky\u2019s postulate with that of David Talbott and others, Frederick Hall\nembraced the same idea, presenting it in a speculative scenario concerning the history of the\nSolar System.\u00ae2\n\nCertain fundamentals, based on specific proposals offered by others, are here accepted,\nbut also tested against the record. The hypothesis that Earth had once been a satellite of Sat-\nurn, which originally came to this author via Velikovsky, is one of them. Additional research\nconducted independently by the present author has led to the same conclusion. This research\nhas however made it apparent that prehistoric man, ignorant of astronomical matters, would\nnot have been able to deduce that his world was a satellite of another planet. But, being close\nenough to Saturn, he would have been able to view that planet as something much bigger\nthan the present pin-point of light we see in the night sky. Saturn, in fact, would have loomed\nlarge in the sky as a disk, or sphere, much larger than that of the present full Moon. And this",
