    "content": "\nEven the modern theory of the formation of planets by aggregation, whether it will even-\ntually turn out to be correct or not, was foreseen by Democritus:\n\u201c.,..worlds are produced when many bodies are congregated and flow together from\nthe surrounding space to a common point, so that by mutual contact they made sub-\nstances of the same figure and similar in form come into connection; and when thus\nintertwined, there are transmutations into other bodies, and that created things wax\nand wane through necessity.\u201d\"\u00a9\nLIFE ON OTHER PLANETS\nGiordano Bruno was not as lucky as Anaxagoras. He had no Pericles to save him from\nthose in authority. In A.D. 1600, Bruno was burned alive at the stake by the Catholic Inquisi-\ntion for espousing the belief, among other things, that other worlds must necessarily harbor\nother life. The belief that life exists on other planets did not, however, originate with him. As\nfar back as the fourth century B.C., Metrodorus of Chios had already written that: \u201cTo con-\nsider the Earth the only populated world in infinite space is as absurd as to assert that in an\nentire field sown with seed, only one grain will grow.\u201d'\u201d\nTHE BABYLONIAN PRECEDENCE\nWe have come a long way in analyzing the astronomical knowledge of ancient peo-\nples\u2014from eye-witness reports of meteors and the metallic structure of meteorites to the cor-\nrect motions of the heavenly bodies; from the calculation of complex calendrical systems to\nthe prediction of solar and lunar eclipses; from the intricacies of Mesoamerican computations\nto the Greek passion for exactitude and philosophical daring. I therefore hope that when, in\nthe following chapters, the main thesis of this work is revealed, no one will counter its reve-\nlations by objecting that the ancients had very little astronomical knowledge at their disposal\nto be taken seriously.\nIt is, moreover, accepted that this ancient knowledge was not necessarily the property of\nthe masses. Nor was it all necessarily adhered to by every scholar of the time. The man in the\nstreet, always prone to age-old superstitions, had little mind of astronomical matters. But, to\nan extent, this was not much different than it is at present.\nMeanwhile, competing theoreticians were very often contradicted by others. Plutarch, for\ninstance, delighted in enumerating the various and contradictory theories concerning the na-\nture of comets, some of which theories were hilarious even by the standards of his day. And,\nas we have seen, while the Greeks were quite aware of Earth\u2019s axial tilt, they fell far short\nwhen it came to explaining the reason behind it.\nCan it, however, be said that all modern astronomers agree on each and every astronomi-\ncal issue, or that some of their theories have not been, or will not be, found to be in error?\nWhy should we expect more stringent standards from our ancient forebears? Have we not\nalready seen that many of the great astronomical break-throughs and theories\u2014even that\nconcerning the Big Bang \u2014were originally discovered, or thought of, by these very ancients?\nIt is no secret\u2014and it never has been\u2014that the Greeks learned, and borrowed, much of\ntheir astronomical knowledge from the Babylonians. Nor, unlike many of their modern\ncounterparts, did they ever try to hide the fact. As Alexander Jones noted: \u201cThe Greek as-",
