This \u201cfossilized\u201d magnetism\noceurs when iron-bearing rocks are molten and then quickly cool, thus trapping the orienta-\ntion of Earth\u2019s field at the time of cooling. Known as paleomagnetism, the orientation of the\nfield can be deduced if and when the original position of such rocks can be determined. If,\nthen, the age of such rocks can also be deduced, the orientation of the field, and so the local-\nity of the old geomagnetic poles, can also be dated. When this was accomplished, it became\nevident that the geomagnetic poles must have wandered over the terrestrial surface. More\nimportantly, the parameters enumerated above allows the path of the magnetic pole to be\ntraced through the ages and plotted on a map. Jean Andrews, among others, was able to trace\nthis path for the past 180 million years which she dutifully plotted on just such a map.\n\nAndrews\u2019 research led her to the conclusion that \u201cthe whole earth (or at least the mantle\nand the overlying lithospheric plates)\u201d tumbled.\u00b0> The cause for this, according\nto her, is the same geoid highs offered earlier by Anderson which cause an imbalance due to\nmass redistribution on Earth\u2019s surface.* This mechanism, which had been offered by others\nbefore her,*\u2019 is explained by Andrews through the following analogy:\n\n\u201cImagine a homogeneous plastically deformable sphere rotating in space. A dot is\npainted at the rotation axis, the sphere\u2019s north pole. If a bug placed on the equator\n to-\nward the dot at the pole, it will in fact never leave the equator defined by the spin\naxis. Rather, the sphere will tumble, with the dot moving toward the bug, while the\nrotation axis remains fixed in space.\u201d 8\n\nOf course, following Anderson, Andrews was sure to note that Earth is nor a homogene-\nous sphere while the equatorial bulge would tend to stabilize Earth and keep it from tum-\nbling. As she herself, however, retorts: \u201cNevertheless, the pole can shift through a large\nangle, even with only a small mass redistribution, as long as the bulge is \u2018plastic\u2019 and not\n\u2018frozen\u2019 9\n\nAndrews\u2019 findings delivered such an impact that the editors of Scientific American pre-\nsented her hypothesis as fact. Even so, the question has to be asked: What is the cause of\ngeoid highs and mass redistribution? What causes these areas of higher density? Together\nwith his colleagues, R. Sabadini is of the opinion that mass redistribution is the result of\nmantle flow instabilities,\u00ae! which is not really saying much.\n\nOf more importance to our own hypothesis, however, is the actual path of the magnetic\npole traced by Andrews for the last 180 million years.

All three of them, as well\nas the rest, are within the Arctic Circle\u2014that is these ancient magnetic poles were already\nwithin the Arctic Circle at the times supplied by Andrews. So that, even if her plotting is\ncorrect, all this pole-wandering would still not resolve the problem concerning the existence\nof sub-tropical faunal and floral remains within the High Arctic regions. As with Hapgood\u2019s\nearlier paths, the most extensive of these polar wanderings would merely have shifted the\nlatitude of Winnipeg close to that of Ellesmere Island. Somehow, I cannot see crocodiles,\niemurs, and palm trees thriving in the present latitude of Winnipeg. Thus, as with other\ntheories of polar wandering, these pole shifts would srill have fallen short of moving sub-\ntropical areas into the Arctic Circle.\n\nAnd then, how valid is a theory based on the hypothesized link between Earth\u2019s\ngeomagnetic pole and its axis of rotation? As already noted, Earth\u2019s geomagnetic pole is\nseparated from its axis of rotation by 11\u00b0. Nor is it even fixed\u2014it wanders around. In Jupi-\nter\u2019s case, the tilt of its south pole does coincide with its geomagnetic one; but at the north\npole, the geomagnetic and spin axes vary by 10\u00b0. That of Uranus is tilted a walloping 59\u00b0\nfrom the planet\u2019s axis of rotation.\u00a9? This was at first thought to be due to the fact that Uranus\nis tilted on its side. Neptune, however, is not lying on its side and yet its magnetic field is\nalso tilted a walloping 47\u00b0 from its axis of rotation. @ [t cannot therefore be an inviolable law\nthat geomagnetic poles should coincide with, or otherwise be linked to, geographic ones, that\nis axes of rotation. True, Saturn\u2019s magnetic field is closely aligned with its spin axis\u2014~ being\nseparated by less than 1\u00b0\u2014but this seems to be unique among the planets of the Solar Sys-\ntem. Moreover, Saturn\u2019s magnetic field is stronger at the north pole than at the south (0.69\ngauss as opposed to 0.53 gauss), which is equivalent to the centre of the field being displaced\n2400 km north along the planet\u2019s axis. (Whether the anomaly of this magnetic field has\nmeaning for the thesis proposed in this work remains to be seen.)\n\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field is said to be produced by a dynamo effect involving its molten\ncore within the rapidly spinning planet. This mechanism, however, only seems to work in\nEarth\u2019s case. The core of a small planet like Mercury, for instance, would have cooled off\nlong ago; its spin is nearly 60 times slower than Earth\u2019s. For these reasons, Mercury was be-\nlieved not to have a magnetic field. And yet, as it was ultimately discovered, it does. As\nClark Chapman was forced to state: \u201cIn the case of Mercury, more than a decade of subse-\nquent thinking about Mariner 10\u2019s discoveries has still not yielded a clear understanding of\nwhat\u2019s going on inside the planet.\u201d6+\n\nOnly in the case of Mercury?\u2014one might ask. Take the case of Venus, for instance: If a\nslow spinning planet with a cold core, like Mercury, can generate a magnetic field, then Ve-\nnus, much larger and with molten iron in its core, should, despite its slow spin, also generate\na magnetic field. How is it then that its magnetic field is close to being non-existent?\u2122\n\nMars does not only have a weak magnetic field, it is said to be fading. At first, this mag-\nnetic field was thought to swing wildly from one spot to another so that future \u201cBoy Scouts\non Mars won\u2019t be able to use compasses to get around...\u201d But it was later discovered that the\npattern of the detected magnetism, imbedded in surface rocks, is not so jumbled after all.\nMore than that, the magnetism in these rocks is said to be \u201c40 times stronger than similar ar-\n\n8, p. 62.\n\n63 E, Burgess, Farther Encounter:, p. 79.\n\n64 \u00a9.

Suffice it to say that Schultz, as also Lutz, were\nsatisfied that polar wandering had indeed taken place on Mars.\u00ae As Schultz stated in conclu-\nsion: \u201cThe hypothesis that the Martian poles have wandered is supported by a good deal of\nevidence, and it offers new explanations for many of the planet\u2019s enigmatic features.\u201d85\n\nWhat was the mechanism offered by Schultz to account for this Martian polar wandering?\nThe mechanism he offered was a reversion to Anderson\u2019s proposed method concerning \u201cthe\nredistribution of mass within a planet or on its surface.\u201d\u00ae His supposition is that: \u201cThe sta-\nblest alignment for a spinning object is the one in which the most massive parts of the object\nare farthest from its axis or rotation.\u201d87\n\n\u201cWhen geologic forces place a large mass at or near a planet\u2019s surface at a point far\nfrom the equator, the spinning motion of the planet becomes unstable, like the un-\nstable motion of an improperly balanced bearing or top. If the planet is not entirely\nrigid, the crust shifts to move the anomalous mass toward the equator. As the crust of\nthe planet shifts, the spin axis retains its alignment in space and the poles wander over\nthe planet\u2019s surface.\u201d 88\n\nEven so, Schultz was astute enough to submit a caveat:\n\n\u201cTf the lithosphere of the planet is very flexible, polar wandering does not take place,\nbecause any excess mass sinks into the surface before the crust has had time to rea-\nlign itself. There can be no polar wandering on a completely rigid planet either, be-\ncause the lithosphere cannot realign itself at all.\u201d\u00ae9\n\nThis, then, would seem to invalidate Anderson\u2019s theory re the cause behind terrestrial\nwandering as discussed above and with which we are actually concerned. The case of Mars is\nsomewhat different in that the planet\u2019s lithosphere displays both rigid and flexible features.\nThere are ancient lava-filled basins that have been partly isostatically compensated together\nwith volcanic and tectonic regions which have not been compensated at all. Schultz\u2019s own\nconclusion, as it applies to Mars, is that the \u201cchange in mass distribution that is necessary to\nproduce polar wandering could have been provided by convection in the mantle (the rising of\nhot sections and the sinking of colder ones), by a redistribution of mass due to the impact of\nlarge objects or by the filling with lava of the resulting impact basins.\u201d\n\n\u201cConvection in the mantle\u201d would not, however, induce polar wandering on Earth for the\nsimple reason that, as Schultz himself warned, \u201cany excess mass\u201d thus produced would tend\n\n82 Tbid., pp. 98-99.\n\n83 Tbid., pp. 99-102.\n\n&4 See here also, B.

Alter-\nnating intervals of high and low topographic relief of the earth\u2019s surface, variation in\nheat due to internal radioactivity of the earth, changes in the composition of the at-\nmosphere, variation in radiation from the sun, astronomical and cosmical changes,\npresence of large amounts of volcanic dust in the earth\u2019s atmosphere and variations in\ncirculation patterns are some of the causes that have been evoked to explain the\nchanges.\u201d%3\n\nDurham could have added the theories of polar wandering and the shifting crust, to say\nnothing of axial tilts, to his list; his conclusion would not have been affected. More than four\ndecades later, paleoclimatologists and paleontologists remain in a quandary as to the actual\nmechanism that would have caused tropical and sub-tropical flora and fauna to thrive in what\nare now the two coldest areas on Earth.\n\nDoes not our own hypothesis which posits the Saturnian sun, a former brown dwarf star,\nto have been permanently stationed in Earth\u2019s north celestial pole, bathing the northem re-\ngions, especially the Arctic circle, with constant light and heat, more readily fill the bill?\nWould not such a milieu account for the sub-tropical plants in the Arctic which, in turn, fed\nthe sub-tropical animals that thrived within the same region? Would not such a system, en-\ncased in a plasma sheath, with perhaps an Earth possessing a denser atmosphere than at pre-\nsent, have also ensured a sub-tropical climate in all latitudes, including Earth\u2019s south pole?\nWould not this also account for the growing consensus among paleontologists that such sub-\ntropical flora and fauna originated in the Arctic from where they extended themselves farther\nsouth? Wandering poles would not then be called for; neither would a shifting crust or a\ntilting of the axis.\n\n91 For a detailed history concerning theories of polar wandering, the reader is referred to J. White, Pole Shift\n(N. Y., 1980).\n\n%2 J. W. Durham, \u201cPaleoclimates,\u201d, p.\n809,\n\n%3 Ibid., pp. 820-821.\n\n404",

                "content": "hen I first introduced the Saturnian system to the general public in 1978, I myself\ndescribed it as one which \u201cinspires disbelief and contradicts every known tenet of\ncelestial mechanics as we believe in them today.\u201d To which I added:\n\n\u201cThis unique positioning of Saturn [i.e., its axial coupling with Earth] has been the\ngreatest stumbling block in the unraveling of the Saturnian mystery. We are also\naware that this supposition is open to the greatest criticism.\u201d\n\nSince then, I have continued to refer to the Saturnian system, model, and scenario as be-\ning bizarre in the extreme.\n\nThe problem did not merely consist of the fact that there were no such coupled bodies\nknown from anywhere in the Universe, let alone in the Solar System; it also consisted of the\nsupposition that celestial mechanics, as then known, would not allow for such a coupling. An\nadded problem was the fact that, in the 1970s, neither of the two main proponents of the Sat-\nurn theory, David Talbott and myself, were experts in celestial mechanics. Thus, when John\nGibson asked Talbott in an interview whether he thought that any astrophysicist could possi-\nbly accept the Saturn theory, Talbott replied with the words:\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, I\u2019m going to go ahead...and not even worry about the physics of\nit all. Let\u2019s face it: within any established frame of thought the whole thing is hilari-\nous. How could two planets rotate on the same axis in any stable configura-\ntion...Does that sound like something one could defend in any terms acceptable to\nmodern astronomy?\u201d3\n\nAnd, when Gibson came close to insisting that Talbott \u201cshould suggest some physical\nprinciple which might account for the planetary configuration\u201d he was describing, Talbott\nemphatically replied with: \u201cNo, absolutely not.\u201d And added: \u201cThat would only make things\nworse. I\u2019m not a physicist.\u201d*\n\nNot happy with Talbott\u2019s decision to avoid any attempt to solve the problem, I decided to\naccost some orthodox authorities with this mechanical conundrum. Five of them promised to\nlook into the matter despite their obvious disbelief, although they all compelled me to keep\ntheir names out of the literature, at least until such time as their endeavors showed any\n\n1p, Cardona, \u201cThe Mystery of the Pleiades,\u201d KRONOS III:4, p. 38.\n\n2 Ibid.\n\n3D.

                "content": "Throughout the years there were various boid endeavors, and even a few competing theo-\nTies, all vying to resolve the axial and other dilemmas of the Saturnian, or Saturnian-like,\nconfiguration. There would be no point, however, in detailing these efforts although fairmess\ndemands that they should at least be mentioned.\n\nAmong those with a competing theory was the analytical chemist, Frederic Jueneman,\nwhom we have met on several occasions in the past pages of this work. Contrary to the thesis\nbeing presented here, Jueneman opted for the planet Mars as having been the immobile bo-\nreal sun of which the mytho-historical record speaks.>\n\nThere was also Earl Milton, a spectroscopist working out of the department of Physics at\nthe University of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. Having already questioned the presently ac-\ncepted tenets of astrophysics, he did not see the axial coupling of Earth with proto-Saturn as\nan insoluble problem but simply as one concerning a scheme with which he did not entirely\nagree.\u00a9 This was not to be wondered at because he, also, had been working on a model of his\nown. This was based on a scenario reconstructed by his colleague, Alfred de Grazia. Unfor-\ntunately, while de Grazia acknowledged the universality of the mytho-historical record, he\nshowed a distinct penchant for using Greek sources as the yard-stick against which to meas-\nure his cosmic scheme. Thus, de Grazia saw it as imperative to accommodate the Greek gen-\neration of gods in which each deity was considered to have been the offspring of the preced-\ning one. In following Immanuel Velikovsky, who had interpreted the birth of Athena from\nthe head of Zeus as the actual ejection of the planet Venus from the planet Jupiter, de Grazia\ndeceived himself into believing that, similarly, the ejection of one planet from another has to\nbe implied by all such divine births.? And Milton, unfortunately, followed suit. This resulted\nin a hypothesized sequence of planetary fissionings and ejections\u2014 Uranus and Saturn from\nwhat Milton and de Grazia termed super-Uranus, Jupiter from Saturn and, finally, still fol-\nlowing Velikovsky, Venus from Jupiter.\u00ae",
