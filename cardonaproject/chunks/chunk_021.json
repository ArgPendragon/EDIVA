Sediment has always been deemed a reliable indicator\nof past climatic conditions. What Briskin discovered through the age and molecular design of\nthe ocean fossils imbedded in the sediments she studied, led her to conclude that Earth\u2019s cli-\nmate follows a repetitive cycle of changes of approximately 413,000 years duration. This\ncycle, according to her, is brought about by Earth\u2019s changing orbit as it moves closer to, then\nfarther away from, the Sun.>4 As far as the present work is concerned, no judgment will be\npassed on the possible validity or otherwise of this deduction. We merely note it as one indi-\ncation of various theories from the establishment in which changes in Earth\u2019s orbit are de-\nduced from certain evidences and made to account for certain past situations.\n\nAre any of these scenarios any wilder than one which posits Earth to be an escaped satel-\nlite of Saturn? Ah yes\u2014but the above events, whether they ever transpired or not, have all\nbeen dated to millions of years ago as opposed to the scenario being presented here which\nclaims Earth to have still been a satellite of Satur during the advent of man. This is an ob-\njection we will be running into time and again.\n\nIn 1986, Lynn Rose, who, with Raymond Vaughan, had been working on the Babylonian\nNinsianna tablets, surprised Velikovsky\u2019s followers by correcting their earlier conclusion,\nand that of Velikovsky himself, concerning the not-so-ancient orbit of the planet Venus. In\n1950, Velikovsky had been of the opinion that the astronomical observations contained in\nthese tablets-~sometimes referred to as the Tablets of Ammizaduga, sometimes simply as the\nVenus tablets\u2014showed beyond a reasonable doubt that Venus had been moving on an en-\ntirely different orbit at the time the observations were conducted.>> Originally concurring\nwith him, Rose and Vaughan eventually came to an entirely different conclusion.\n\n\u201cLike many others, including Velikovsky, we at one time took it for granted that the\nVenus tablets would tell us about a radically different orbit of Venus...We have grad-\nually come to realize, however, that at the time of the observations Venus might have\nbeen on or close to its present orbit...The strangeness of these eighth-century {B.C.]\nobservations of Venus seems to be mainly due to their having been made from an\nEarth that was on a radically different orbit from the present orbit of Earth.\u201d\n\nIn 1993, Michael Reade came to similar conclusions,*\u2019 although the amount in Earth\u2019s\norbital expansion as given by him\u2014from a posited 0.9904 AU to the present 1.000\nAU\u2014would not lend itself to being called radical, representing a mere 0.97% to 1%\nexpansion.\u00b08\n\n3 T.

Maybe not, but, theoretically at least, could we not perhaps shift Saturn into\nthe habitable zone? Actually, back in 1982, Ragnar Forshufvud theorized just that, moving a\nSaturn that had once been much larger to \u201cmuch closer to the Sun\u201d.6 But [ only present this\ndatum as an interesting exercise because, judging by what can be deduced from the mytho-\nhistorical record, the truth may have been exactly the opposite.\n\nBe that as it may, it is not really necessary to move a celestial body into the so-called\nhabitable zone, or even closer to the Sun, in order to have it appropriately heated. Io, one of\nJupiter\u2019s satellites, is said to be heated through Jupiter\u2019s tidal pull. Then why not Earth as a\nsatellite of Saturn? And even then, do we really need Saturn\u2019s tidal pull in order to heat\nEarth? Have we not already seen that Saturn radiates more heat than it actually receives from\nthe Sun? Can not this excessive heat be seen as the residue from a time when Saturn was\nmuch hotter? Have we not, on the strength of the mytho-historical record, posited that Saturn\nhad once been a miniature sun radiating its own heat and light? True enough, Saturn could\nnever have been as hot as the Sun. The proximity of Earth to Saturn, however, would have\nmore than compensated for this.\n\n4 Ibid.\n65 R.

What Wescott referred to as Aster is to us the planet\nSaturn.\n\nIf this had really been the case\u2014in other words, had Saturn been the only celestial body\nvisible from Earth during the indeterminate time with which we are concerned \u2014it would add\neven more to the ancient belief that Saturn had been the most prominent heavenly body that\ncould be seen in Earth\u2019s primordial sky. Think about it: We have seen that Earth had been a\nsatellite of what is now the planet Saturn, which planet was described as having been near\nenough to Earth to be remembered as a sphere, which sphere, in turn, was described as a sun\nthat shone at night during a time when no other heavenly body could be seen.

                "content": "gods.\n\nSome have claimed that man\u2019s own ancestors, long dead, perhaps through the medium of\ndreams, were also vivified into ghosts, or lost souls, which were eventually incorporated into\nan ever evolving religious belief. Others insist that the ancient deities evolved out of a respect\nfor certain historical persons of note\u2014an old idea which has recently. been gloriously revived\nby David Rohl in his sensational attempt to rewrite ancient history. Those who hold to this\nview usually point with pride to the Mesopotamian Gilgamesh, a supposed king of Uruk, and\nthe Egyptian Imhotep, architect to King Djoser, as prime examples of their evidence. But that\nGilgamesh was anything but a historical person has finally been established beyond a reason-\nable doubt, once and for all, by Ev Cochrane,\u00ae while the case of Imhotep is somewhat\nunique. The first builder of a pyramid\u2014a stepped one to be sure\u2014later dynasts were so im-\npressed by Imhotep\u2019s accomplishments that he was elevated to the stature of a god. This is\nnot to be wondered at because, after all, the Egyptian pharaohs themselves were all looked\nupon as living gods. We do not, however, encounter Imhotep in any mythological themes, let\nalone any of a cosmogonic nature. For whatever it is worth, and Rohl notwithstanding, the\nbelief that the ancient gods were really deified historical persons, never adhered to by many,\nis now accepted by even less. On the contrary, the reverse is true, in that some of the\nprimeval deities were eventually demythologized and presented in human garb even by the\nancients themselves.\u201d\n\nOur own hypothesis, as presented in this work, holds to the view that the concept of deity\nowes its origin to the planets, especially the planet Saturn, and not to such invented spirits,\nghosts, demons, or historical persons as described above. I am not here asserting that the\nmysteries of everyday life, as they pertained to our primitive forebears, were not conducive\nof the myth-making process. But to say that our ancestors were more concerned with the\nthreatening character of everyday life, such as flood, famine, earthquakes, and the like, is to\ngo against what they themselves told us concerning their beliefs. If the truth need be known,\neven such calamities as enumerated above were often connected with the planetary deities,\nand they were so connected by the ancients themselves. Thus, to give but a few examples:\nAmong the Incas, Saturn was considered the god of famine.* Almost throughout the entire\nworld, Mars was considered the god of pestilence.\u201d Venus was associated with fear, dark-\nness and death.\u201d The Babylonians, moreover, never discarded their belief that even earth-\nquakes were actually caused by the planets. 3\n\nAdherents of the animistic theory, however, base their concepts of the origin of religion\non the beliefs of present primitive peoples, rather than the civilized nations of the ancient\nworld. But even there, their theory meets with various objections. Consider, for instance, the\nEfe pygmies of the Ituri forest whom we had occasion to mention in a previous chapter.\nThese pygmies do not cower in fear of thunder and lightning. Their lives are not ruled, or ter-\nrorized, by a squadron of jungle spirits that have to be appeased every time a calamity hits\n\n\u201cSD. Rohl, Legend:, in toto.\n\n4 E.
