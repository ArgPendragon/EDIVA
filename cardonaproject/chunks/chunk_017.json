                "content": "As befitted his nocturnal station, Osiris was venerated in a festival which took place at\nnight.\n\n\u201cHerodotus tells us that the grave of Osiris was at Sais in Lower Egypt, and that there\nwas a lake there upon which the sufferings of the god were displayed as a mystery by\nnight. This commemoration of the divine passion was held once a year...and an im-\nage of a cow, made of gilt with a golden sun between its horns, was carried out of the\nchamber in which it stood the rest of the year...A great feature of the festival was the\nnocturnal illumination. People fastened rows of oil-lamps to the outside of their\nhouses, and the lamps bummed all night long. The custom was not confined to Sais, but\nwas observed throughout the whole of Egypt.\u201d\u00ae\n\nAnother celebration connected with Osiris was the Sed festival which has been claimed to\nbe the oldest Egyptian feast of which we yet retain a trace.\u201d James Frazer has suggested that\nthe ritual, which is known to have been celebrated until the end of the Roman period, was as\nold as Egypt itself. This particular event was held every thirty years\u2014which makes it signifi-\ncant since thirty years is the period of Saturn\u2019s revolution around the Sun. As Frazer himself\nstates, this correlation of the Sed festival with the planet\u2019s revolution has been noticed, and\ncommented upon, by several scholars before him. Since then, the subject has been ap-\nproached again by de Santillana and von Dechend, although here the authors present Ptah,\nrather than Osiris, as the \u201cinventor\u201d of the festival, even though they themselves identify Ptah\nas \u201cthe Egyptian Saturn.\u201d* The Sed, of course, was a royal jubilee festival which the pharaoh\nheld after having reigned thirty years. Lucky was the pharaoh who could celebrate two such\njubilees.\n\nNor was this custom unique to Egypt. The Persian Shahs, who traced their lineage from\nthe towering figures of the mythical kings\u2014Kai Kubad, Kai Ka\u2019us, and Kai Khusrau\u2014also\ncelebrated their royal jubilee after having reigned thirty years\u2014a fact that did not escape the\nattention of de Santillana and von Dechend.*\n\nMeanwhile, a curious tale comes our way through Apuleius who tells us that, when being\ninitiated into the mysteries of Isis, wife of Osiris, a certain Lucius was given \u201cto see the sun\n\nSee here, J.

                "content": "to the degree of Osiris himself, during which initiation he spends ten days in fasting before\nhe is introduced to the nocturnal rites, or orgia, of Osiris.\n\nAnother nocturnal feast, as brought to my attention by Roger Ashton, is also held in some\nparts of India when the thirteenth day of a lunar fortnight happens to fall on a Saturday. In\nSanskrit, the day of Saturday is called Shanivar which, Shani being Saturn, translates as\n\u201cSaturn\u2019s Day.\u201d Actually, Saturday was the day held sacred to Saturn among more than one\nancient nation and, to this day, it continues to bear the planet\u2019s name not only in Sanskrit. To\n, which word is sometimes said to derive from\nthe closely related shabath, which means \u201cto repose\u201d or \u201cto rest.\u201d In fact, however, the\nSabbath is named in honor of Satur which, in Hebrew, is called Shabtai.\u201d The word sha-\nbath\u2014\"to repose\u201d \u2014is then traceable to the same root, derived because Elohim was said to\nhave rested from creation on that day.* In Italian, Saturday is rendered Sabato, derived from\nHebrew through the Greek Sabbaton. In Maltese, Saturday is called Sibt, derived from the\nsame Semitic root. The English name Saturday is itself a contraction of the Saxon Saterne\u2019s\n from the Latin Saturni Dies. Even in Indo-China, and more specifically Cam-\nbodia, Saturday is named in honor of Prah Sau, which is the planet Satu.\u201d\n\nNow while it is true that not every ceremony that is celebrated on a Saturday has to be\nSaturnian in character and/or origin, the Indian ceremony mentioned above is itself called\nShani Pradosh.\u00ae Since pradosh means \u201cnight,\u201d the festival in question is translatable as\n\u201cSaturn\u2019s Night.\u201d A ceremony called Satum\u2019s Night held in the evening of Saturn\u2019s Day is\nnot just any ceremony conducted on a Saturday; it is obviously one conducted in honor of\nSaturn.\n\nThus it was that, among other things, Saturn became known as the Lord of the Sabbath,\u201d\na belief which finds a curious echo in Persian cosmogony. As Al-Biruni, an Arabian scholar\nof the 11th century A.D., tells us:\n\n\u201cOn the 6th day of Farwardin, the day Khurdadh, is the great Nauroz, for the Persians\na feast of great importance. On this day\u2014they say\u2014God finished the creation, for it\nis the last of the six days...On this day God created Saturn. ..\u201d*\n\nThe pre-Islamic feast of Nauroz\u2014or Naw Ruz, as it is sometimes transliterated\u2014continues\nto be celebrated unto this day on the eve of the Persian New Year which traditionally takes\nplace on the first day of spring. It continues to be celebrated not only in Iran (i.e. ancient Per-\nsia)\n\n2s Apuleius, Metamorphoses , 1X:22, X1:23.\n\n*R_E, Witt, Isis in the Graeco-, p. 159.\n\n55 Hindi-English edition of Bhargava\u2019s Standard Illustrated Dictionary of the Hindi Language (Varanasi,\n1960), p.

Exactly a year later, Pioneer 11 skimmed within\n27,000 miles of the planet\u2019s south polar region. The new data that these two space probes re-\nlayed to Earth sent astronomers and astrophysicists scurrying back to their slide rules and\ncalculations. Observations in the infrared had already indicated that Jupiter was much\nbrighter than would be the case had it merely been a planet reflecting light. D. A. Allen noted\nthat, at 5 mu, Jupiter appeared so bright that it must be radiating more energy than it could\nabsorb from the Sun.!! \u201cWhen the long wavelength data are also included,\u201d wrote Allen, \u201cwe\nfind that Jupiter radiates nearly three times the energy it receives.\u201d !\n\nAs if he had been the only one or the first, D. McNally, who was then with the University\nof London Observatory, suggested the idea that Jupiter may be more like a star than a\nplanet.!3 John A. Simpson, then professor of physics at the University of Chicago, described\nJupiter as \u201cnature\u2019s best gift of what a poor man\u2019s star is like.\u201d!4\n\nWhat the data from the Pioneer probes had disclosed was that Jupiter is a fast rotating\nmass of liquid hydrogen. Its convective weather seems to be driven by what physicists began\nto call its \u201cprimordial internal heat.\u201d As time went by, more astronomers began to talk about\nJupiter\u2019s \u201cstarlike properties\u201d and its similarities to a \u201cmini-solar system.\u201d 15\n\n\u201cBut Jupiter is definitely not a star,\u201d Henry Simmons stated and added that, although the\nplanet\u2019s core may reach as much as 30,000\u00b0C, its temperature is \u201chundreds of times too low\nto ignite the thermonuclear reactions that heat the stars.\u201d!\u00a9 These giant planets, Arielle Em-\nmet echoed him, \u201ccould not heat up enough to begin deuterium burning.\u201d !7\n\nFirsoff did not quite agree. He stated that even the lowest assumed temperature of\nJupiter\u2019s interior is adequate to initiate nuclear fusion. With deuterium, which has been dis-\ncovered in the Jovian atmosphere, a reaction can start at 50,000\u00b0K. Lithium and beryllium\nburning would soon follow. \u201cThis could raise the central temperature to 1,000,000\u00b0C, re-\nquired for the proton-proton reaction, which is the main source of power in the Sun.\u201d 8\n\n:, pp. 89-90.\nIbid.\n10], Velikovsky, \u201cA Rejoinder to Motz,\u201d, p. 14.",

                "content": "By late 1980, Voyager 1 did for Saturn what the earlier Pioneers had done for Jupiter.\nGarry Hunt, the Voyager mission meteorologist, stated: \u201cWe have this paradox of bodies that\nare somewhat like stars inside but have Earth-like weather on the outside.\u201d\n\nIt did not, of course, require Voyager 1, or the later Voyager 2, to bring this conclusion\nhome. Writing in 1976, Simmons had already spoken for the scientific community at large\nwhen he stated that, like Jupiter, Saturn appears to emit more heat than it receives from the\nSun.\n\n\u201cBeing further out [wrote Rick Gore], Saturn gets only a fourth the solar energy that\nJupiter receives. At Jupiter the solar heat striking the atmosphere is equal to the inter-\nnal heat coming up. At more distant Saturn internal heating dominates. The up-\nwelling of this heat may generate the much stronger surface winds. In any event, both\nplanets are a theorist\u2019s delight.\u201d\n\nIn fact, scientists found that Saturn generates bursts of energy in the one-megahertz fre-\nquency range.\n\nGore described Saturn as \u201ca pale yellow giant, a turbulent ball of primordial gas that more\nresembles a star than the inner planets we know.\u201d24 Emmet had earlier expressed similar\nviews. \u201cRecent observations of the giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn,\u201d he wrote, \u201clend cre-\ndence to earlier speculation that both were actually proto-stars.\u201d Both have a system of ac-\ncompanying satellites which have been likened to miniature solar systems.?5\n\nSaturn\u2019s temperature was eventually given as 94.4 + 3\u00b0 K. But this, it must be pointed\nout, was not the assumed temperature of the planet\u2019s interior. Its total heat emission has been\ncalculated at about 2.2 times higher than its absorbed sunlight. It was then felt that this excess\nheat cannot be due to residue from the planet\u2019s formative period. An internal heat source,\nlong postulated, was therefore thought to be certain.?6\n\nIn 1977 Firsoff had written that \u201cit has been obvious for many years that Saturn is heated\nfrom within.\u201d According to him, Saturn must be powered by substantially the same nuclear\nprocesses he had postulated for Jupiter.?\u201d",
