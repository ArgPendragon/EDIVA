If an\nexplosion such as one of these had occurred within 100 light years of the Earth, it is\nlikely that it would have caused severe damage to animal and plant life, both directly\nbecause of the radiation effects, and also as a result of associated destruction of the\nozone layer.”!\nThis is not Palmer’s own pet theory. And neither is it new. Michael Lemonick had\nalready earlier reported that: “Although many scientists now lean toward the theory that\ndinosaurs were wiped out 65 million years ago by the impact on earth of a large comet or\nasteroid, some experts until recently were suggesting that radiation from a nearby supernova\nmight have been the culprit.”? As he then goes on:\n“...if one should go off within ten to 20 light-years away, says Radio Astronomer\nGerrit Verschuur, ‘we would have a problem. Everything would be destroyed by\nblasts of X rays, ultraviolet radiation and cosmic rays.’ Radiation from an expanding\nsupernova even as distant as 50 light-years, he says, would pack a tremendous\nwallop, probably destroying the atmosphere’s protective ozone layer and causing\nharmful mutations. Such a supernova could alter the course of biological evolution,\nperhaps wiping out entire species.”\nHowever, and despite all that, as Lemonick notes: “No evidence exists that a supernova\nhas ever flared close enough to earth to destroy life.”* But, while not exactly a supernova,\nproto-Saturn’s flare-up would have been close enough to produce similar effects. Thus, for\none thing, the blasts from supernovae are believed to form great clouds of gas and dust. So,\nalso, must have the blast from proto-Saturn’s explosive flare-up. And, to be sure, our strato-\nsphere is still impregnated by interplanetary dust particles the nuclear tracks of which have\nbeen identified in collected specimens. The presence of these tracks “unambiguously\nconfirms the extraterrestrial nature” of these particles and the high track densities have\nsuggested “an exposure age of approximately 10* years within the inner solar system.”6 10*\nyears, as the educated reader knows, translates into 10,000 years, smack on our bench-mark\nfigure.\nDIAMONDS\nAtmospheric dust would also have been supplemented by the additional fall of meteorites\nsince there is no doubt that Earth would have been besieged by a fair amount of cosmic\ndebris during the period under discussion. And, to be sure, terrestrial meteorites said to have\noriginated from supernovae have been suggested by the chemist Edward Anders and the\nphysicist Roy Lewis who, at the time, both hailed from the University of Chicago.

Anders and Lewis confirmed this conclusion\nwhen they discovered an abundance of submicroscopic diamonds in a meteorite which had\nlanded in Mexico in 1969. Now while it is accepted that the impact of a meteor creates\nenough pressure to crystallize carbon into diamonds, this was discarded in view of the fact\nthat the submicroscopic diamonds in question contained atomic forms of the gas xenon\nwhich was entirely different from the kind found on Earth\n“The diamonds, Anders suggests, came from red supergiant stars that threw off their\nouter coats, forming a gas shell. As the star’s shell expanded outward and cooled, the\ncarbon in it condensed and crystallized, forming diamonds. Later, when the star ex-\nploded, it created xenon that shot from the star’s outer layers and caught up with the\ndiamonds.”3\nThese diamond-bearing meteorites would then have traveled through interstellar space\nuntil, in our year 1969, one of them was swept up by our orbiting Earth. Actually, submicro-\nscopic-diamond-bearing meteorites had been known from before that and, in fact, Anders\nhimself had originally been of the belief that they would have been most likely formed\nthrough shock effects.4 That diamonds can also grow metastably at low pressure from gase-\nous phases was shown in 1968 by J.C. Angus.5\nAnother diamond-bearing meteorite was discovered in Antarctica in 1977. This one,\nhowever, spurred a different theory. Mineralogists at the National Museum of Natural\nHistory were of the opinion that the diamonds were formed when two asteroids collided in\ndeep space, thus reverting to the impact shock theory of previous years. The meteorite in this\ncase would then have been a fragment from the original asteroidal collision.®\nObviously in ignorance of previous diamond-bearing meteorites, the editors of GEO mis-\ninform their readers by telling them that the “only other iron meteorite known to contain dia-\nmonds” is the massive Canyon Diablo meteorite which “blasted a one-mile-wide crater in\nwhat is now Arizona when it fell to earth about 50,000 years ago.” It was, according to this\nreport, the force of the impact which “converted the meteorite’s carbon content to\ndiamonds.” However, as the same report notes, the Antarctic diamond-bearing meteorite did\nnot form a crater when it landed and it must therefore have contained the diamonds before it\nlanded—which is what led the above mentioned mineralogists to favor the asteroid collision\ntheory.” But one is then inclined to ask: If the Canyon Diablo meteorite created its diamond\ncontent through the shock of its impact in Arizona, should there not be some diamond traces",

Thus, for instance, literally millions of micro-diamonds have been hy-\npothesized to have been formed from condensing plumes of vaporized carbonaceous material\nwhen the massive meteorite that created the 24-kilometer-wide Reis crater impacted suppos-\nedly 15 million years ago.! Why not similarly with the Canyon Diablo meteorite?\n\nFor a while during the 1980s cosmic diamond mania seemed to grip the astronomical\nworld. Basing his hypothesis on his own work as well as that of Francis Ree and William\nNellis, Marvin Ross, then at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, managed to\ncreate, even if but for a brief period, temperatures and pressures exceeding those necessary\nfor creating diamonds, while performing shock-wave experiments on methane. From this he\nthen predicted that the ultradense layers of methane believed to exist thousands of miles deep\nwithin the planets Uranus and Neptune would have long created diamonds in their interiors.”\nIn the case of Neptune, they might even be raining down. As Robin Benedetti claimed,\nalthough they cannot be sure how big these Neptunian diamond crystals might form, it is\n“possible that diamonds are literally raining down through the atmosphere [of Neptune]\ntoward the planet’s center, releasing heat as a result of friction.”3\n\nOther researchers, jumping on the same band wagon, speculated that Uranus and Neptune\nwould not be the only bodies in which diamonds would have been formed in abundance. The\nring around Uranus itself, it has been suggested, may also be composed of diamond dust. Ti-\ntan, one of the satellites of Saturn, was named as another possible candidate since it, too, is\nbelieved to contain something like five percent methane in its atmosphere*\n\nA large number of tiny diamonds were also discovered by the then Soviet scientist E.\nSobotovich strewn throughout the site over which the Tunguska bolide exploded. This led\nCarl Sagan to the hypothesis that diamonds might also be the constituents of comets.>\n\nThe subject of cometary diamonds received an additional boost when Davis Brez Carlisle\nand Dennis Braman came across micro-specimens in the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary clay\nof Alberta, Canada. As Trevor Palmer tells it, these diamonds were similar to ones found in\nchondritic meteorites, the most primitive meteorites known which consist of a fine-grained\nmatrix in which coarse-grained particles are embedded. But, although they could have been\nproduced through impact-shock from terrestrial rocks, “further investigation excluded that\npossibility and confirmed that the diamonds were extraterrestrial in origin.” As he adds,\n“moreover, the indications were that the bolide was a comet rather than an asteroid.”6\n\nOur interest here centers on the fact that diamonds have turned up in the Ice Age drift de-\nposits in Russia, Poland, Germany, and France, not to mention other countries in Europe and\nthe Near East, as also in Sudbury, Ontario, and as far south as Ohio. The occurrence of these\ndiamonds in non-metamorphosed sediments indicates that they could not have been produced\nby pressure and temperature in situ.

It was initially suggested that glacial action during the so-\ncalled Ice Age transported the diamonds thither from Labrador, a region which later\nstudies showed was actually never seriously glaciated. These diamonds...must\ntherefore have been dispersed by other means.”\n\nMeanwhile, Anders has further suggested that if shock waves from an ancient supernova\nsparked the creation of our Sun and present planets, “it’s very likely that the material from\nwhich our solar system was formed was contaminated with these diamonds.” And: “The dia-\nmonds on earth,” he goes on, “may well be a mixture of those loaded with xenon and those\nwithout it.”3 As reported elsewhere, one recent supernova, SN1987A, “may have the right\nconditions for the formation of microscopic diamonds.” This theory was fed a certain\namount of reliability through the nature of those peculiar black diamonds known as carbona-\ndos, the source and formation of which have long puzzled geologists. Known to be geologi-\ncally old, the mystery of their formation is now thought to be solved through the suggestion\nthat they accrued through the shock waves of just such exploding stars and falling to Earth in\nmeteors as far back as Precambrian times.>\n\nIf micro-diamonds can be formed in this manner, it gives us reason to assume that proto-\nSaturn’s flare-up would also have produced them. After all, it is easier to believe that micro-\ndiamonds could have showered Earth from proto-Saturn’s close proximity than from the as-\ntronomical reaches of galactic supernovae. But even if not—given that proto-Saturn’s flare-\nup was less than feather-weight in status when compared to supernovae—there is more.\n\nThrough the utilization of the Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble space telescope plus\narchival data from the International Ultraviolet Explorer satellite, Geoffrey Clayton and his\nresearch team detected a carbon crystalline substance in the dust clouds enshrouding new-\nborn stars. Suspecting that this crystalline substance might be diamonds, they compared its\nultraviolet signature to that of diamond-bearing meteorites. “The spectral data between the\ntwo samples was such a tight match,” reports Paul Morledge, “that Clayton and his colleagues\nare confident that they have locked on to interstellar diamonds.” Needless to say, these\ndiamond grains are now believed to have been formed through the searing heat and extreme\npressures produced by bygone supernovae. And, again, it has been suggested that space debris\nmust have swept up some of this diamond dust as our Solar System was forming. More",

They might possibly account for five percent of the carbonaceous\nmolecules lurking in interstellar space. Based on this discovery, Clayton estimates\nthat the Milky Way may contain many trillions of tons of diamonds.”\nIf that is the case, there would be reason to believe that Earth, in the company of proto-\nSaturn, would have picked up its share of these cosmic diamonds as the proto-Saturnian sys-\ntem traveled through the reaches of space on the way to its historic rendezvous with our pre-\nsent Sun.\nEarth, however, would also have produced its own diamonds. In fact, let us be fair about\nall this: Most terrestrial diamonds are recovered from a rock matrix that forms mostly in so-\ncalled diamond pipes, which are funnels, more or less oval in section, that narrow with in-\ncreasing depth. Although diamonds have been mined from more than 4,000 feet below\nground, the pipes continue to reach downwards to unknown depths. There is therefore not\nmuch doubt that diamonds form in the depths of our planet under great heat and pressure.\nThose found in alluvial deposits would have either been released through erosion from the\ntops of such pipes or spewed up by volcanic eruptions. Given the extensive volcanic activity\nthat accompanied, and aided in, the melting of the Pleistocene glaciers, there would have been\na fair amount of micro-diamonds, if not even sizeable ones, ejected into the atmosphere at the\nend of the Ice Age. These would then have precipitated back down to the surface. Thus the\nmicro-diamonds found embedded in Pleistocene glacial drift could have come from one or\nanother of the above-discussed sources and, perhaps, even from a combination of two or more\nof them. As explained, these sources would have been: (1) interstellar diamond dust; (2) vol-\ncanic spewing; and (3) perhaps even through the metamorphic processes of proto-Saturn’s\nflare-up itself. The micro-diamonds would have landed on both the ice and the much more\nporous drift. The ice, as we know, melted, taking the micro-diamonds with it to the sea. The\nmicro-diamonds in the drift remained behind. It is even possible that some of the micro-dia-\nmond-bearing meteorites would have fallen to Earth at the end of the Pleistocene, bringing\nwith them not only diamonds, but also a fair share of iridium.\nThe above then leads us to ask: If diamonds did rain down from the sky at the end of the\nPleistocene Ice Age, would man have been aware of it? Is there anything in the mytho-histori-\ncal record that mentions diamonds falling from the sky? If we are talking of micro-diamonds,\nthat is diamond dust, there is no way in which man would have noticed such precipitation. But\nif we mean sizeable chunks, both individually or in meteorites, he might have. Even so, to be\nquite honest, Ihave not been able to exhume any such reports from the mytho-historical re-",

Fair enough, so were other gems whether or not believed to have fallen from\nthe sky. But the diamond was also associated with snakes and referred to as a snake-stone to-\ngether with the carbuncle, the borax, the bezoar, and similar other stones. This came about\nthrough the traditional belief that such stones were once retrieved from the heads of snakes.\nFair enough, there have been rare instances were “hard and stony excrescences have actually\nbeen found on some snakes.” But, as Mircea Eliade notes:\n“Tn fact it is only in very rare cases that a ‘snake-stone’ is actually a stone taken from\nthe head of a snake; the enormous majority of magic and medicinal stones, whether\nor not they have any reptilian nickname, are connected with snakes in some way\nsimply because of the original myth which can...be reduced to a metaphysical\n9993\ntheme: ‘a monster guarding the emblems of immortality’.”3\ntheme: ‘a monster guarding the emblems of immortality’.\nAgain, I hate to jump ahead chronologically, but, as I will indicate in a future volume,\nwhen the axis mundi, which we have seen being retracted, reconstituted itself not long after\nproto-Saturn’s flare-up, it was inter alia visualized as an upright snake holding the Saturnian\norb in its gaping jaws. It was in this manner that the cosmic snake or dragon was said to have\nguarded the jewel of the sky which Eliade has interpreted as an emblem of immortality. So,\nalso, it was believed that one of the eyes of the “undying serpent” was actually a diamond.* A\ncurious passage in Plato’s Republic goes as far as stating that the axis mundi, described there\nas “the spindle of Necessity,” was made of “adamant,”> from which the word “diamond” is\nultimately derived. Once proto-Saturn and/or its axis was visualized as a radiant jewel,\nterrestrial gem stones were regarded as its emissions. Thus, as Eliade tells us: “In many\nplaces, precious stones were thought to be fallen from the heads of snakes or dragons.”¢\nFair enough, in itself, none of the above beliefs constitute evidence of diamonds falling\nfrom the sky. But now consider: In Sanskrit, the word for “diamond” is vajra, which also\nmeans lightning.” One can say what one wishes, but there is nothing in a diamond, especially\nin the rough as it would have been discovered by prehistoric peoples, that would even\nsymbolically connect it with lightning. I will not be adamant about it, but could it not perhaps\nbe that the fall of diamonds was accompanied by volcanic, atmospheric, or even cosmic\nlightning? Thus, for instance, we come across the ancient belief that thunderbolts actually\ncontain a diamond inside them.’",

But from where would\nEarth have collected this debris?\nThere was a time not so long ago when the Solar System planets were numbered as nine.\nBut then, in the early 1990s, Alan Stern came along with the proposition that that figure\nmight be off by several hundred! —perhaps even by as much as thousands.” According to\nStern, enormous numbers of icy bodies may be orbiting beyond the orbit of Pluto. “There are\na number of smoking guns in the Solar System,” he claimed, “that point to a previously\nunsuspected population of Pluto-like objects.” Among these smoking guns Stern pointed to\nNeptune’s moon Triton which orbits in the wrong direction and is explained by him as\nhaving once been a free-ranging body that passed too close to Neptune and was captured by\nits gravity. There is also the case of Chiron, discovered in an unstable orbit between Saturn\nand Uranus in 1977. Undecided whether Chiron was a very small planet or a very large\ncomet, calculations of its odd orbit condemns it to eventual gravitational ejection from its\npresent path. Thus Stern believes that Chiron, too, had originated as a body much farther out\nin the Solar System and that it was pulled in by the giant outer planets. Pluto itself has a\nmoon, now named Charon, which was discovered in 1978. Nearly as big as Pluto itself,\nCharon (not to be confused with Chiron), forms with Pluto a double planet. Stern believes\nthat these two planets had once orbited in individual paths before they approached and\ncaptured each other. This is bolstered by the fact that Pluto-Charon follow the most eccentric\nplanetary orbit in the entire Solar System.3\nAs Stern reasoned, given the vast spatial volume covered by the Solar System, the\nchances of these few theorized encounters would be about one in ten billion. As Sam\nFlamsteed phrased it: “An obvious way to improve the odds is to increase the original\npopulation of the solar system from a handful of objects to hundreds—or perhaps a few\nthousand—swarming among the known planets.”+\n“The gravitational fields of the outer planets would have swept some of the objects\nup and flung the rest out into space in slingshot fashion. The only reason Pluto,\nCharon, and Triton [to say nothing of Chiron] were left is that they stabilized\ngravitationally.”5\nThe evicted bodies, according to Stern, should still be orbiting the Sun at anything from\n10 to 1,000 times the distance of Pluto.®\nBut was all this merely theory? Not the way things turned out.",

By the year 2001, more than 300 objects\nwere discovered in an outer region dubbed the Kuiper Belt—named after Gerard Kuiper who\nmore or less predicted its existence in 1951—some 55 astronomical units from the Sun.? In\nthe following years, this number rose. Pluto, the farthest planet from the Sun, ranges between\n30 and 50 astronomical units. The question that astronomers found themselves asking was\nwhether the Solar System’s extent ended at that limit. Fair enough, planetary scientists knew\nwell enough that the Sun’s limit of gravitational and magnetic influence lay beyond that limit\nwhile countless comets orbiting much farther beyond Pluto’s orbit had long been theorized.\nThose comets are believed to be there because they, too, were ejected from the inner Solar\nSystem. What Lynne Allen, Gary Bernstein, and Renu Malhotta were looking for when they\nset out to find the edge of the Solar System was whether other bodies could have formed\nbeyond that limit. Twenty four new objects were discovered by this team, nine of which were\none hundred miles in diameter or even bigger. But while none of them lay much beyond\nPluto’s orbit, that was soon to change.\n\nAmong the Kuiper Belt Objects—now termed KBOs—a giant ball of ice and rock with a\ndiameter of about 800 miles was discovered in June of 2002. Dubbed Quaoar—pronounced\n“Kwah-o-wahr”— after the god of Creation believed in by the Tongva Indians that once in-\nhabited the Los Angeles area+—it lies at a distance of 4 billion miles from Earth, more than a\nbillion miles beyond Pluto. Also new to the Solar System’s family, with diameters ranging in\nthe region of 560 miles, are an object named Varuna and one ignominiously numbered 2002\nAW 197. While the compiling of the present work was in progress, the number of KBOs rose\nfrom 300 to more than 500,° and it will have risen much more by the time it sees the light of\nday.\n\nPersonally, I take no stand concerning the theories proposed re the origin of these objects.\nAll Tam concerned with for the moment is the fact of their existence at the edge of the Solar\nSystem beyond the orbit of Pluto.\n\nReturning now to our thesis, we have already noted that once the proto-Saturnian system\nentered the Sun’s domain of influence, the chances of its encountering any of the major plan-\nets the Sun might already have held in its gravitational embrace would have been minimal.\nOn the other hand, the chances of encountering some of the much more numerous even if\nless massive objects in the Kuiper Belt at the edge of the Solar System would have been\nmuch higher and very much probable. Keep in mind that the proto-Saturnian system was\ntraveling poleward with proto-Saturn leading, approaching the Solar System from “below,”\nat an angle somewhere in the vicinity of 23 or 26 degrees. As we have also indicated, the\nproto-Saturnian system did not approach the Solar System in an undeviating direction but",

As it\ncontinued to spiral in, it would eventually have moved out of the Kuiper Belt, but, in the\ninterim—and it is difficult to calculate for how long—the proto-Saturnian system would have\nbecome a temporary, but honorable, member of the Kuiper Belt club. It is therefore very\nlikely that a few of the Kuiper Belt Objects would have come into near-contact with the\nproto-Saturnian system. Because of proto-Saturn’s higher mass, some of the large Kuiper\nBelt bodies would have been captured into orbit around the gas giant—and of these we will\nhave much to say in the next volume of this series. Smaller chunks, however, would have\nimpacted proto-Saturn as well as Earth. Those that fell onto proto-Saturn would have\nprobably been vaporized out of existence. Some of those that fell on earth would have been\npreserved. That the fall of meteorites was observed by early man is a well-accepted tenet of\nancient history as well as the history of astronomy. John Lewis placed the entire subject in\nthe proverbial nutshell when he wrote that:\n\n“Long before modern times, long before there was such a thing as a university or a\nscientist, long before the invention of the alphabets and the rise of literacy, our\nremote ancestors observed brilliant fireballs in the sky, heard powerful sonic booms,\nand saw occasional meteorites fall to the ground...[A]ncient Chinese records attest\nto observed meteorite falls in terse, unembellished prose. Egyptian and Greek\nrecords from the dawn of recorded history recount stories of fireballs and meteorite\nfalls. Some illiterate peoples clearly believed that meteorites were celestial objects\n(or beings) that fell from heaven, as we deduce from the documented Amerind\npractice of burying meteorites ceremonially, attended by beads and wrapped in\nblankets, in stone-lined graves. In many cultures, iron meteorites were assiduously\nsought for use by blacksmiths to make ceremonial objects and weapons. In some\ncultures, stony meteorites were venerated, or even, as in China until the twentieth\ncentury, ground up and eaten.”!\n\nGoing out on the proverbial limb, Lewis was in fact bold enough to claim that: “Even\nwithin the short history of Homo sapiens, the most violent events on Earth have been\nextraterrestrial impacts.”? In fact he is of the belief—mistaken in our opinion— that: “Over\ntime scales of one hundred thousand years and longer, the greatest tsunami waves produced\non Earth must be from cosmic impacts.”3 We have already, in our previous volume, docu-\nmented adequate evidence concerning the fall of meteorites in ancient times and how these\nwere, as one still is, venerated as sacred images from the sky. It is not here claimed that all\nof these venerated meteorites fell at the end of the Ice Age, although some of them might",

Nor is it claimed that all meteorites originated in the Kuiper Belt, although it\nis more than possible that a few of them would have been dislodged by the passage of the\nproto-Saturnian system and catapulted into the inner Solar System. But any fall of meteorites\nduring the thawing of the glaciers would probably have been blamed by our ancient ancestors\non proto-Saturn’s flare-up. Thus we note that, in west Africa, there are “traditions which hold\nmeteors and meteorites to be a kind of solar excrement.”! The probability, here, is that the\nbelief originally pertained to the proto-Saturnian sun in lieu of our present one. This is lent\ncredibility by the additional belief that meteorites are “the heralds of Mbomvei, the supreme\nbeing.”?\n\nIn view of the fact that some meteorites are now believed to originate from superno-\nvae, and despite the fact that proto-Saturn’s flare-up was less than lightweight in comparison,\nwe should at least additionally consider the possibility that some meteorites were actually\nejected directly from proto-Saturn. Tom Van Flandern has proposed “the formation of\ncomets, meteorites, asteroids and tektites from the explosion of a larger former planet in the\nSolar System by some unknown mechanism.”? As reported by Wallace Thornhill, Van\nFlandern shows that “many anomalies in the characteristics of our solar system may be\nsimply explained by such an event.”4 While, as noted earlier, we do not subscribe to Van\nFlandern’s particular theory, our mytho-historically based scenario can still be used to\nvalidate most of his claims. In place of his exploding planet, we simply substitute proto-\nSaturn’s flare-up. The possibility also exists that proto-Saturn’s circumstellar disk might have\nalready contained some sizeable chunks of debris from some previous catastrophic event. If\nso, most of these would have been released to fall back on proto-Saturn and/or Earth once the\ndisk was blown away when proto-Saturn flared up. If that transpired, it is also possible that\nsome of these objects would have been left behind once the disk dissipated. Mainstream\nastronomy has already toyed with the idea that the Kuiper Belt objects are “the stuff that was\nleft over at the rim of the solar system after the planets formed—tailings from one of nature’s\nconstruction projects.”> Could they not instead be tailings from one of nature’s destructive\nepisdoes?\n\nALTERNATIVE POSSIBILITIES\n\nWhile man already trod on Earth when the proto-Saturnian system invaded the Sun’s do-\nmain, no one was out in space to see exactly what was transpiring. Man himself, even while\nengaged in trying to save himself from the ensuing series of calamities, could only later re-\nmember what he saw with his own eyes from the disadvantage of his terrestrial location.\nStones fell from the sky, but, beyond that, he had no way of knowing that his world was now\ntraversing through a belt laden with debris. Because proto-Saturn’s flare-up was the most sig-\nnificant occurrence up in the sky, man blamed everything else that happened on what he was",
