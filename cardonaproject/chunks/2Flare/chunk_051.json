As Richard Alley, then of the Pennsylvania State University, pro-\nclaimed: “That amount of heating, coming so quickly, is astounding.”?\nUntil recently, Earth’s past global warming was blamed on increased levels of carbon di-\noxide. Recent research, however, indicates that variations in cosmic ray activity and magnet-\nized plasma are more important in raising world-wide temperatures. Of course, these\nenergetic particles are believed to have emanated from the Sun.3 Needless to say, in our own\nscenario they would have been shed by proto-Saturn during its momentous flare-up.\nWe could go on enumerating sources which speak of the sudden build-up of heat at the\nend of the Pleistocene Ice Age, but this is a subject which finds no dissenters in orthodoxy.\nJohn Lewis put it all in a nutshell when he wrote:\n“Climatological studies of the last 2 million years from Antarctic to Greenland ice-\ncore records show that the global climate has been very unstable for that entire period\nof time, spanning several advances and retreats of the ice sheets and several relatively\nbenign interglacial periods. The most astonishing feature of the entire record is that\nthe last 6,000-10,000 years have provided by far the most stable and warm conditions\nin those 2 million years. These few thousand years of exceptionally benign and stable\nclimate coincide with the period of explosive development of human civilization.\nFrom the birth of agriculture, the founding of the first cities and the origin of writing,\nthrough the establishment of the major religions, the birth and growth of science,\ntechnology, and industrialization, to the space age...all this has happened in our nar-\nrow window of time. There has not been a single other time since the appearance of\nthe earliest hominids that Earth’s climate has been so conducive to civilization. We\nowe all human culture to a freak interval of climate stability which we think of as\n‘normal.’ We do not know why the last 2 million years were so unstable, or why the\nlast few millennia have been so stable. We do know that civilization depends on cli-\nmate stability. When—and how—will this fool’s paradise end?”\nFrom a chronological perspective, the point we have reached in our own scenario is still\nfar from the advent of agriculture, to say nothing of civilization, the birth of writing, and all\nthat these human novelties entailed. For the present, we will simply hold on to the end of the\nPleistocene Ice Age and the balmy weather which followed, if not immediately, at least soon\nafter. This new climatic regime that proto-Saturn’s flare-up ushered in was in later times nos-\ntalgically remembered, among other things, as Heaven on Earth. But of that, more in a future\nvolume.",

As we have often stated, the Universe is\nnow generally accepted to be 99% composed of plasma which conducts electricity and\ngenerates magnetic fields in all of space. Our reliance on these forces, and the phenomena\nthey lead to, in the reconstruction of Earth’s past history as set forth in the past chapters of\nthis volume cannot therefore be objected to.\nBROWN DWARF STARS\nBrown dwarf stars have now been numbered at 100 billion, rivaling the quantity of so-\ncalled “normal” stars in our galaxy.? The proposal that proto-Saturn commenced its career as\nsuch a star which had been floating alone in space might have raised scientific eyebrows in\nthe past. Not so these days. Although some brown dwarfs do orbit sun-like stars, the majority\nof them float through the galaxy independently.3\nThe similarity between dwarf stars and our posited proto-Saturnian sun does not end\nthere. That proto-Saturn could have acted as a dim sun is given credence by what is being\ndiscovered about brown dwarfs most of which are actually red.4 As Subhanjoy Mohanty and\nRay Jayawardhana have assured their readers, the atmosphere of young brown dwarfs should\nclosely resemble those of low-mass stars.> In fact, as the same authorities, to say nothing of\nothers, tell us, brown dwarfs occupy an intermediate slot between planets and stars.®\nThe mytho-historical record upon which we initially based our proto-Saturnian scenario\nalso led us to believe that proto-Saturn was surrounded by a placental cloud, otherwise known\nas a circumstellar disk.

Keeping to the theory of planet formation in gen-\neral, the accepted modus operandi re the formation of brown dwarf attendants is through ac-\ncretion from the debris contained in circumstellar disks.

Both approaches leave major questions unanswered...[Future] studies\nwill provide the observational tests needed to determine whether theoreticians’\namusements have a place in the real universe.”!°\n“The truth,” Adam Frank was honest enough to admit, “is that astronomers still do not\nknow much about the origin of planets” and that “our solar system is something of an odd-\nball.”!!

Core accretion itself, according to Frank, “is\nrife with uncertainties,”? and “all of these theories and their impressive-looking conclusions\nare only as good as the assumptions built into them.” And then, that disk accretion, in what-\never flavor, cannot account for the formation of planets is evidenced by disks surrounding\nolder stars known to already harbor planets. Nor could these disks be ephemeral leftovers\nfrom previous planet formation because some of them, “for unknown reasons,” are “100\ntimes as thick as the dust in our solar system.”*\n\nThe alternative is the plasma ejection model which claims that planetesimals form\nfrom “knots” within astral jets>— which includes those of brown dwarf stars and thus also\nproto-Saturn—from where they continue to condense into bigger and more massive\nbodies. As revolutionary as this might presently appear, a growing number of\nastrophysicists have endorsed this mechanism in past years, as others continue to do at\npresent.6\n\nHEAT RETENTION AND DISSIPATION\n\nWe have seen that brown dwarf stars can shed enough warmth to sustain life on any plan-\nets they might harbor in their vicinity. The only objection that might be raised against this as\nit pertains to our scenario concerns proto-Saturn’s mass. Having accepted proto-Saturn to\nhave been a sub-brown dwarf, one might wonder if it would have been massive enough to\ndeliver the required heat. But, despite past theories, it has now been discovered that the\nretention and dissipation of heat is not necessarily reliant on mass. This was indicated by the\ntwo brown dwarfs which orbit around each other in the Orion Nebula, the calculated\ntemperatures of which have put astronomers in yet one more quandary.\n\n“The results [Robert Naeye reported] appear to have put astronomers in the awkward\nposition of knowing /ess about brown dwarfs than they did before. The problem stems\nfrom the fact that the more massive of the two brown dwarfs is 140° C (252° F) cooler\nthan its counterpart. This flies in the face of theoretical models, which confidently pre-\ndict that massive brown dwarfs start off hotter and take longer to radiate away their\nheat of formation. ‘This is a mystery,’ says [Keivan] Stassun. “The less massive brown\ndwarf is hotter. No theoretical model of brown dwarfs predicts that’.”7\n\nMeantime, astronomers continue to puzzle over the fact that Saturn “radiates a lot of heat,\nmore than can be accounted for” from what it receives from the Sun.’ The latest theory that",

First discovered in 1988,> it was recognized as the “zonally symmetric current” pro-\nduced by “an atmospheric jet stream.” As happened later with Saturn’s south polar hurricane,\nthe feature surprised astronomers because its position remained fixed.” The jet, however, is\nfar from static since it’s known to twist around itself.\nDecades later, Saturn’s hexagon topped the astronomical news again since clearer images\nfrom the Cassini spacecraft showed that the feature was still in place. 15,000 miles (25,000\nSaturn’s south polar hurricane.\n(Photograph courtesy of NASA.)\nkilometers) across—large enough to fit four Earth-sized planets within its borders—the\nstructure extends about 60 miles (100 kilometers) down into Saturn’s clouds.
