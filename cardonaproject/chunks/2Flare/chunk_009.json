Such an event, however, would leave\nstriations on both slopes of such a hill. But since, as we have seen, the authors in question\nthemselves noted that the upheaval of land which raised most of the world’s mountains oc-\ncurred at the end of the Pleistocene, I find the above somewhat strange when presented as an\nobjection to glacial mechanical action. Should they not have realized that, when these stria-\ntions were gouged out, the land bearing their signs would still have been relatively flat? The\nstriations would then have been raised when the land itself was uplifted. This would also\nexplain why these striations appear only on the northern or north-western faces of high hills\nand mountains, since the southern faces would have previously lain underground. Hills and\nmountains are not always raised as blisters on the surface of the land. While some are due to\nfolding of the crust, many are owe their origin to faults which shear the land which is then\nuplifted where only one side of the elevated land would have been part of the original level\nground.\n\nThis also applies to those erratic boulders which now “perch precariously in long lines\nalong mountain crests, or lie singly upon the very summits of lofty eminences.”! Originally,\nthese erratics would have been deposited on relatively level ground. They would then have\nbeen raised to their lofty perches when the land was uplifted long after the Ice Age had come\nto an end. So, likewise, with other drift material which is now found on highland summits.\nThis would then explain “the well-established fact that many glaciated hills and mountains in\nthe northern hemisphere are scored and striated from top to bottom on their northern sides\nonly.” In keeping with their acceptance that the land was uplifted at the end of the\nPleistocene, it does not do for them to remark that, according to orthodoxy, the ice-sheets\nwould have had to have “glaciated the northern and north-western faces of these eminences\nas they slowly crawled up them but failed to glaciate the southern slopes as they presumably\naccelerated down them...”? But, given that the land over which these glaciers “crawled” was\nrelatively flat, and that this land was raised to its present level only after the Ice Age had\ncome to an end, the conundrum disappears.\n\nBesides, were we to adopt the hypothesis that these erratics were actually transported by\nthe wild surging of a flood,? the theory would still be burdened with the same conundrum.\n\nLet us say that a tremendous surge of water could have transported huge slabs of rock up\nmountain sides. Since some of these erratics are found on the very summits of hills and\nmountains, it would necessarily mean that the upwelling flood would have topped the crests\nof these elevations. Why, then, did they not leave some of their detritus on the opposite\nsouthern slopes?\n\nAllan and Delair also note the occurrence of erratics and striations in areas “far beyond\nthe limits of the most extensively conceived ice-sheets.” Among these they mention erratic\nboulders in the Sahara Desert, on the Mongolian plains, and in sub-tropical Uruguay.

As he argued: “The marks left by\nthick ice in Africa and India...are compelling evidence that the poles have wandered from\nwhat is today’s equator to the actual [that is present] poles.”4\n\nWhat these investigators seem to forget is that the ice age which gripped the present area\nof the Sahara occurred “some 440 million to 465 million years ago,”> in the Ordovician pe-\nriod, when Africa, South America, India, Australia, and Antarctica were still joined together\nin the supercontinent that has been named Gondwana. What must be kept in mind is that this\nsupercontinent was located in Earth’s southern hemisphere. And, judging by the direction in\nwhich the glaciers traveled, as indicated by the signs they left behind, it does seem that the\nsouth pole was then located plumb in the middle of the Sahara region. It is not, however the\npoles that have wandered from this locality, but, rather the continents themselves.\n\nNow it is true that glaciologists had previously placed the south pole during this interim\nin East Antarctica (see map on page 11 of this same work). But, for one thing, with the conti-\nnents splitting and shifting, there is no reason why both Africa and Antarctica could not have\npassed over the pole at different times. For another, beyond a general profile, the actual con-\nfiguration of Gondwana is still somewhat imperfectly known.\n\nAllan and Delair can thus only claim that glacial signatures in the Sahara and similar lo-\ncalities occur “far beyond the limits of the most extensively conceived ice-sheets” because\ntheir particular cosmic scenario only allows for one ice age, that of the Pleistocene.\n\nOf course, following the assumptions of V. Oppenheim® and A. J. Mantura,’ Allan and\nDelair have questioned the adequacy, if not the very validity, of continental drift. But while\none can argue the actual fit of the continents prior to separation, the correct paths they\nfollowed in drifting, and, yes, even the rate of drift, to say nothing of the length of periods\ninvolved, the science of plate tectonics can now be said to be securely established.\n\nWhile I am at it, I might as well lay Barbiero’s particular hypothesis to rest. As in other\ntheories before his, the pole shift he envisions is assumed to have been caused by an asteroi-\ndal impact. Unlike others before him, however, he was astute enough to realize that, in order\nto shift Earth’s axis, such an impact would have to have been a grazing one. More than that,",

But as he himself was honest enough to confess, this condition would have no more\nthan a 50% chance of probability. “Therefore, the probability that an impact results in a\nshifting of the poles is smaller than 50%, regardless of the size of the asteroid.”? As he rea-\nsoned, “we can reasonably expect this probability to be in the range of 10% for objects with a\nmass of adequate value.”\nTrue enough, his calculations also indicate the probability of “at least 4 collisions each\nmillion year period with objects as large as one kilometre or more.”4 Even so, a 10% prob-\nability for the perfect grazing blow to shift Earth’s axis is already low enough. And while this\nis theoretically applicable to one ice age—say that of the Pleistocene—the probability is se-\nverely lessened when the same cause is hypothesized, time and again, for an entire series of\nice ages.\nMORAINES\nAllan and Delair are also incorrect when they state that “neither mountain glaciers generally,\nnor the Antarctic or Greenland ice-sheets, are now accumulating extensive ‘drift’-like\ndeposits”>— although we do note their caution in their use of the words “generally” and\n“extensive,” to say nothing of their own admittance that “moraines are today found at the\nfoot of many glaciers.” Only at their “foot”? The truth is that all glaciers accumulate drift,\nunderneath, to their sides, and up in front of them.\nThis, they then tell us, “does not necessarily signify that every moraine associated with\n‘drift’ deposits was actually produced by glacial action.” How else, then, can moraines be\nformed? As they inform us: “A receding sea-tide will leave what is essentially a moraine\nupon a beach...”” True—but this can hardly be compared to terminal moraines left behind by\nthe melting glaciers of past ice ages, some of which constitute entire hills measuring up to\n150 feet in height.’\nThey also tell us that “at least one good record is known of a morainic structure formed\nby unusually severe cloudbursts— moraines which covered several acres and contained trees,\nsoil, stones and boulders weighing up to an estimated 100 tonnes each.”? Here they refer to\nan event that took place in 1872 and reported by A. M. Gibson in the Alabama Geological\nSurvey in 1895.

Several scars of even greater magnitude\nwere scoured on the south-east side, where rocks of all sizes were swept down and heaped\nover acres of ground.! It is one of these slabs that was calculated to weigh a hundred tons—\nbut not “tonnes” as Allan and Delair have it.2 But let that pass—we are still speaking of an\nenormous slab.\nSo what can be said against this? Well, yes, floods have been known to carry away not\nonly trees and boulders, but roads, buildings, and bridges too, scattering them along the way.\nBut these can hardly be classified as moraines. Actually, one can revert Allan and Delair’s\nadage by claiming that this “does not necessarily signify that every moraine-like pile of de-\nbris was actually produced by flood action.” I would have liked to say that this is a sword\nthat cuts both ways, but, unfortunately, in this particular case, one side of the sword is se-\nverely blunted. Thus, the swath of destruction left behind by the Coosa Mountain cloudburst\nmight have been moraine-like, but it hardly qualifies as a terminal moraine. We are not here\nso much concerned with lateral or median moraines. Our concern is with terminal moraines.\nFor a flood of water to leave behind a terminal moraine that is over a hundred foot high\nwould require a wave of the same height or higher. Such a wave would then have to come to\na sudden halt and retreat in order to leave its hundred-foot-high rubble piled up behind—a\nvirtual impossibility, needless to say. Only advancing and retreating glaciers can accomplish\nsuch a feat.\nI will, however, grant that there are cases in which water-transported debris is found in\nassociation with glacial action and thus not always easily identifiable. Thus, to give but one\nexample:\n“Near the border of Montana and Idaho...an arm of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet blocked\nthe Clark Fork River valley, holding back the water until it formed a lake with an area\nof more than 3,000 square miles. When the glacial dam eventually gave way, an esti-\nmated 300 cubic miles of water burst out—probably within a matter of days. The\nroaring torrent greatly deepened the river valley and carried boulders that measured\nmore than 35 feet in diameter for hundreds of miles across the Columbia Plateau.”\nNo terminal moraine was, however, left behind by this roaring torrent. Besides, glacial\nmoraines, especially terminal ones, are so distinctively positioned that, by relying on the gla-\ncial theory, Louis Agassiz, as many others after him, could correctly predict exactly where\nthey would be found even in terrain that was entirely foreign to him.4\nNevertheless, despite all the above, it can safely be concluded that, once their reliance on\nSitchin’s particular cosmic scenario is ignored, Allan and Delair have gone a long way in il-",

With all of this,\nwe heartily agree.\nTHE GLACIAL HECATOMBS\nWas the onslaught of ice ages, especially that of the Pleistocene, gradual or sudden?\nThis is a question with which both orthodox glaciologists and unorthodox catastrophists have\ngrappled for many years. Back in 1958, Dolph Hooker could write that “there is evidence\nthat glacial ice appeared with catastrophic suddenness.”!\n“There is evidence that at a time when temperate climatic conditions extended even\ninto polar regions, the world, teeming with warmth-loving species of floral and ani-\nmal life, was overwhelmed by a fall of snow, ice and rain, so violent, so sudden, so\nchilling, that great numbers of creatures were forthwith destroyed; so vast, so violent\nthat it brought to an abrupt end one geologic age and ushered in another. In many ar-\neas over the globe fossils of the buried dead eloquently testify to the suddenness and\nviolence of the catastrophe which destroyed them. We even find it quite unnecessary\nto rely only upon skeletal remains. We are given the amazingly conclusive evidence\nof complete bodies, not just bones, of mammoths, rhinoceroses and other mammals\nwhich were destroyed and put into the deep freeze of arctic, glacial ice so suddenly\nthat grass, branches and leaves of hard-wood trees they were eating at the moment did\nnot have time to digest!”\nThis same evidence had been used, eight years earlier, by Immanuel Velikovsky in his\naxial tilt scenario:\n“The sudden extermination of mammoths was caused by a catastrophe and probably\nresulted from asphyxiation or electrocution. The immediately subsequent movement\nof the Siberian continent into the polar region is probably responsible for the preser-\nvation of the corpses.\n“Tt appears that the mammoths, along with other animals, were killed by a tempest of\ngases accompanied by a spontaneous lack of oxygen caused by fires raging high in\nthe atmosphere. A few instants later their dying or dead bodies were moving into the\npolar circle.”3\nBy 1970, other voices were being heard. Keeping to his model of a shifting crust, Charles\nHapgood used the same data as evidence for the sudden onslaught of the Ice Age:",
