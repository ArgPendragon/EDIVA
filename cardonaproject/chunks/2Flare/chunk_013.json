There is no point in repeating the\nlengthy discussion of this subject which we presented in our previous volume. We will omit\nhere mention of ancient Chinese,! Hindu,? and Mesoamerican astronomical knowledge? but\na brief synopsis of what the Greeks and Babylonians knew concerning the heavens above\nthem will not be entirely amiss.\n\nIn about 525 B.C. Pythagoras was already teaching that Earth was a sphere, rather than\nbeing flat as had long been believed. In the late 4th century B.C., Herakleides already knew\nthat Earth revolves on its axis,4 as so did Plato, Hiketas, and Ekphantos.5 Thanks to Aristar-\nchus of Samos (circa 270 B.C.), long before Copernicus it was already known that the Sun\nwas at the centre of the Solar System with the planets revolving around it, and it is unfortu-\nnate that the later Claudius Ptolemy thought this ridiculous, favoring Earth, in lieu of the Sun,\nas the centre of the Solar System.’ Eratosthenes (c.273-192 B.C.) even managed to measure\nEarth’s circumference® “with an error of only half a percent.”? That most complex motion of\nEarth’s axis known as the precession of the equinoxes, which is one of the mainstays of the\nMilankovitch theory of ice ages, was discovered by Hipparchus who lived sometime between\n146 and 127 B.C.'° Anaxagoras knew that the Moon shone with light reflected from the Sun,\nthat it harbored mountains, and that the stars were hot like the Sun.'! Hipparchus even\ncalculated the distance of the Moon from Earth “with startling accuracy,” involving an error\nof no more than 0.3 percent.!? That the planets both rotated on their own axes and moved on\ntheir orbits was well known to Plato, Long before Edmund Halley, Seneca had already\nunderstood the real nature of comets,!? including their periodic return to Earth’s vicinity.!+\nNor did the Greeks restrict their knowledge to what they could actually see and measure. As\nfar back as the fourth century B.C., Metrodorus of Chios already knew how absurd it was to\nbelieve that Earth was the only world in existence, or that life is to be found only on Earth,!5\nDemocritus even stated his belief that worlds like Earth were infinite in number, though\nvarying in bulk.!¢",

They had also determined the\nsynodic revolution of the Moon within a small fraction of the correct value. They knew that\neach planet had its own particular course with its speed and periods of time subject to change\nand variation. They knew that Earth was spherical in shape and actually counted it among the\nplanets. They knew that the Moon shone with the reflected light from the Sun and that lunar\neclipses were due to the shadow that Earth casts upon the lunar surface. As recorded in a se-\nries of cuneiform tablets which are now known as the Babylonian astronomical diaries, these\nearly astronomers had already calculated the length of the lunar months. They recorded lunar\nand solar eclipses; the dates of first visibility for Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn; the first and last\nvisibilities of Venus and Mercury; the dates of the equinoxes and solstices; the “conjunction”\nof the Moon and each of the planets with various stars; and various other phenomena.\n\nWhen it comes to comets, which were not admitted into the family of astronomical\nbodies until the time of Edmund Halley and Isaac Newton, we find that the Babylonian\nastronomers, referred to as Chaldeans by Greek classical writers, had already recognized\nthem as such. As Seneca, who lived between 4 B.C. and A.D. 65, had it recorded:\n“Apollonius [of Myndus] says that the Chaldeans place comets in the category of planets and\nhave determined their orbits”? and that a comet is “a celestial body on its own, like the Sun\nand the Moon.”3\n\nAs we noted in our previous volume, the technical data—measurements, calculations—\ngiven in cubits and degrees in the Babylonian astronomical diaries are evidence of a\nsophisticated attempt at reconciling once mysterious motions with numerical allocation,\nwhile the glosses contained in the astronomical diaries concerning obstruction of visibility by\nbad weather on certain nights are indicative of diligent observation.4 As Richard Stephenson\ndocumented, Babylonian astronomical records are so accurate that, even now, they are prov-\ning useful to modern astronomers in calculating the changes in the length of the day.5\n\nOf course, it is difficult to ascertain how far back beyond the middle of the seventh cen-\ntury B.C. Babylonian, or for that matter Mesopotamian, astronomy might have stretched. Nor\ncan we now determine what else the Babylonians might have told us concerning the evolu-\ntion of the Solar System as they may have believed in it. This is because Nabonassar is\nknown to have destroyed previously existing observations in order that exact historical chro-\nnology would commence with his own reign as king of Babylon. No wonder it has been\nstated that astronomical observations do not reach beyond the reign of Nabonassar.”\n\nEven so, where does all this lead us to?",

        "content": "\nTHE SATURNIAN SUN\nThe first lesson we learned through our in-depth study of the mytho-historical record in\nour previous volume is that, as far as our primitive forefathers were concerned, planets were\ngods. Better said is that their gods were actually the planets. Thus, to them, gods and planets\nwere one and the same.\nMore than that, we learned that, strange as it may at first seem, the planet we now call\nSaturn was by the ancients considered to have been the most prominent of the planets.' What\nmakes this strange is that, at present, Saturn appears as a mere pin-point of light in the night\nsky which, unlike Venus, is not easily recognizable by the uninitiated. What is stranger still is\nthat Saturn was referred to as the star of the Sun and even outright as the Sun star.2 As the\nAssyro-Babylonians unequivocally tell us, Saturn was considered a virtual sun.3 What we\nalso learned is that many of the so-called Sun gods of the ancients were actually personi-\nfications of the planet Saturn. Donald MacKenzie, for instance, informs us that:\n“The sun god was identical with Ninip and Nin-Girsu...resembling Babbar, ‘the\nshining one’, the solar deity of Akkadian Sippar, whose Semitic name was Sha-\nmash.”4\nBut that Ninip (variant, Ninib or Nirig), also known as Ninurta, was the same as the\nGreek Kronos, the avowed name of the planet Saturn, even MacKenzie knew. For that\nmatter, Ningirsu, too, was a name of the planet Saturn. In fact, that the Assyro-Babylonian\nShamash, which most mythologists identify as the Sun, was actually the planet Saturn we\nknow from the Assyro-Babylonians themselves.”? As Cochrane has demonstrated:\n“Saturn’s identification with Shamash is attested in omen texts from the 13th century\nBC, for example. Saturn is also identified with Shamash in various astronomical re-\nports sent to Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal, and the cursory language employed by\nthe Assyrian astronomers makes it apparent that this identification was common\nknowledge and had long since become proverbial.”8\nThere is of course no doubt that, in later days, Shamash did stand for the Sun, but this is\nonly because once the Saturnian sun was no longer evident in the sky, its name was bestowed",

Mircea Eliade tells us that: “In Indonesia generally, the supreme divinity\nof the sky has either been amalgamated with or replaced by the god of the Sun; for instance I-\nlai of the Celebes has been assimilated into a sun god whom, however, the natives see as\ncontinuing the work of creation begun by I-lai; it is the same on Timor and innumerable other\nislands.”! This usage, however, was not restricted to Indonesia. It was, on the contrary, a\nprocedure that took place all over the ancient world. Thus Eliade could correctly state that,\n“generally speaking, we find [in early myth] only the palest shadow of what the sun hiero-\nphanies once meant, and constant rationalization makes it paler still.” Where we, however,\nbeg to differ is that these sun hierophanies were anything but pale.\nThat the Sun which presently radiates down upon us was not always the sun of mankind\nhad been known for ages. The writers of the Popul Vuh, who attempted to trace the mytho-\nlogical history of their Maya ancestors, did not eschew words when they wrote that:\n“Like a man was the sun when it showed itself. It showed itself when it was born and\nremained fixed in the sky like a mirror. Certainly, it was not the same sun which we\nsee, it is said in their old tales.”3\nLet us face it, all of the major so-called sun gods of the ancients were actually personifi-\ncations of the Saturnian sun. Even Ra, usually presented as the Egyptian sun-god par excel-\nlence,‘ turns out to have been imbued with characteristics and motions which are not, and can\nnever be, attributable to the present Sun. Thus Ra was lauded as having abided within a nest\nof rings or circles; of having been of an emerald color shedding rays of emerald hue; of\n“going up” on the west and “going down” on the east side of the sky; and of moving down at\ndawn and upstream at night.\nSo, likewise, with Yima who, as his alter ego Vaivasvata, or Vivasvant, was honored as a\nsun-god in the Zoroastrian tradition of ancient Persia.© But that the Persian Yima, the\nequivalent of the Hindu Yama, personified the planet Saturn is well known.”\nWe could go down the list of various so-called sun-gods only to find out that, originally,\nthey were actually Saturnian sun-gods, prime among whom we also find the Greek Helios\nhimself who, like Kronos, who was Saturn, was considered a Titan. Helios was also identi-\nfied with Dionysos,? whose Saturnian selfsameness need not be repeated.

A four-tiered Israelite cult stand from Taanach includes figures\nof a horse, an allusion to chariotry, and a sun symbol.! Similar finds were unearthed in\nJerusalem itself by that great dame of archaeology, Kathleen Kenyon, in an area she identi-\nfied as a cult centre dating from the time of Israel’s monarchy. What she discovered there\nwere “figurines of horses with an unnatural disk between their ears” which were definitely\nDies: of a sun were not only to be found in Jewish synagogues, but at earlier Isra-\nindicative of sun disks.? As Lucille Roussin informs us:\n“By analogy to finds in western Asia and Egypt, and through reference to the text of 2\nKings [concerning which see more below], Kenyon concluded that ‘horses with a\ndisk on the forehead are miniature models of the Horses of the Sun.’ The disk is not\nunlike the disk that represents Helios in the Sepphoris synagogue mosaic.\n“From this same period of Israel’s monarchy (seventh century B.C.E.), sun disks with\nwinged scarabs appear on various official seals...even on the personal seal of King\nHezekiah of Judah.”\nWhat should be noted is that both the winged disk and the scarab beetle were Egyptian\nsymbols of the god Ra whom we have already had occasion to equate with the Saturnian sun.\nMeanwhile, that a sun-chariot complete with horses was to be found at the entrance to Solo-\nmon’s Temple is attested to by the Second Book of Kings. It is there told that, in his attempt\nto reform the Israelite religion, Josiah, king of Judah, had occasion to destroy the horses and\nchariots of the sun-god which had been erected at the entrance to Solomon’s Temple.\n“And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the en-\ntering in of the house of Yahweh [usually rendered as “the Lord’”]...and burned the\nchariots of the sun with fire.”+",

And yet, the same is said of Helios\nin Jewish prayers of the Graeco-Roman period. “Hail Helios,” runs such a prayer, “thou God\nin the heavens, your name is mighty,” while an incantation invokes “Helios on the cheru-\nbim.”3\n\nIt is thus evident that, when we come upon such prayers to the Israelite deity as “You\nwho are enthroned on the cherubim, shine forth’* and “Restore us, O Elohim [usually ren-\ndered simply as ‘God’]; let your face shine,”5 we can be sure that the god being invoked is\none that radiated like a sun. So, likewise, when it is said that “Yahweh came from Sinai, and\ndawned from Seir upon us; he shone forth from Mount Paran.”6\n\nNeedless to say, Taylor attempted to rationalize these and similar instances by pointing\nout that, while idolatry had been rampant in the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, it had nothing\nto do with the official cult of Yahweh,’ as so did Hershel Shanks, the Editor of the periodical\nin which Taylor’s article was published.’ Like many other champions of the Jewish faith,\nthey are not alone in this since it has always been assumed, as the Old Testament itself\nproclaims, that the people of Israel, including their kings, had often embraced apostasy with-\nout actually abandoning the official religion. Judging by what the Old Testament has to say,\nhowever, it really is quite evident that this so-called apostasy had not only been rampant\nsince before the time of the united Israelite monarchy, it seems to have always been, as it re-\nmained, the status quo. The impression one receives is that, despite the ranting of the so-\ncalled prophets and Josiah’s attempted reform, the devotion to other gods was generally held\nto be syncretic with that promoted by the official cult. Even Hezekiah of Judah, described as\na king who rejected foreign practices, incorporated the Egyptianized symbols of the winged\nscarab and the winged sun disk,? both of which epitomized the god known as Ra. It becomes\nobvious then that this Saturnian symbol was not really viewed as being either foreign or\napostate. Moreover, if we are to take the presence of Helios in early synagogues at face\nvalue, it seems that there was little change in this syncretism even after the return of the Jews\nfrom their Babylonian exile.
