        "content": "ANCIENT TESTIMONY\n\nThat most of the authorities cited above wrote their treatises early in the twentieth century\nmight be mistaken for naiveté due to the embryonic state of geological knowledge as it\nexisted at the time. As we have seen, however, modern geologists are finally admitting the\noccurrence of punctuated catastrophism. Actually, a consensus that the face of the physical\nworld had been entirely different in primeval times had already been reached in the\neighteenth century. This, however, had been the result of a mixture that was part theology\nand part science. To quote Frank Manuel: “For reasons theological or scientific, or more\noften an admixture of both, inquirers arrived at the conclusion that the world of nature must\nhave undergone a whole succession of violent revolutions.”! The part that was science was\nunfortunately sullied by the likes of Thomas Burnet, whom Manuel referred to as “[t]hat\nseventeenth-century clergyman of fantasy,”? whose main aim was to “prove the Bible right.”\nThis was exemplified by Antonio Moro who “conjectured that God created the world a\nperfectly smooth marble sphere” and that it was not until the third day of Creation that “the\nprimary mountain chains” were raised.3\n\nWhile, at first sight, this appears to be somewhat damning from a scientific point of view,\nit actually conforms to a primitive belief that can be found in various parts of the world.\nBiblical-based theology cannot be made to account for these beliefs. Meanwhile, there is\nnothing in the Book of Genesis, or anywhere else in the Old Testament, which specifically\nclaims that the mountains were raised on the third day of Creation. But we do find it so\nrecorded in Jewish legend where it is stated that: “Up to this time [the third day of Creation]\nthe earth was a plain, and wholly covered with water.” And then “mountains appeared all\nover and hills.” It is therefore less than doubtful that Moro was quite familiar with this\ntradition as well as others. Meanwhile this much can be said: Since Creation is related to\nhave commenced with the shedding of light, understood here as proto-Saturn’s flare-up, it\nbecomes understandable that the raising of the mountains, which followed the shedding of\nthe light, would be included in the tales of Creation.\n\nNeedless to say, Moro’s claim that Earth was originally “a perfectly smooth marble\nsphere” is nothing but fantasy. And yet, all over the world, the belief is found recorded that,\nin primeval times, the land was flat. Louis Ginzberg, for instance, tells us that: “The\nconception that the mountains did not originally belong to the earth’s form is prevalent in\nlegend...”6 As it is told in another Jewish source: “The earth, which originally consisted of a\nlevel surface, became mountainous as a punishment for having received Abel’s blood.”? Not\nonly that, but, during the mythical generation of Enosh—not to be confused with Enoch—the\nraising of the mountains is correctly associated with the inundation of the sea. As it was told,",

        "content": "\n“the ocean flooded a third part of the earth; there arose mountains, valleys, and rocky ground,\nwhereas prior to that everything had been smooth and even...”! And: “God caused the sea to\ntransgress its bounds, and a portion of the earth was flooded. This was the time also when the\nmountains became rocks...”?\nA similar series of events is ably, if concisely, described by the Chinese in the Sing-Li-\nTa-Tsiuen-Chou. “In a general convulsion of nature,” it is there related, “the sea is carried out\nof its bed, mountains spring out of the ground, rivers change their courses, human beings and\neverything are ruined, and the ancient traces effaced.”3 Moreover, the connection of this tec-\ntonic violence with Creation is not unique to Jewish lore. Thus G. H. Luquet informs us that:\n“Tn various Battak tribes of Sumatra, earthquakes are linked with cosmogony myths.\nUnder various forms, all more or less determined, the idea is that the creation of the\nworld was a disadvantage for a being already in existence, who reacted with a\nviolent agitation which destroyed the earth.”’4\nSimilar legends were told by other primitive peoples, such as the Kayan of Borneo who\npassed on the belief that valleys were hollowed out by a crab. But this was no ordinary crab\nsince the creature had been one which had fallen from the sky.5 Natives in the north-west of\nthe same country also tell how the two birds responsible for Creation ended up with an Earth\nthat was larger than the sky. In order to adjust for this miscalculation, they squished the earth,\n“and this caused the foldings which made mountains and valleys.”6 As we noted earlier, the\nEskimos of the Bering Strait also tell that “in the days of the first people on the earth plain,\nthere were no mountains far or near.”7\nThe mountains known as the Cuillins on the Isle of Skye, one of the Hebrides, off the\nnorth-west coast of Scotland, are volcanic in origin. Dorothy Vitaliano described them as\n“made of gabbro, a type of rock which crystallizes from molten matter, but far below the sur-\nface rather than on it.” They are, as Vitaliano herself tells us, “the deep roots of volcanoes”\nwhich geologists claim to have been active in the Tertiary,’ that is the period before the\nQuaternary which includes the Pleistocene epoch. Thus, these volcanoes would have been ac-\ntive before the last Ice Age. And yet there is a Scottish legend which accounts for the forma-\ntion of the Cuillins. As is often the case, the legend has been preserved in an allegorical form.\nIt goes like this:\nCailleach Bhur, the Hag of the Ridges, which stood for Winter, held a lovely maiden pris-\noner. This maiden was so loved by Spring that she begged the Sun to free her. The Sun flung\nhis fiery spear at Cailleach Bhur, but missed her. Instead the spear hit the ground where an",

The hag, that is Winter, ran away and was never seen\nagain.!\nThat Cailleach Bhur could not originally have stood for normal winter is evidenced by\nthe fact that, when she ran away, she was never seen again. As we all know and needless to\nsay, present normal winters continue to follow in succession in Scotland, as everywhere else.\nThe only winter man remembers as having departed never to be seen again is the long winter\nof the last Ice Age.\nBut, more important than that, the description of how the Cuillins were raised matches\nthe manner in which volcanic mountains are raised. Concerning the Scottish legend just\nrelated, the same Vitaliano tells us that the “notion of a blister forming the earth’s surface\nand discharging a red-hot mass could only have been imagined by some early inhabitants of\nSkye, for volcanism in the Hebrides has been extinct for millions of years.”? Yet even she\ncould not help noting that “nevertheless it could almost be an eye-witness account of the\nformation of a volcanic dome.”3 One of these domes, Vitaliano tells us, formed on the shores\nof Lake Toya on the Japanese island of Hokkaido as recently as 1943.\n“On December 28, 1943, a series of sharp earthquakes began to shake the shores [of\nthe lake], and a huge blister began to swell the ground near the volcano Usu. Within\nsix months it had risen to 165 feet above the normal ground level, and on June 23,\n1944, it burst and erupted volcanic ash. It continued to grow, and ash continued to be\nerupted in small explosions. Finally, in November 1944, a dome of red-hot but solid\nlava started to protrude through the still-rising bulge. When the dome, named Showa-\nShinzan (“the-new-mountain-of-the-reign-of-Showa”), reached a height of 990 feet\nabove the original level of the land, it stopped growing; that was in September 1945,\nand today [1973] Showa-Shinzan is still vigorously discharging vapor.”*\nTo which Vitaliano adds: “If this happened long ago, and was described only in some local\nlegend of the Ainu people who inhabited Hokkaido before the Japanese, surely we would think\nit very much exaggerated, or even fictitious.”> And so, also, despite Vitaliano herself, with the\nScottish legend concerning the creation of the Cuillins—for, really, how could the ancestors of\nthe Celts have described such a volcanic blister had they not seen one in action. There is, after\nall, nothing which at present resembles a blister in all of the Cuillins range.\nWe have also already seen how the North American Indians of Washington state recount\nthat: “When the world was very young, the land was flat where the Cascades now rise.” Then,\nas is often usual with these reminiscences, as a punishment for some committed offense, the\nGreat Spirit “leaned down from heaven and [like the celestial crab of the Kayan] scooped up a",

Here, once again, we see the correct\nassociation of the raising of mountains with the incursion of the sea. Also already mentioned\nis the legend connected with the origins of Lake Chelan in the same state. “Once,” it is said,\n“there were no mountains or lakes in this part of the country, only a grassy prairie with abun-\ndant game.” But here it was not as punishment that the Great Spirit struck the earth so that\nthe ground shook while an immense cloud descended and hid the land. When the cloud\ncleared, the entire area was changed. “Where there had been a plain there was now a range of\nlofty mountains; deep canyons marked the places where the rocks and dirt had been removed\nto make the mountains.”?\nFurther south the Klamath Indians tell of a past conflict that took place between two\ngodlike chiefs stationed on two mountains, one on Mount Mazama in Oregon, the other on",

What is more interesting is that simply by looking at Crater\nLake, the indigenes would have had no idea how the cavity that holds the lake could have\nbeen produced. It is therefore more than probable that they actually witnessed the collapse of\nMount Mazama and the later flooding of the crater.

Other whale bones have been discovered north of Lake\nOntario 440 feet above sea level,” as also in Vermont at a height exceeding 500 feet above\nsea level, and in the Montreal-Quebec area at about 600 feet above sea level.4 Although, as\nVelikovsky noted,> whales do occasionally enter the St. Lawrence River, whales on the hills\nin the regions of Vermont and Montreal would have required either an oceanic tide of vast\nproportions—which, coming from the east, in our case would have been due to tidal rebound\nor the later regaining of Earth’s previous momentum—if not to a lowering of the land.\nMarine creatures dating to the Pleistocene have also been found at altitudes exceeding 200\nfeet above sea level along the Gulf coast east of the Mississippi River.®\n\nBut even these elevations are nothing when compared to the whale bones that have been\ndiscovered in the Andes at an altitude of 5,000 feet.” Nor will it do to explain these remains\nas those of whales which died and settled on the sea bottom to be covered by sediments\nbefore the sea bed rose gently to form the Andes millions of years ago.

That a tidal wave would have swept the\nwest coast of South America due to the braking of Earth’s axial spin we have already seen.\nBut it is doubtful that this wave would have been higher than the Andes. A wave that high\nwould have swept over half the South American continent leaving very little alive, if\nanything, in its wake. And yet, the fact that other marine life together with such land animals\nas camels and even rhinoceros were found together with the whales well illustrates the titanic\nforce with which the wave must have hit.

The site of their discovery has been proclaimed too deep\nwithin the cave-system for the bones to have been “flushed” in through natural means. Either\nthe bones had been carried inside the caves by humans or the mastodons would have had to\nhave walked in themselves when still alive before the cave was inundated.?\nCoastal regions would have naturally been some of the preferred areas to be occupied by\nearly man. Thus it is that quite a few of these sites were swamped by the rising sea level as\ndemonstrated by D. Prigent and his colleagues.?
