Well, yes, as Hays and company concluded, their analysis did show\n“that changes in the earth’s orbital geometry are the fundamental cause of the succession of\nQuaternary ice ages.” But, as Rose explained, only by adjusting both the theoretical ex-\npectations and the factual findings “after which there [was] still a need for extensive statisti-\ncal manipulation in order to generate a fit.” In other words: “ad hoc reasoning, and self-ful-\nfilling prophecy.’\n“Tf there really were a good fit between astronomical retrocalculation on the one\nhand, and the historical record as suggested by the deep oceanic sediment cores on\nthe other hand, it would already be there for all to see, perhaps with different sorts of\ntime lags here and there, but with no statistical manipulation required.”\nNor was this only Rose’s verdict. D. Evans and H. Freeland were of the same opinion\nwhen they criticized some of the procedures utilized by Hays and his team and finally con-\ncluded that “while these results may be tantalizing, they fall far short of confirming the Mi-\nlankovitch hypothesis; there may be an astronomical effect, but it is evidently small...At pre-\nsent, however, the data do not support the conclusion of cause and effect relationships.”!°\nHays and company, of course, replied, but, as Rose noted, “only with some strenuous back-",

Or, as Bernard\nNewgrosh phrased it:\n“Tt is indeed a puzzle why a 0.1% variation in Earth’s orbital eccentricity should be\nthought to give rise to such large effects as ice ages. The only conclusion I can draw\nis that the scientists are too stubborn to look for an alternative causative mechanism.”\nEven so, interest in the Milankovitch theory did go through a revival. What is worse, the\ngeneral public was still being fed the myth that the Milankovitch cycles “control the amount\nof sunlight received by the two hemispheres in winter and summer” and that [m]uch of this\ntheory is supported by deep-sea sediments.” Not only that, a note of gloom and doom was\nbeing sounded concerning the return of an ice age as predicted by the Milankovitch theory.\nNote, for instance, Samuel Matthews who, in 1987, was deceived into asking:\n“Under the inexorable Milankovitch cycles of earth’s solar orbit, will the great conti-\nnental ice sheets again begin growing?

Harking back to Hays and Imbrie’s deep-sea sedimentary evi-\ndence, it had been calculated that the last set of glaciers began to melt about 14,000 years\nago; the next to last glacial retreat was placed at about 128,000 years ago. Despite criticism\nby other geologists, Imbrie was so sure of what the sedimentary evidence had to say that he\nwent out on a limb by stating that if that latter date ever turns out to be wrong, “then a good\npart of the Milankovitch theory fails.” It took Isaac Winograd to prove that that date was\nwrong. Winograd’s reasoning was this:\nThe glaciers are believed to have covered something like eleven million square miles of\nland with a miles-thick sheet. With all the water it took to build this massive ice sheet re-\nmoved from the ocean, sea level would have been about 350 feet lower than at present.

As Kunzig reported:\n“The ice-age chronology from Devils Hole was shifted well back in time compared\nwith the chronology from the deep-sea sediments. According to the sediments, for ex-\nample, [the next to last glacial retreat] happened about 128,000 years ago; according\nto the Devils Hole calcite, it happened at least 147,000 years ago.”?\n“What difference does 19,000 years make?” asked Kunzig. And he answered:\n“To the straightforward version of the Milankovitch theory, it makes a big\ndifference. According to orbital calculations, 128,000 years ago the high latitudes of\nthe Northern Hemisphere were getting an unusually large amount of sunlight during\nthe summer—just what was needed, in Imbrie’s model, to melt the glaciers.

Fine—he had his own axe to grind. But did other\nglaciologists jump on Winograd’s band-wagon?— Hardly.\nAs opponents of Winograd and his team pointed out:\n“The 128,000 year date for the next-to-last ice melt is supported by several independ-\nent lines of evidence, ranging from coral reefs in Barbados—which show that that sea\nlevel was very high around 125,000 years ago—to limestone formations in Antarctic\nlakes.

Instead as on the land, the response of the\nNorth Atlantic Ocean atmosphere system increasingly looks like a series of abrupt\nflip-flops from one stage to another.”!\nSUMMING UP\nMuch more can be said, as it has been said, for and against the Milankovitch theory, but\nat its heart lie the following problems:\n(1) There seems to be solid evidence that ice ages ended abruptly “with temperatures\nrising to their warmest levels even more rapidly than the ice sheets melted.” During\nthe glacial periods “the temperature has also fluctuated rapidly and dramatically.” The\nproblem here is that the orbital cycles inherent in the Milankovitch theory do not pro-\nvide “for such bursts of climatic change.”?\n(2) It has never been understood how the cooling of the northern hemisphere could ac-\ncount for the accompanying glaciation of the southern one. “Glaciers in the Andes\nand Antarctica have advanced at roughly the same times as those in the north, that is,\nat times when the orbital calculations [inherent in the Milankovitch theory] indicate\nthat the Southern Hemisphere should have been getting a lot of summer sunlight.”3\n(3) The extent to which the shape of Earth’s orbit fluctuates varies with a period of about\n10,000 years. This seems to fit the cycle of recurring ice ages which have also been\ncalculated to occur every 10,000 years. And it is this, more than anything else, which\nhas made the Milankovitch theory so seductive. Unfortunately, as already noted, that\nvariation in Earth’s orbit only changes the amount of sunlight that reaches the north-\nern hemisphere “by less than half a percent.”\n“Tn contrast, the shorter tilt and wobble cycles change the amount of Northern Hemi-\nsphere summer sunlight by as much as 20 percent. The question researchers have\nasked ever since the Milankovitch theory came back into vogue is: Why should the\nweakest orbital cause have the strongest geologic effect?’”’>\n(4) But even the variation of Earth’s tilt is problematic in this respect. As Hoyle noted,\n“slight changes in the tilt of the Earth’s axis of spin give only negligible solar varia-\ntions at equatorial latitudes; yet the last ice age produced the great glaciers on Mauna\nLoa and Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and Mount Elgon in Uganda. Obviously something\ndrastic happened in the tropics for which the Milankovitch theory cannot account.”6",

Rose even warned catastrophists, of whom he is one himself,\nnot to relinquish the theory altogether. “It is even more regrettable,” he thus continued, “that\ncatastrophists have hitherto shunned the theory, apparently on the grounds that it is somehow\ntainted because it has been used in defense of uniformitarianism.”? As he continues:\n“Tn its most general sense, the Milankovitch theory is concerned with the patterns of\ninsolation during various orbital circumstances, and the effects that that insolation\nwould have on climate, especially in terms of glaciation. When viewed in this way,\nthe Milankovitch theory does not have to be uniformitarian at all.”\nHowever, the Milankovitch theory, as formulated by Milankovitch, is uniformitarian, and\nthis is a fact that Rose was not only aware of, but one he himself stressed. Milankovitch’s\napproach was “to assume that the present orbit has been in place for an indefinitely long\ntime, and that minor cyclical and secular changes of various sorts can be retrocalculated into\nthe past.” If we then remove these factors from the Milankovitch theory, it is no longer the\nMilankovitch theory, and all that Rose can claim is that the ice ages can be attributed to an\nastronomical cause. I agree. But no matter how much Rose may argue, that astronomical\ncause cannot be the one advocated by Milankovitch.\nAs of this writing, and despite the many objections brought against it, the Milankovitch\ntheory still has its adherents. More than that, the theory is even now made to account for ef-\nfects other than ice ages. Thus, Martin Claussen, together with his graduate student Claudia\nKubatzki, have now used the Milankovitch model to account for hotter northern summers,\nstronger monsoons, and a greener Sahara Desert.

Coleman wrote in 1926: “During many years of study of glaciations I have\nhoped to find a solution of the difficulties in several theories at different times but have al-\nways encountered some point where they failed.”! Or, as John Bradley, Jr., put it: “Although\nmany explanations have been offered, no universally acceptable hypothesis for the causes of\nglaciation has yet been pronounced.” And, as W. B. Wright announced in 1937: “It must be\nadmitted that among the theories which have been brought forward to account for the phe-\nnomena of the Ice Ages, there is not a single one which meets the facts of the case in such a\nmanner as to inspire confidence.”\nWriting in 1958, Dolph Hooker commented:\n“The criticism may be made that the above opinions are old and out of date; yet the\nfact is that every theory in existence today had been previously expounded and was\nstudied by the above critics before their conclusions were reached. Many recent in-\nvestigators have arrived at the same conclusions which have been cited.”4\nIn his own work, Hooker enumerates various of these theories, but, as others before him,\nhe reached the same conclusion: “Every one has been analyzed and thoroughly studied by\nleading scientists throughout the world; and every single one has been rejected as unten-\nable.”5\nBut that was in 1958. Is the situation any better at present?\nA SIMPLE MATTER OF SEVERE WINTERS\nIn 1970, Hubert Lamb and Alastair Woodroffe, both British scientists, seemed to wonder\nwhat the ruckus about ice ages was all about. To them the answer seemed a simple matter.\nBecoming known as the Snowblitz Theory, their explanation was that “an ice age could be\nstarted by nothing more dramatic than a succession of harsh winters.” The high latitudes of\nEurope would have suffered several years of severe winters which would have been followed",

The snow on hills and mountains would thus endure through the summers.\nThe snow’s increased reflectivity of solar rays would reduce temperatures, more snow would\nfall, and less would melt. Given a series of such harsh weather conditions, ice sheets would\neventually develop.! Quad erat demonstrandum.\nAs Chorlton expressed it: “History suggests that the snowblitz theory is less than fool-\nproof.”? True enough, the so-called Little Ice Age, which gripped the world in medieval\nroof.”? True enough, the so-called Little Ice Age, which gripped the world in medieval\ntimes, did owe its cause to a series of drastically cold winters and summers. But, not only did\nthis situation last a mere few hundred years, the ensuing frigidity fell drastically short of what\ncould rightly be termed an ice age. North America and Eurasia came nowhere near being\nburied in miles-thick glaciers. Granted, one might argue that just because it did not go all the\nuried in miles-thick glaciers. Granted, one might argue that just because it did not go all the\nway during the Little Ice Age, it does not necessarily mean that a similar situation might not\nhave prolonged itself and thus intensified into a proper ice age. But this, then, would have to\nave prolonged itself and thus intensified into a proper ice age. But this, then, would have to\nhave transpired more than once and, judging by what has been going on climatically since the\nave transpired more than once and, judging by what has been going on climatically since the\nlast Ice Age, the burden of proof, despite the Little Ice Age, remained on Lamb and\nWoodroffe’s shoulders.\nICE AS ITS OWN CAUSE\nIn 1964, Alex Wilson, a glaciologist from New Zealand, reverted to the theory that the\nice ages were caused by the ice itself, but with a slight difference. As Windsor Chorlton ex-\npressed it: “Wilson’s scenario was relatively simple,”? and it amounted to the following.\nStarting with the Antarctic ice sheet, Wilson explained how this grows thicker and thus\nheavier during thousands of years of snow accumulation. The immense pressure exerted on\nthe bottom ice causes it to melt and the water thus formed acts as a lubricant for the entire\ne bottom ice causes it to melt and the water thus formed acts as a lubricant for the entire\nsheet. The motion of the entire Antarctic sheet would then accelerate, and the ice would slip\neet. The motion of the entire Antarctic sheet would then accelerate, and the ice would slip\ninto the surrounding water. As it spread and broke up, the ice would reflect increasing\nnto the surrounding water. As it spread and broke up, the ice would reflect increasing\namount of solar radiation back into space. This would cause a rapid cooling of Earth’s south-\nmount of solar radiation back into space. This would cause a rapid cooling of Earth’s south-\nem hemisphere. Wind and marine currents would then convey this chill northward, which\nm hemisphere. Wind and marine currents would then convey this chill northward, which\nwould radically alter the world’s weather patterns. In its turn, this coldness would cause ice\nsheets to form in the northern hemisphere. Over thousands of years, North America and\neets to form in the northern hemisphere. Over thousands of years, North America and\nEurasia would be buried under ice.+\nThe ice age would then have ended through a reversal of the above mechanism. “The\nmassive outward surge of the colder ice” at the Antarctic would cool the base of the ice sheet,\nthus stopping the melt and depriving the sheet of its lubrication. The ice would stop surging\ninto the sea, floating ice would be diminished, and thus less solar radiation would be re-\nflected back to space. The southern hemisphere would warm up, currents would then warm\nthe northern hemisphere, and the northern ice would begin to melt. The cycle would then re-\npeat itself.5\n2\n2ee@erpged",
