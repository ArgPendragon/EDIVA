The first of these involved a phase change when planetary core temperatures\nand pressures reach a critical point, leading to a volume discontinuity. An Earth-sized planet\nin this condition would then either implode or explode “depending on whether the volume\ndecreases or increases.”? The second possible mechanism he proposed was nuclear fission\ndue to natural fission reactors such as those discovered right here on Earth, and which would\nhave been more energetic in the past.3 And the third concerns the unaccountable blockage of\nheat flow from the continually regenerated gravitational field, which would disrupt the\nplanet’s equilibrium. “The energy excess in the interior of such a planet,” he wrote, “would\nbuild indefinitely until either the insulating layer was breached or the planet blew itself\napart.”4 However, as Van Flandern himself confesses, these are nothing but “theoretical\nconjectures.”5\nWhen it comes to the asteroids, which both Ovenden and Van Flandern saw as the debris\nof their exploded planet, Alfvén and Arrhenius claim that this could not have been the case.\nAs they indicate: “It is also clear from the spin distribution of asteroids that they cannot origi-\nnate by explosion of much bigger bodies.”6\nSo, likewise, when it comes to meteorites: “The accretion, fragmentation and irradiation\nrecord in meteorites clearly does not reflect processes taking place in the ‘regolith’ of a\nplanet-size parent body, miraculously created and later exploded.””\nAlso, if Alfvén and Arrhenius are correct, rather than being the product of exploding\nplanets, short period comets have accreted from meteoroids.®\n“Planetary encounters of long-period meteoroids perturb their orbits into short-\nperiod, predominantly prograde orbits with lower eccentricities. These\nmeteoroids are\nfocused into short-period meteor streams, and short-period comets then accrete\nwithin these streams.”?\nIf this is correct, short-period comets cannot be anywhere as old as Van Flandern calcu-\nlates. “In striking contrast to the long lifetime of short-period meteoroids is the short lifetime\nof short-period comets, which according to observations is only 100-10,000 yr.”!",

Our own scenario, on the other hand, is not necessarily\nencumbered with the origin of comets so that, for the time being, we can leave this topic\naside. But, despite Van Flandern’s own attempts, this would still leave the problem\nconcerning the mechanism that would have caused Ovenden’s and Van Flandern’s planet(s)\nto explode. I am therefore being only partly mischievous when I ask: In view of Ovenden’s\nwavering between a ring and a planet, why not think of a ringed planet?\nHow would this get rid of the problem?\nIt is doubtful that a 90 Earth-mass planet, which is what Ovenden’s original postulate\ncalled for, would have been entirely solid. Nothing that massive exists in a totally rigid state\nin our Solar System. A Saturn-size planet, which is what a 90 Earth-mass planet amounts to,\nwould probably have been akin to Saturn—in other words a gas giant as, indeed, Van\nFlandern himself proposed for some of his exploded planets. And since, despite some earlier\ndisclaimers,} Saturn is still more star-like than planet-like, a nova-like outburst is not only\nfeasible, but so is a recurring one. Thus, in contradistinction to Van Flandern, only one body\nis required. The difference, as we have seen with novae and supernovae, is that gaseous\nbodies can flare up without annihilating themselves, where the emitted material would\nmainly be in gaseous form.\nI am not sure how a recurring proto-Saturnian flare-up would fit Ovenden’s Principle of\nLeast Interaction Action or whether this would satisfy his conclusion that the Solar System is\nstill in the process of recovering from some past catastrophic event. Although it would have\nbeen reduced in mass, unlike Ovenden’s planet Aztex, or Van Flandern’s multiple planets,\nproto-Saturn did not annihilate itself. But with a change of mass to start with and some read-\njustments of orbits, with the addition of tidal friction and electric forces, a new set of calcula-\ntions might yet justify the mytho-historic scenario. And while astronomers are not yet ready\nto admit it, in the end it is history that will carry the day.\n1 [bid., p. 330.\n330\n2«View of Comets as Pristine Relics of Solar System Formation Evolves,” Southwest Research Institute (SwRI)\nNews Release (August 8, 2003).\n3K.

Crew’s main aim for this proposal, however, was driven\nby his desire to account for Immanuel Velikovsky’s hypothesis that the planet Venus was the\nejected core of the planet Jupiter,! with which this work does not concur. Nevertheless, prior\nto his commitment to the Saturn thesis, Wallace Thornhill found much to commend in\nCrew’s particular postulate. According to him, a planet experiencing the processes reasoned\nout by Crew “would undergo a nova phase.”? More importantly, Thornhill was influenced by\nthe electrical intimations of stellar novae which, at a later date, facilitated his acceptance of\nproto-Saturn’s flare-up. As he wrote:\n“There is interesting evidence that a nova is associated with an electric discharge as\nindicated by the broadening of the spectral lines from such an outburst. The broaden-\ning follows the lambda square law of the Zeeman (magnetic) effect and not the\nlambda law of the Doppler effect... Also, several novas have been observed to virtu-\nally extinguish around maximum brightness. This is easily explained by another of\nBruce’s laws which concerns the self-extinction of a discharge at maximum current\ndue to the high pressures generated by it in the discharge channel.”3\nNeedless to say, proto-Saturn was neither a full-fledged star nor yet a gaseous planet. As\nintimated in both this work and our previous one, despite the fine and still controversial line\nof demarcation, we have categorized it as a sub-brown dwarf.

Flares have even\nbeen associated with comets.4 The flare-up of Halley’s comet which occurred between the\norbits of Uranus and Saturn, and so much baffled astronomers, is now a matter of cometary\nhistory.> “One suggestion for the outburst,” noted Thornhill, “was a possible collision with a\nsmall asteroid, but the probability of such an occurrence was put at 2 X 10° or less.”6 What\nis more likely is that, having spent most of its time in the outer regions of the Solar System,\nHalley’s comet had achieved electrical equilibrium, which equilibrium was disrupted once it\nneared the Sun. The electric stress would then have exceeded its breakdown potential.",

It\nshould, however, already be evident that if nova-like flares can be exhibited by bodies as\nmassive as stars and as small as comets, brown dwarf stars should also be able to exhibit\nsimilar phenomena.\nBROWN DWARF OUTBURSTS\nThat brown dwarfs have a tendency to brighten has been known since 1977 when the dark\npartner of the white dwarf known as AM Herculis suddenly flared.? It was, therefore, rather\nsurprising when, 25 years later, astronomers registered astonishment to discover that brown\ndwarfs flare up.\n“Astronomers expected brown dwarfs, like most objects in the universe, to grow steadily\nfainter as they cool. However, new observations showed that during a relatively short\nphase, brown dwarfs appear to get brighter as they cool.”3\nIn 1977, William Liller believed such flares had to do with the exchange of gases between\nthe dark companion and its white dwarf host,4 something that astronomers were to come back\nto by 2003. In 2002, however, Mark Marley attributed such sudden brightening to the brown\ndwarf’s weather:\n“As the brown dwarf cools further, atmospheric weather patterns cause a rapid clearing of\nthe clouds; as the clouds are whisked away by the storms, bright infrared light from the\nhotter atmosphere beneath the clouds escapes, accounting for the unusual brightening of\nthe brown dwarfs.”>\nBut that such flares had nothing to do with the uncovering of the brighter atmosphere by\nthe shifting of the clouds should have been obvious since, as early as 1999, it had been discoy-\nered that brown dwarfs also emit strong X-rays. This came to light through the shedding of\nsuch rays by the brown dwarf known as LP 944-20 in the constellation Fornax. “After nine\nhours of seeing nothing special,” Maia Weinstock reported, “a bright flare of X-rays taunted",

These ra-\ndio emissions “spiked up to 10,000 times stronger than what astronomers thought possible,\nindicating an intense flare of energy that may be similar to flares on the Sun.”\n“In regular stars [Arnold Benz reported], radio and X-ray emissions are related proc-\nesses. Radio waves are created by the interaction of electrons with a star’s magnetic\nforce, which sends magnetic loops out through hot plasma above the surface. [T]hese\nelectrons follow a star’s magnetic field lines down into the cooler surface, where\nthey heat gases and generate X-rays.”3\nAnd yet it is obvious that Benz was not quite happy with his own analogy since he also\nstated that it is possible that “brown dwarfs might emit radio waves via a completely\ndifferent process than normal stars.” And that, at least in part, is because brown dwarfs are\nnot supposed to burn hydrogen the way a “normal” star is supposed to do, although they do\nburn deuterium.> But there is another aspect of LP 944-20 which throws doubt on Benz’s\nanalogy, and that is the fact that it “emits radio waves much more intensely and energetically\nthan would be expected, based on its known X-ray emissions.”6\nKnowing so little about brown dwarfs, even as of this writing, it is doubtful that the\nabove mechanisms are correct in all their details. It does however indicate that radio waves\nand X-ray emissions are intimately tied up with the dwarf stars’ electric, magnetic, and\nplasma environment.\nAs noted, these sudden discharges have been said to be similar to solar flares rather than\nactual nova-like outbursts.

Six of these, all said to be well-known, have been found to flare up\n“every few weeks or months.” As proposed by Liller in 1997, these outbursts are believed to\noccur when the dwarf spills gas into a white dwarf companion. And yet, as always the case\nwith these new discoveries, all of these six dwarf novae staggered astronomers by being\n“more luminous than expected.”!\nGranted that these dwarf novae have been identified as those from red dwarf stars, it\nshould be remembered that brown dwarfs, which can be just as red, are merely the slightly\nless massive siblings of red dwarfs. And if red dwarfs can flare up in nova-like brilliance,\nthen so can brown dwarf stars. More than that, if these six red dwarfs flare up “every few\nweeks or months,” they should be classed as recurring dwarf novae, which is what they\nreally are.\nPLASMA DISCHARGES\nTo repeat what Donald Scott has already told us, plasmas at a distance do not “see” each\nother electrically. What this means is that the Sun’s heliosphere remained electrically\nunaware of the approaching proto-Saturnian system’s plasmasphere. This plasmaspheric in-\nvisibility, however, is not merely electrical. As Hannes Alfvén noted, plasma sheaths or\nbubbles are quite often optically imperceptible. Although they were not immediately\nrecognized as such, Solar System plasmaspheres—like the one around Saturn itself, to say\nnothing of Earth’s—are entirely invisible to the naked eye. What is worse is that even with\ninstrumentation, it is almost impossible to detect them from a distance.* Although invisible,\nnearer ones, like those within our Solar System, have of course been detected and even\nmapped. Their revelation has been made possible through the use of instrument-laden\nspacecraft. But, as Alfvén also tells us: “A spacecraft usually sees [that is, detects] no\nindication of such a sheet until it actually passes through it.”3\n“As it is unlikely that cosmic plasmas have such properties only in those regions\nwhich are accessible to spacecraft diagnostics, it is legitimate to conclude that space\nin general has a ‘cellular structure,’ although this is almost impossible to observe\nunless a spacecraft penetrates the ‘cell walls’ (current sheets). This means that in dis-\ntant regions, we cannot hope to detect the cell walls directly. Nor can we tell the size\nof the cells. It is unpleasant to base far-reaching conclusions on the existence of a\nstructure which we cannot detect directly. But the alternative is to draw far-reaching\nconclusions from the assumption that in distant regions, the plasmas have properties\nwhich are drastically different from what they are in our own neighborhood. This is\nobviously far more unpleasant than our inability to detect distant ‘cell walls.’ Hence,\na thorough revision of our concept of the properties of interstellar (and intergalactic)\nspace is an inevitable consequence of recent magnetospheric discoveries.”+",

This equilibrium can however be unbalanced if the plasma en-\ncounters regions of different electrical potential. As Alfvén noted, “the behavior of the\nplasma depends on the outer circuit.” A stable plasma discharge can become unstable if its\nresistance is decreased. Such an instability can then lead to an extinction of the plasma’s cur-\nrent. Alfvén was right to stress that “every electric circuit is explosive” so that if the current\nis disrupted “‘a release of the whole inductive energy...at the point of disruption will occur.”!\n“Tf the current disruption is caused by an instability in the plasma, the inductive en-\nergy...in the circuit will be released in the plasma. It then causes an explosion which\nmay be violent if [the inductive energy] is large.”\nI hate to be more technical than I need to be, but I am sure the educated reader will be\nable to understand the following explanation as offered by Alfvén:\n“Consider a volume V of space limited by a surface S. The properties of the plasma\ninside of S depend on the boundary conditions. Thus by changing the current\nthrough S, we can change the behavior of the plasma.”\nIn our own scenario, the volume V of space would translate into the volume of the proto-\nSaturnian plasmasphere. The surface S would be its limiting boundary. The change of current\nthrough S was achieved once the proto-Saturnian plasmasphere came in contact with the\nSun’s heliosphere. This occurred because the proto-Saturnian system had penetrated into a\ndifferent, that is higher, electrical environment.\nAdditionally, plasmas can have double sheaths or layers,* and the disruption described\nabove “is often caused by a double layer becoming unstable.” This is because, as in our own\nscenario, “the voltage drop suddenly increases by orders of magnitude.”®\n“There are good reasons to suppose that many of the explosive events observed in\ncosmic physics are produced by exploding double layers [Alfvén tells us]. Examples\nare magnetic substorms, solar flares, and similar phenomena in ‘flare stars’.”7\nMoreover, the violent current surges produced by the explosion of double layers also lead\nto the acceleration of plasma particles, “sometimes as high as cosmic ray energies”’— which\nmight be tied to the generation of X-rays from both novae, supernovae, and brown dwarf\nflares.",

Whether the Sun’s heliosphere extended less far or farther during the era with\nwhich we are concerned must at present remain something of a moot question.\nSince it is also our postulate that the proto-Saturnian system approached the Sun’s\ndomain from beneath the Sun’s equatorial plane, there is actually no way at present to\ndetermine at what distance from the Sun the proto-Saturnian plasmasphere contacted the\nSun’s heliosphere.\nAs we have already noted, the proto-Saturnian system’s speed of entry into the Solar Sys-\ntem would have been slowed down due to its acquisition of a spiraling orbit around the Sun’s\nextended axis of rotation. This speed would have been greater had proto-Saturn been less\nmassive. The more massive an object, the more resistance it will exert on the electro, mag-\nnetic, and/or gravitational force acting upon it. And, to be sure, it has long been known that\n“migration works more slowly on massive planets.”\nIt might be thought that this slow spiraling migration toward the Sun would have brought\nthe proto-Saturnian system in colliding, or near-colliding, proximity to whatever planets were\nalready within the Sun’s domain. This view is exemplified by what we believe to be Allan\nand Delair’s invalid scenario in which the invading body of their hypothesis is posited to\nhave interacted violently with just about every planet in the Solar System.* Of course, their\ninvading body is posited to have entered the Solar System along the Sun’s equatorial plane in\nwhich the present planets orbit. This would seem to make collisions, or at least near contacts,\nbetween the invader and the planets much more likely since its trajectory would have crossed\nthe orbits of the planets. But, as J. G. Hills had shown years earlier, even with an orbit-cross-\ning trajectory, the chances of such an outside invader interacting with just one Solar System\nplanet is close to nil. Or, as Lloyd phrased it:",

Computer simulations have\nshown that a planet as massive as 10 Jupiters would have no discernible effect upon\nthe other planets if it moved among them.”!\nIn our case, with proto-Saturn approaching the Solar system from below, the chances of\nclose contact with whatever planets might have already been dependent on the Sun becomes\neven less likely. Fair enough, violent planetary interaction is more than mildly intimated in\nancient texts, but none of these cosmic catastrophes are anywhere placed in relation to proto-\nSaturn’s flare-up or the ensuing series of events which went down in myth as the Creation. It\nis thus evident that whatever convulsion was experienced by proto-Saturn in its flare-up, it\nwas not shared by those planets which were already in the Sun’s retinue. As Lloyd also sur-\nmised, in the event that a brown dwarf was to invade the Sun’s family of planets, “life would\ngo on in the solar system as if nothing had ever happened.”? Needless to say, because of its\nclose proximity to proto-Saturn, this would not necessarily have applied to Earth and its in-\nhabitants. But we will come to that later.\nIf our scenario is anywhere near being correct, the planet Saturn, as it exists now, must\nsurely retain some signs of its previous flare-up. Apart from Velikovsky, S. K.\nVsekhsvyatskii, who was then the Director of the Kiev Observatory, had also posited that\nSaturn had erupted in a great outburst. He claimed that something like 10% grams of its\nmaterial was blown off into space? Although, as in Velikovsky’s case, we might not entirely\nagree with the full details Vsekhsvyatskii deduced re the mechanism responsible for the\neruption, we are of one mind with him when he states that “the present state of Saturn is the\nresult of a relatively recent and especially high flare-up in eruptive activity on the planet.”4\nThe “present state of Saturn” includes the cloud of electrified gas or plasma which\nVoyager 2 discovered circling the planet. Scientists actually “expected things to get very cold\nfor Voyager 2 as it sailed toward Saturn, nearly a billion miles from the Sun.” Instead, they\nfound this doughnut-shaped cloud, the temperature of which has been estimated to range\n“from 60 million degrees Fahrenheit to more than 1,000 million degrees, 300 times hotter than\nthe Sun’s outer regions and the hottest spot ever detected in the Solar System.”® Others have\nclaimed that the cloud is only “approximately 300 million degrees Fahrenheit,” but, strangely\nenough, “about 50,000 times hotter than the Sun’s surface.”” Go figure.",
