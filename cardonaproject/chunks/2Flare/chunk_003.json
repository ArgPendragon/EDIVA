Unfortunately, meanwhile,\nwhile considering continental drift, Velikovsky discounted it because, at the time, no valid\ncause for the drifting of continents had yet been found. As he himself pointed out, when the\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science met for its annual convention in August\nof 1950 to debate the case, the balance was not tipped in favor of drift.\n“There were many defenders of the theory and as many opponents. The theory was\nthen put to a vote. The result was an even division between ‘yea’ and ‘nay.’ The\nchairman was entitled to cast the deciding vote but abstained. Only through the for-\ntuitous circumstance that the presiding officer was a conscientious—or undecided—\nperson was the sanctification of continental drift averted.”!\nBut not for long. And, ironically, it was one of Velikovsky’s own encouragers (although\nnot necessarily a supporter) who, in the 1960s, finally came up with the mechanism respon-\nsible for continental drift, now better known as plate tectonics. But what did continental drift\nhave to do with the apparent ambiguities of the Permian ice age?\nAs Warren Hamilton and David Krinsley first revealed, the answer lies in the congrega-\ntion of the continents as they existed during the Permian. During this time, South America,\nAfrica, India, Antarctica, and Australia were all bunched together in a single continental\nmass. This continental block—sometimes referred to as Gondwana, sometimes as Pangaea,\nalthough Pangaea is sometimes considered to have been the larger landmass resulting from\nthe collision of Laurasia and Gondwana?—was at the time concentrated at the terrestrial\nsouth pole. The Permian ice did not therefore glaciate the tropics and equatorial areas. It gla-\nciated the south polar regions. And the ice did not creep in a reversed direction. It crept from\nthe south pole toward the northern latitudes as it should have done. It is only because this\ncontinental land mass split and drifted to the north that we now find the signs of this glacial\nepoch spread across the equator with the evidence of striation pointing in what appears to be\nthe wrong direction.3\nSNOWBALL EARTH\nA more recently-postulated glacial event is said to have occurred during the Neoprotero-\nzoic, dated to approximately 600 million years before the present, just ahead of the appear-\nance of recognizable animal life. As Paul Hoffman and Daniel Schrag tell us:\n“Thick layers of ancient rock hold the only clues to the climate of the Neoproterozoic.\nFor decades, many of those clues appeared rife with contradiction. The first paradox\nwas the occurrence of glacial debris near sea level in the tropics.”+",

        "content": "Would not the answer lie in the congregation of the continental plates around the south pole?\nNot according to Harland, Hoffman, and Schrag.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Harland came to the conclusion that, during the Neoproterozoic, the\ncontinents had clustered near the equator rather than at the south pole as envisioned by Ham-\nilton and Krinsley. Harland based his conjecture on the magnetic orientation of the mineral\ngrains in the glacial detritus of the Neoproterozoic. These grains would have aligned them-\nselves with Earth’s magnetic field before the detritus hardened into rock. The magnetic dip of\nthese grains was only slight relative to the horizontal, which indicates a formative position\nnear the equator. Had these grains formed anywhere near the poles, their magnetic orienta-\ntion would have been close to vertical.!\n\nIn disagreement with Hamilton and Krinsley (whom they do not even mention), Hoffman\nand Schrag believe that the breakup of the continents from this single landmass occurred 770\nmillion years ago.? Glaciation in Neoproterozoic strata on all continents which were already\nin separate blocks and strewn across the equator led them to the conclusion that the entire\nEarth must have frozen over—a theory now referred to as Snowball Earth, a term coined in\n1992 by the geobiologist Joseph Kirschvink.? Nor did it happen just once. “As improbable as\nit may sound,” wrote Hoffman and Schrag, “we see clear evidence that this striking climate\nreversal—the most extreme imaginable on this planet—happened as many as four times\nbetween 750 million and 580 million years ago.”+\n\nAccording to Schrag, the ancient Earth had originally been kept warm by methane leak-\ning slowly into the atmosphere when deposits within the seafloor somehow destabilized. This\nincreased the levels of carbon dioxide. “The trouble with the planet’s dependence on meth-\nane,” Sarah Simpson explains, “is that the gas disappears quickly in an oxygen-rich atmos-\nphere.” Thus an interruption in the methane leak would have left Earth “in dire need of\ngreenhouse gases.” The result was that Earth’s climate “tumbled” into these deep freezes.>\nAs Simpson sought to explain: “The planet’s only solution to the deep freeze was to wait for\nvolcanoes to release enough heat-trapping carbon dioxide to create a runaway greenhouse\neffect.” Thus a “brutal episode of warming ensued” which not only melted the ice but also\nended up “baking the planet.”6\n\nFirst presented in the journal Science in mid 1998, the theory garnered cautious support\nin the scientific community. Even so, Schrag himself had to acknowledge that his scenario\nstrained credulity. “I’m not sure I totally buy this idea—it’s outrageous,” he admitted at the\nend of his presentation on the subject at a conference held in Edinburgh in June of 2001. “But\nit’s the only idea that explains the carbon isotope crash just before the glaciations.””",

When, not long after, the theoretical physicist\nGino Segré presented the concept to his readers,? he was honest enough to admit that the\ntheory was “not universally accepted,” that it “may not be entirely right,”> and that “there are\nloose ends.”* Yet, despite all that, he was confident enough to believe that the concept “holds\ntogether remarkably well” and that it was “moving toward acceptance,”®\nAs to how life could have survived such a complete world-wide freezing, Segré informs\nus that:\n“In a deep freeze, life could have continued on isolated underwater hydrothermal\nvents while it died on the surface...As the Earth thawed, surface life returned, gener-\nated in new and more varied forms, soon to multiply in astounding profusion. Perhaps\nthe deep freeze was even a trigger of sorts for that spurt.””\nAn addition to the theory was proposed by Philip Allen and Paul Hoffman who then\nhailed respectively from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Harvard University.\nAccording to these two, when Earth was emerging out of its Snowball condition, it was buf-\nfeted by violent global storms caused by the immense temperature differences between the\nshrinking ice and the growing oceans around the equator. Evidence of these storms, including\nmassive waves, was reported to have been discovered in ripples preserved in sedimentary\nrocks dated to 635 million years ago. This evidence was reported to have been discovered in\nthe very same localities that Hoffman and Schrag had earlier discovered glaciation scars—\nAustralia, Namibia, Brazil, Canada, and Svalbard in the Arctic Ocean. “The monster swells\nwhipped up by persistent winds must have been 7 to 12 metres high.”8\nIn 2005, Snowball Earth was still short of confirmation? Worse still, the discovery of a\nphotosynthetic community of algae in rocks from the period concerned has undermined the\ntheory!° since it is inconceivable that such life, lowly as it might be considered by some,\ncould have survived beneath the miles-thick glaciers which, under this scheme, would have\ncovered Earth’s entire continents.\nAs of this writing, that is where the matter rests.",

Be-\nsides affecting a slow successive change of pole stars, this motion also alters the length of the\nseasons since it changes the time of year during which Earth is nearest and/or farthest from\nthe Sun. Thus, for instance, something like 11,000 years ago, the precessional cycle had\nlengthened the winters in the northern hemisphere while shortening those in the southern.\nAdhémar thus suggested that “whichever hemisphere had a longer winter would experi-\nence an ice age, so that every 11,000 years glacial conditions would occur in either the\nNorthern or Southern Hemisphere.”!\nBut as the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt noted in 1852, the decrease in so-\nlar radiation received by a hemisphere while tilted away from the Sun is balanced by the\nsame amount of increased radiation during the opposite season when the tilt is toward the\nSun.? Thus, in the course of a single year, both hemispheres receive about the same amount\nof solar energy.\nIn 1864, James Croll, basing his ideas on the work of the French astronomer Urbain Jean\nJoseph Leverrier, came up with a new theory. Leverrier had by then discovered that Earth’s\norbital path around the Sun also changes over time. According to Leverrier’s calculations,\nEarth’s orbit varies over a period of some 100,000 years from the ellipse it now is to a nearly\nperfect circle and back again. Croll thus decided that the ice ages had been caused by these\norbital changes. His reasoning was that the diminishing of sunlight in winter would encour-\nage the accumulation of snow. This, in turn, would reinforce the seasonal cooling since fur-\nther solar radiation would be reflected back by the aggregation of the snow. From this he de-\ntermined that precession and the degree of orbital eccentricity were the major factors gov-\nerning the amount of sunlight received by Earth in its winter months.3\nIn 1873, Alfred Wilks Drayson published the hypothesis that ice ages had been caused by\na tilt of Earth’s axis from the present 23.5° to one of about 35° and back again in a 30,000\nyear cycle. As he reasoned, winters would have been much colder and summers much hotter,\nS nowball earth aside, what caused the ice ages?",

For this, Croll was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society\nin London, chosen as an honorary member of the New York Academy of Science, presented\nwith an honorary doctoral degree by the University of St. Andrews, and granted funds to\ncontinue his research by the Geological Society of London.\n\nBut then disaster struck. Basing his calculations on the above mentioned astronomical pa-\nrameters, Croll had determined that the last ice age would have peaked about 80,000 years\nago. But continuing studies of the geological strata in Europe and North America soon made\nit clear that the glacial conditions of the last ice age had persisted until a much more recent\ntime. “By the time of Croll’s death in 1890, most geologists were beginning to believe that\nhis theory must be wrong.”\n\nThe astronomical theory of ice ages was next picked up by Milutin Milankovitch who\nwas born in 1879 in what was then Serbia, now Yugoslavia. It was in 1911 that he decided to\ndevelop a mathematical theory which he hoped would allow him to determine Earth’s tem-\nperature at different latitudes as well as the climates of the other Solar System planets. A\nthorough survey of work done in this field by others before him soon brought him to Croll’s\nendeavors as well as Ludwig Pilgrim’s 1904 calculations of the precession of the equinoxes\nand the changes inherent in Earth’s orbital eccentricity and the angle of its axial tilt. Pilgrim\nhimself had even charted the relationship between Earth’s orbital eccentricity and the ice\nages. Milankovitch soon realized, however, that Croll had lacked the precise data necessary\nfor his work and that Pilgrim’s knowledge of climatology was likewise inadequate. Even so,\nMilankovitch could find no fault with Pilgrim’s mathematics which he adopted for his own\ncalculations.\n\nIt was not long before Milankovitch announced to the world that, much like Adhémar,\nCroll, and Pilgrim had suspected, the periodic advance and retreat of glacial ice could indeed\nbe caused by changes in solar radiation due to a combination of precession, Earth’s orbital\neccentricity, and variations in Earth’s angle of tilt. Contrary to Croll’s belief that the domi-\nnant factor behind ice ages was the reduction of solar radiation at Earth’s poles during the\nwinter, Milankovitch concluded that the decisive factor lay in the reduction of heat in tem-\nperate latitudes during the summer. The mathematical curves he drew, showing how summer\nheat in the middle latitudes had varied during the past 600,000 years, impressed the German\nclimatologist Wladimir K6ppen who was struck by the correspondence between these curves\nand the sequence of European glaciations that had been established by Eduard Briickner and\nAlbrecht Penck.",

        "content": "\nEventually, the very nature of the theory itself came under attack. Writing in The Irish\nAstronomical Journal in 1952, E. J. Opik rendered his verdict of the Milankovitch theory as\nbeing “unfortunately unsound” since “it amounts to making small causes responsible for con-\nsequences, large out of any proportion to the causes.”! And, with the theory’s untrustwor-\nthiness, the chronology of the Quaternary glaciation also came under attack. “In brief,” wrote\nOpik, “the ‘astronomical’ chronology of the ice ages must be stamped as illusory and re-\njected en bloc...”? He then continued with:\n“Here it will suffice to mention one eloquent fact. The only definite dating of a glacial\nperiod [up to 1952] is that of the Mankato (Wisconsin) forest, which was overcome\nby an advancing glacier of the last glaciation; the radiocarbon method...indicates that\nthis happened 11,000 years ago; yet the ‘astronomical’ theory assigns to that date a\nwarm period, whereas the glaciation, according to the theory, should have happened\nmuch earlier. Thus, in the first test, the ‘astronomical’ theory fails completely.”\nNone of these obstacles swayed Milankovitch who continued to believe in the correctness\nof his theory up until his death in 1958.\nSo did his defenders.4\nTHE DISTRESSED LIFE OF THE MILANKOVITCH THEORY\nWhen it comes to the predicted sequence of ice ages, the Milankovitch theory re-\nmained at variance with geological evidence.5 As Nigel Calder phrased it: “All along, [the\ntheory] had the supreme attraction of an undeniable cause in search of an effect.” But then\ncame the team of James Hays, John Imbrie, and Nicholas Shackleton. As they reported in\n1976, these three individuals tested the Milankovitch theory through the analysis of deep\nocean cores drilled out of the seabed about a thousand kilometers northeast of Kerguelen Is-\nland in the southern Indian Ocean.? While thousands of such cores were available to them,\nHays and company could not even find one that would have been adequate for their purposes.\nThey thus ended up by constructing a composite from two cores, each of which came from\ncollections at different universities, “neither of which,” as Lynn Rose was later to report,\n“was adequate in itself.”* One of them was even damaged, with the Holocene section miss-",
