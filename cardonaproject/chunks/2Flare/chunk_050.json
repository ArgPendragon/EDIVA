In this respect, however, we are no better or worse\noff than mainstream anthropologists.\nOn the other hand, while it is generally believed that we moderns are descended from the\nCro-Magnons, it can safely be stated that the Cro-Magnon culture failed to make the transi-\ntion. This is especially evidenced by the fact that Cro-Magnon artistry completely\ndisappeared at the end of the Pleistocene to be replaced by Mesolithic naiveté that continued\ninto the Neolithic. What happened to those artists whose sophisticated and anatomically cor-\nrect renditions once filled the caves of Europe? Is it likely that the artists were the only ones\nto succumb, and all of them at that?\nOne may well ask why were so many faunal species exterminated while others survived\ninto the modern world? Or why did the Arctic mammoth live on, only to be eradicated by the\nnext cosmic catastrophe?! One can only claim that this was simply due to the vagaries of\nnature, especially when, as in our case, nature tends to go wild.\nRACIAL DIVERGENCE\nAs in the animal kingdom, radiation would also have caused mutations among humans.\nAt present, it is our atmosphere that protects us from primary cosmic rays. John Hagen\nadditionally tells us that:\n“Tt has been estimated that an increase by a factor of ten over the intensity of cosmic\nrays at sea level may affect humans by causing serious mutations in succeeding gen-\nerations. The intensity of cosmic radiation outside the atmosphere may well reach\nthis level and the particles are heavier.”\nHow much more so would cosmic radiation have affected humans through the flare-up of\na sub-brown dwarf star at close proximity?\nDespite what appears to be nothing but the fantasy of an ancient mind, that fragment of\nthe work of Berossus preserved by Alexander Polyhistor we have touched upon above does\nnot merely speak of “monstrous animals” but also treats of what appear to be human\nmutations. After describing that time “in which there was nothing but darkness and an abyss\nof waters,” he goes on with:\n“Men appeared with two wings, some with four and with two faces. They had one\nbody but two heads; the one of a man, the other of a woman. They were likewise in\ntheir several organs both male and female. Other human figures were to be seen with\nthe legs and horns of goats. Some had horses’ feet; others had the limbs of a horse\nbehind, but before were fashioned like men...men too and other animals, with the\nheads and bodies of horses and the tails of fishes.”4",

        "content": "Not only is this description too fantastic to be believed, it also seems that Berossus might\nhave been influenced by the depiction of mythological creatures he would have seen in\nBabylon, mistaking them for the former appearance of flesh and blood monstrosities that\ncould have populated an earlier era. This is evidenced through his own admission when he\nadds that: “Of all these were preserved delineations in the temple of Belus at Babylon.”! And\nyet one cannot help wondering whether these depictions in stone might not have been\nconfused by Berossus with a somewhat similar description of mutated humanity in some long\nlost Babylonian tradition.\n\nIn turn this brings to mind a modern report which appeared in the British newspaper, the\nDaily Telegraph, which claimed that quite a few infants born within a large radius of the pre-\nviously mentioned Chernobyl! disaster have been prone to birth defects including short wing-\nlike arms and/or a lower extremity which has been compared to a fish tail.2 We note here two\nof the characteristics described by Berossus—men with two wings and others with “the tails\nof fishes.” Additionally, men or women with “one body but two heads” are now known as\nSiamese twins. The curse of the club foot is also known and these would have been easily\ncompared to goats’ and horses’ feet. To be sure, I will not vouch for the reliability of the\nDaily Telegraph report since research has led me to believe that no such radioactive mutants\nhave resulted from the fall-out of the Chernoby! disaster. But even if the report was mistaken,\ndeformed arms that look like miniature wings and deformed legs that, together, take on the\nform of an enlarged fish’s tail are not unknown among human birth defects. Thus,\nremembering the time in which it was written, the description by Berossus is not really all\nthat far-fetched. Much stranger creatures have exhibited themselves in side “freak” shows in\ncircuses and fairs throughout the world in the recent past.\n\nLess dramatic was the Jewish historian Josephus who spoke of nature “which, at certain\nrevolutions of time, produces such mutations in the bodies of men, in the earth, in plants, and\nin all things that grow out of the earth.”3\n\nSimilarly, in the New World we meet the Tupinambas of Brazil whose creator, known as\nMonan, is often confused with the somewhat lesser deity Maire-Monan. Unfortunately this\nconfusion disallows us from telling which deity was responsible for what follows even\nthough it is presently attributed to Maire-Monan. It is said of this deity that, close to the time\nof Creation, he had “the power of changing men and animals into other forms.”5\n\nTogether with the previous snippet from Ovid, the totality of these reports, garbled as\nthey may be, tend to make us believe that they are based on ancient traditions concerning the\nappearance of mutations which, in a reduced humanity, would have stuck out like the\nproverbial sore thumb.\n\nWhy were these mutations not passed on?

Although in some cases, espe-\ncially among human giants, life spans might be shortened, these mutants, as well known, do\nmate and breed but they give birth to normal children. As in the animal kingdom, it therefore\nbecomes obvious that most of the mutated human individuals who survived proto-Saturn’s\nflare-up failed to pass their mutated genes to their offspring so that, in a very short time, they\nwould have disappeared completely.\nAt the end of an article dealing with mutation and evolution, James Crow concludes that,\n“the effects produced by mutations are of all sorts, and are mostly harmful.”! As he goes on:\n“Some [mutations] cause embryonic death, some severe disease, some physical ab-\nnormalities, and probably many more cause minor impairments of body function that\nbring an increased susceptibility to the various vicissitudes of life. Some have an im-\nmediate effect; others lie hidden to cause their harm many generations later. All in\nall, mutations must be responsible for a substantial fraction of human premature\ndeath, illness and misery in general.”?\nBear in mind, however, that while Caucasian dwarfs and midgets tend to give birth to\nnormal offspring, African Pygmies give birth to pygmy children.\nThat mutations can be inherited is well known, where such mutations are passed on from\nmother to child. Thus, for instance, numerous members of a Rhodesian tribe have feet with\nonly two toes that have been compared to the feet of an ostrich or the claws of a lobster. The\ndefect is a hereditary condition, possibly via a single mutated gene. In this particular case, the\ndeformity has been traced to a woman in the Zambesi valley. A relative of hers is known to\nhave settled near Botswana and her two-toed descendants now number in the hundreds.?\nA better known case among African people is the development of steatopygia, a very\nconspicuous characteristic what occurs mainly among Bushmen and Hottentots. This consists\nof a fatty accumulation on the thighs and buttocks and is believed to serve as “food store for\nthe body during periods of droughts.” But, as Josef Wolf notes, “ancient cave paintings show\nwomen with steatopygia at times when the Khoisan [Bushmen and Hottentots] were living in\nrelatively fertile, well-watered territory, so this argument may not be altogether correct.”\nWolf adds that: “The fact that the condition is much admired by the men indicates that sexual\nselection may also have played a part in preserving this interesting characteristic.”4 This\nmight be so, but it does not explain how “this interesting characteristic” originated.\nMore importantly, however, is the question concerning the origins of the Negroes and the\nPygmies of the African continent. The derivation of man’s racial variety has been debated for\nmany years. What is conceded by all parties is that “the remarkable diversity in our species\ntoday has its roots in the changing and sometimes harsh conditions of the last ice age.”> This\nconsensus has been reached because the fossil record of modern-like humans does not stretch",

But, as James Strickling as-\ntutely asked, “where...did the dark-skinned people of Africa come from?! Quoting C. S.\nCoon, Strickling stresses that the “origin of the African Negroes, and of the Pygmies, is the\ngreatest unsolved mystery of racial study.”\n“Wherever any of these people originated, the accepted time scale of their color dif-\nferences fits comfortably within the framework of uniformitarianism. We are assured\nthat the ‘differentiation of white, yellow and black races took place over a period of\n293\nhalf a million years by mutation’ .”3\nhalf a million years by mutation’.\nBut here’s the rub: “Surprisingly enough, in Africa, the continent which is considered by\nsome to be the cradle of human evolution and which has been populated (though on a very\nrestricted scale) by members of the genus Homo for over three million years, the origins and\ndistribution of peoples of modern type are very largely obscure.” In discussing the African\nPygmies, Colin Turnbull had this to say: “The BaMbuti, as the Pygmies of the Ituri Forest are\nknown to themselves and to their neighbors, may be the original inhabitants of the great\nstretch of rain forest that reaches from the Atlantic coast right across Central Africa to the\nopen grassland country on the far side of the chain of great lakes that divides the Congo from\nEast Africa.”5 Moreover: “Their origin, along with that of Negrito peoples [that is, Asiatic\nPygmies] elsewhere in the world, is lost in the prehistoric past.”6 As Coon writes: “As far as\nwe know, the Congoid line started on the same evolutionary level as the Eurasiatic ones in\nthe Early Middle Pleistocene and then stood still for a half million years, after which Negroes\nand Pygmies appeared as if out of nowhere.” Furthermore, they did so in the Upper Pleisto-\ncene® or, in other words, at the end of the Ice Age. Later studies did not change the picture.\n“Tt is not until much later in the fossil record, about the beginning of the Neolithic period\nsome 10,000 years ago,” writes Wolf, “that recognizably ‘modern’ Africans can be identified\nfrom the skeletal remains.”? And: “It is not until a time-level of about 10,000 years ago that\nskulls with a definite Negro appearance occur in the fossil record.”!°\nThe absence of earlier Negro fossils has often been blamed on the humid environment of\nWest Africa which is “traditionally viewed” as the Negro homeland, and “which is not",

But is it a coincidence that the oldest discovered Negro and Pygmy\nskeletal remains happen to be dated to our benchmark figure of 10,000 years ago?\n\nTo be sure, evidence of a greater antiquity for the Ituri Forest Pygmies has been based\n“on the discovery of stone implements, the oldest of which are dated to about 20,000 years\nago.”3 This, however, tells us nothing about the stature of the people who used these im-\nplements, even if they were the ancestors of the Ituri Pygmies.\n\nAm I claiming that the African Negroes and Pygmies originated as the result of sudden\nmutation incurred through proto-Saturn’s flare-up? Let me just say that the hypothesis is\nworthy of consideration. Actually, however, race is more a case of genetic recombination\nthan outright genetic mutation. But, in our case, this will be found to make little difference.\n\nIn the meantime let no one suppose that the Pygmies and Negroes of Africa, together\nwith their North American descendants, are mentally, or otherwise, inferior to any other race.\nIn the end, regardless of race, we are all descended from mutants.\n\nBURPING METHANE\n\nIn the search for the most viable theory of past extinctions, Gregory Ryskin has recently\ncome up with a new hypothesis. As summarized by Susan Kruglinski:\n\n“Ryskin proposes that huge deposits of methane and other gases, which are naturally\nproduced in deep-sea waters, became trapped under the pressure of a then-stagnant\nglobal ocean. Any forceful disturbance—an earthquake or a volcanic eruption, for\ninstance—could have disrupted the pressurized gas. Rising methane could have\nchurned the ocean, suffocating aquatic organisms, and flooded into the atmosphere,\ntriggering a worldwide hot spell. A single lightning stroke could even have set the\nwhole planet aflame.”+\n\nRyskin meant this scenario to apply to the great extinction of the Permian which “wiped\nout virtually all marine species and most life on land.” Gregory Retallack, on the other hand,\nthought this explanation rather dubious because he couldn’t see how that much methane\ncould be stored underwater. But, as Ryskin pointed out, “minor gas belches still create\nhazards in lakes and coastal areas.” Moreover, the same thing, if on a somewhat smaller scale\nthan that envisaged by Ryskin, was later found to have transpired at the end of the\nPleistocene. But where does oceanic methane came from?\n\nIt has now been ascertained that “nearly a third of all the life on this planet consists of mi-\ncrobes living under the seafloor in a dark world without oxygen.”5 What was originally\nthought to be mud hoisted from the bottom of the Black Sea in the summer of 2001 turned",

About one ton of biological material was hauled up and it turned out\nto be “a cubic meter of bacteria.” Diving into the area a few days later in the German\nsubmarine Jago revealed curtains of rising bubbles through a flood-lit fog of floating\nparticles. Nor were these bubbles being released through hot vents. They came, instead, from\nnon-volcanic chimneys that were as soft as flesh. Knocking one over by one of the\nsubmarine’s hydraulic arms, it was discovered that the chimney had been constructed by\nsingle-celled microbes. “The microbes formed the outer layers; the hard core was a carbonate\nmineral they had secreted.”! It is these microbes which are now known to manufacture\nmethane.\n“The evidence is now clear that far below the sea, and far below the floor of the sea,\nin sediments all over the world, microbes live to astonishing depths...and in aston-\nishing numbers. The deepest of the microbes make methane, which the ones in shal-\nlower sediments consume. To all of them, oxygen is poison.”\nThe total amount of methane produced by these organisms has been estimated to be\n“greater than the mass of all known reserves of coal, gas, and oil.” Moreover, methane is a\npotent greenhouse gas. It has even been theorized that the release of this microbial methane\nmay have aided in pulling Earth out of recent ice ages by radically changing the climate.\nMore than that, sudden blasts of this methane have been linked to undersea landslides that\nwould have caused ocean-crossing tsunamis and even mass extinctions.\nThe scar left behind by one these massive landslides occurs off the coast of Norway in\nthe form of a 1,000-foot high cliff at the edge of the continental shelf. The floor of the ocean\nat this point has been dated to have dropped about 8,200 years ago. The landslide that caused\nit “was one of the greatest in Earth’s history.”4 The magnitude of this slide was reported by\nKunzig on the authority of Jiirgen Mienert:\n“Blocks of mud perhaps 20 miles long, a couple of miles wide, and 150 feet high\nrushed down the slope. More than 1,000 cubic miles of sediment and rock shifted.\nThe slide ran out 500 miles to the northwest, north of Iceland, where it met the Mid-\nAtlantic Ridge and was diverted south. Over an area of 35,000 square miles, the\nwhole ocean was as muddy as the Mississippi after a storm, and the seafloor was\nwiped clean of whatever lived there.”’>\nwiped clean of whatever lived there.”5\nMoreover, as Mienert has deduced, the slide occurred “in a very short time...perhaps in a\nfew weeks, perhaps a few days, perhaps a couple of hours.”6\n“The disturbance propagated a tsunami that flooded coastal areas as far away as\nScotland. Along the coasts of Scotland and Norway, the wave ranged between 20",

It may have crested at 65 feet as it roared up narrow Norwegian\nfjords.”!\nAs Kunzig cautions: “To say that the cataclysm was caused by deep-living microbes\nwould be excessive —but their methane may have had a lot to do with it.” There are cracks in\nthe seafloor about 3 miles wide and 50 feet deep just north of the slide. They are dotted with\nwhat Mienert calls pockmarks. And that is where the methane escaped. Mienert himself\nblames all of this on the melting of the Pleistocene ice when Atlantic water flowed in and\nwarmed the bottom.? But, in our own scenario, it is just as probable that the slide—and vari-\nous others around the world which have not yet been recognized —were caused by the tempo-\nrary slowing down of Earth’s rotation due to proto-Saturn’s flare-up. Such sea bottom cracks\nand pockmarks have also been discovered at the edge of the continental shelf near Cape Hat-\nteras. In fact, pockmarks “are turning out to be extremely common, especially in the Arctic”\nand Mienert “has seen fields of them in the Barents Sea.”? That these pockmarks could not be\nextremely old is evidenced by the fact that they have not yet been filled by sediment washing\ndown to the sea from inland rivers. Thus, as Kunzig rightly surmises, these pockmarks “date\nfrom the last ice age.” The only problem with all this is that, as surmised by the marine\ngeologist James Kennett, bursts of methane from the seafloor would have been largely\nresponsible for “virtually all the warmings the planet has experienced over the last 800,000\nyears.”4 As always, once a cause is found to account for an event, it tends to end up being the\nevent’s one and only explanation in the minds of those involved with that particular theory.\nNot only that, but, as always with any new theory, this one, too, found its detractors. Thus\nGerald Dickens was of the opinion that the chances of deep-sea methane actually making it\nto the surface is zero. But blocks of hydrate floating on the surface as well as gas bubbles\nrising to the top have been witnessed off the coast of Oregon and the Gulf of Mexico. Even\nso, Dickens continued to claim that “no one has shown that quantities of methane large\nenough to change the climate would reach the atmosphere.”> Our own stand, of course, is\nsomewhere in between. No, we do not accept that the escape of oceanic bacterial methane\nwould have been enough to change the climate or cause extinctions at the end of the\nPleistocene. But, coupled with all that we have enumerated and described above, it would, if\nnothing else, have added to the sudden steep incline in temperature.\nHEAVEN ON EARTH\nWe end this part of our work on the same subject with which we started, namely, the heat\nwave that followed on the heels of proto-Saturn’s flare-up. Here we will add that, although\nthe flare-up ebbed in time, it continued to produce enough heat to raise temperatures world-",

As we have already seen, the memory of this heat wave was actually preserved, even if\nonly by a few of our ancient forebears. But is there evidence of this change?\n\nAs previously noted, it has now been theorized that radiation from a nearby supernova\nabout 12,500 years ago would not only have reset Earth’s radiocarbon clocks, it would also\nhave caused “various catastrophic phenomena such as heating the atmosphere, melting ice\nsheets and causing extinctions.”! Given their astronomical distances, however, one really\nwonders if supernovae could actually cause such direct repercussions on Earth, despite the\n“nearby” tag attached to the one discussed above. It seems more likely that if Earth’s dire\nconsequences at the end of the Pleistocene requires it to have been bathed in stellar radiation,\nthe source would have had to be much closer than a “nearby” supernova. The only inch I'll\ngive is that the stellar flare responsible would not by astronomical standards be considered\n“super.” After all, as already noted, non-dwarf stars are not the only astronomical luminaries\nthat have a propensity for flaring up in nova-like brilliance. Even comets do—and they do so\nthrough a similar, if not identical, mechanism—by throwing off shells of matter. Some of\nthem even do so repeatedly. Such, for instance, was the case with comet Schwassmann-\nWachmann 1, which has been observed to throw off such shells more than once, each time\nincreasing its brightness by at least a hundred-fold.? Such cometary flare-ups are not known\nto cause any catastrophic effects on Earth. While “nearby” supernovae remain too far,\n“nearby” comets are much too frail. Even flares from “nearby” brown dwarf stars would fail\nto do the job—unless by “nearby” we mean exactly that.\n\nIt has long been assumed that the disappearance of the glaciers was due to the warming\nup of climate. As far as Ernst Opik, as well as others, was concerned, this was due to a rise in\nthe Sun’s own generative power. As he surmised: “In the end we always come back to the\nsimplest and most plausible hypothesis: that our solar furnace varies in its output of heat.”?\nHowever, he himself cautioned that the “peculiar pattern” of alternating freezes and warm\nclimate “cannot be accounted for by any simple scheme of alternate waxing and waning of\nthe sun.”4 And yet he could not help coming back to his “simplest and most plausible\nhypothesis.” Thus, despite his cautionary tone, he found it worth repeating that: “A world-\nwide fall or rise of temperature indicates a change in the heat output by the sun; it is hard to\nexplain in any other way.”> He therefore had to come up with a novel theory concerning the\nmanner in which the Sun behaves.° It is not a theory that has won many adherents.\n\nIn our own scenario, proto-Saturn’s flare-up would have released a certain amount of its\ninternal heat, which heat would have radiated onto Earth, in addition to the heat released\nthrough the friction of the sliding plates brought about by the temporary braking of our globe,",

        "content": "to say nothing of that expelled through world-wide volcanic vents. It is this combined heat—\nyes, even including burping methane—that was mainly responsible for the melting of the\nPleistocene glaciers.\n\nAs we have also seen, the most recent complete and durable geomagnetic reversal oc-\ncurred around 10,000 years ago. It therefore comes as no surprise that geomagnetic reversals\nhave been tied to past climatic changes. When Earth’s magnetic field weakens, Goesta\nWollin has shown, a general warming of the climate follows. Fluctuations in climate, it has\nbeen found out, correspond with geomagnetic reversals.! It is not, however, that geomagnetic\nreversals have themselves caused a lowering or rise in temperature, but that climatic changes\nand geomagnetic reversals have coincided because they were the outcome of one and the\nsame occurrence. This is evidenced by the fact that the geomagnetic reversal associated with\nthe end of the Pleistocene was also accompanied by earthquakes, volcanism, fluctuations in\nEarth’s water table, and faunal extinctions.? It is not conceivable that all these drastic events\nwould have been caused by a geomagnetic reversal or excursion. What the evidence really\ncalls for is that all these occurrences were concurring events resulting from the same single\ncause.\n\nEvidence of a rapid change in climate at the end of the Pleistocene has now been discov-\nered in quantum sufficit. Doug Harkness of the Natural Environment Research Council has\nproduced such evidence. Speaking for the climate of Scotland, he has found that, at the end\nof the last glaciation, the climate changed from Arctic-like to one similar to that of the\npresent day. Moreover, Harkness was adamant in stating that this change happened\n“remarkably rapidly” within a period of 100 to 200 years.3\n\nBut even this period of 100 to 200 years has been repudiated by electrical conductivity\nmeasurements on Greenland ice cores. This has shown that, in the late Pleistocene, Earth’s\nclimatic system “consistently and frequently” changed “between glacial and near-interglacial\nconditions in periods of less than a decade, and on occasion as quickly as three years.”4\nFrom this one may suspect that, since the evidence comes from Greenland, these sudden cli-\nmatic shifts would only have affected Arctic and near-Arctic latitudes. But confirmation that\nthis sudden climatic shift at the end of the Ice Age was global in extent came from the study\nof a dry lake bed in New Mexico.> Moreover, evidence from ocean sediment cores have also\nindicated similar “rapid changes in sea surface temperatures.”\n\nBut what, exactly, do these inferred climatic changes constitute? What the Greenland ice\ncores really indicate is that there was a sudden increase in terrestrial heat “just over 11,000\nyears ago” when “the temperature shot up by 9 to 18 degrees Fahrenheit...in possibly less",
