And if this applied to one particular individual, it must surely apply to others.\n\nOther studies have since then indicated that psychiatric malfunctions tend to rise signifi-\ncantly with high levels of solar radioflux and sudden magnetic disturbances in the iono-\nsphere.?\n\nCan it be imagined what humanity might have suffered through these additional effects\nduring and after the proto-Saturnian system’s entry into the Solar System which brought it\ninto direct contact with the new electrical potential of our present Sun? Can one imagine\nwhat the braking of Earth’s rotation, with its accompanying atmospheric disturbances, would\nhave wrought on mankind?\n\nBut even this, coupled with Earth’s tectonic pangs, was not the greatest influential cause\nin the change that occurred in the human psyche due to proto-Saturn’s glorious, and\nrelatively destructive, flare-up. What changed the most, and what altered the minds of our\nancestors more than anything, was the transformation that transpired in the sky. After untold\nages of sameness, during which Paleolithic man took the immobile sun suspended in Earth’s\nnorth celestial sphere and its attendant column of tapering light for granted, a revolutionary\ntransformation ushered in a series of cosmic events, catastrophic in their own right, which\ncontinued to unfold for generations to come. What had been an inanimate fixture, now\nseemed imbued with life. And because man was intelligent enough to understand that Earth’s\ncataclysmic upheaval had been caused by this newly active entity, he sought to appease it in\nan effort to keep it from repeating its destructive actions. From that time on, man sought to\nemulate it, both in its assumed evil and benign aspects. Men tried to imitate what it did, even\nto the point of exterminating some of their own kind, in order to condone its actions in the\nbelief that it would thus recognize them as its own kith and kin.\n\nIn time, there appeared other bodies suspended between Earth and proto-Saturn and they,\ntoo, involved themselves in the cosmic drama that continued to unfold down through the\nages. To ancient man, these newly visible bodies were all imbued with life, a life that was not\nonly mysterious in its assumed disposition, but also extremely potent. The power that these\nbodies were seen to wield was far beyond anything man had known before. And while this\npower could be imitated, it could never be duplicated. Thus it was that these cosmic bodies\ndeveloped into what eventually became known as gods—celestial entities that had no\ncounterparts on Earth and yet with an incredible power over it. And as our ancestors saw fit\nto imitate the proto-Saturnian deity, so did they continue to emulate the deeds of these newly\ndeveloped gods that were soon to dominate the celestial realm. As man was to remember in\ntimes to come: “Thus the gods did; thus men do.”3 The well-being of the human race became\ndependent on what evolved into a sacrosanct decree. As later pundits were to admit: “We\nmust do what the gods did in the beginning.” It was in this manner that ritual, and eventually\nreligion, took an obsessive hold on the human mind.",

This nebulous cloud seems to have been what our ancient forefathers alluded to as\nlane. This nebulous cloud seems to have been what our ancient forefathers alluded to as\nChaos.\nHypothesis #4: During this same period, the proto-Saturnian orb was described as having\nfloated over an apparition which looked like a sheet of celestial water, a cosmic ocean.\nWhether this “water” was the same conjectured circumstellar disk, which would have given\nthe appearance of a celestial whirlpool, an auroral manifestation, or a combination of both\nhhenomena, is not now easily determined.\nphenomena, is not now easily determined.\nHypothesis #5: That this proto-Saturnian assemblage was at first the only visible celestial\nentity in Earth’s primordial sky.\nHypothesis #6: That, as seen from Earth, the proto-Saturnian primary did not rise or set,\nbut remained visibly immobile at all times.\nut remained visibly immobile at all times.\nHypothesis #7: That proto-Saturn’s immobility was due to the fact that Earth was sta-\ntioned directly “beneath” proto-Saturn’s south pole and that, from Earth, proto-Saturn ap-\npeared to be permanently fixed in the north celestial sphere, the very place which is now oc-\ncupied by the Pole Star. What this also means is that Earth and proto-Saturn were linearly\naligned with both of them sharing the same axis of rotation.\nHypothesis #8: That what appeared to be a slow-twirling narrow beam of tapering light\nconnected the proto-Saturnian orb to Earth’s north polar region. This ray from above is inter-\npreted as a sustained plasma discharge in the form of Birkeland current, a scaled-down ver-\nreted as a sustained plasma discharge in the form of Birkeland current, a scaled-down ver-\nsion, or the slowly deteriorating remnant, of a so-called plasma “jet” as presently observed\nstreaming from galactic and stellar objects, and as in fact has been detected emanating from\nbrown dwarf stars.\nrown dwarf stars.\nHypothesis #9: That Earth was originally engulfed in what our ancestors persistently re-\nferred to as darkness. This was an age which, despite its remoteness in time, ended up\netching itself indelibly in human consciousness. It was a time during which the Sun, the\nMoon, and the stars were not yet visible in the sky. Proto-Saturn ruled alone. And yet this",

The\nterrestrial environment during this age therefore seems to have been bathed in a perpetual\ntwilight or, rather, a protracted dawn, which man remembered as the dawn of Creation.\nHypothesis #10: That this system was embedded in a plasmasphere centered on proto-\nSaturn, the opacity of which enabled proto-Saturn’s radiation to be reflected toward all\nterrestrial latitudes.\nHypothesis #11: That Proto-Saturn’s illumination, relatively feeble as it might have been,\ntogether with the plasmasphere’s opacity, are recognized as the means by which the stars\nwere kept from visibility. The Sun, on the other hand, was still too far to be seen, while the\nMoon had not yet been captured by Earth.\nHypothesis #12: That, under the scheme described above, Earth would have received\nenough heat to sustain life. This heat would have radiated directly from proto-Saturn’s close\nproximity above Earth’s northern hemisphere. The southern latitudes would also have re-\nceived sufficient warmth, even if a feebler light, from the radiation that would have been re-\nflected off the inner surface of proto-Saturn’s plasmasphere within which Earth would have\nbeen enveloped. In the northern hemisphere, this indirect radiation would have added to the\ndirect heat and light received from above Earth’s northern pole. Thus, during this time,\nEarth’s climatic environment would have been one without seasonal change, luxuriating in\none single season of eternal spring. (It should, however, be kept in mind that Earth would\nalso have been subjected to slightly different latitudinal temperatures.) Tropical and/or sub-\ntropical flora and fauna were thus able to thrive in Earth’s northern region, even within the\npresent Arctic Circle, and the possibility exists that this flora and fauna originated in these\nregions before migrating to more southerly latitudes.\nHypothesis #13: That, due to Saturn’s immobility, and the absence of the Sun, ancient\nman had nothing at his disposal by which he could calculate the passage of time.\nHypothesis #14: That, as the proto-Saturnian system drew closer to the present Sun’s do-\nmain of influence, their plasmaspheres came in contact with each other, electric potentials\nclashed, and cosmic sparks began to fly.\nHypothesis #15: That the first sign of this plasmaspheric contact was the electrical imbal-\nance suffered by the jet-like Birkeland column which joined proto-Saturn to Earth, which jet\nthen underwent a series of visible instabilities the likes of which mankind commenced to re-\nproduce in his sacred art down through the years.\nHypothesis #16: That, following this series of awe-inspiring volatilities, the jet was seen\nto retract itself and disappear within the proto-Saturnian orb that had originally been\nresponsible for its very birth.\nHypothesis #17: That, within a short time of that event, due to the disproportionate\nelectrical energy between proto-Saturn and the Sun, the former flared up in a glorious burst\nof light that dispelled the gloom, an event that went down in the mytho-history of mankind as\nDay One.!",

This\nwould then have culminated in a boost of the terrestrial field which would then have com-\nmenced to decay once more in its attempt to adjust to the Sun’s own field of influence.\nHypothesis #20: That, very much like the Sun’s flares achieve at present on a much\nsmaller scale, proto-Saturn’s flare-up braked Earth’s rotational speed, with its former rate of\nrotation resuming not long after.\nHypothesis #21: That this temporary braking effect resulted in the oceans’ incursion over\nlarge areas of the land as well as additional heat due to friction between\nEarth’s crustal layers which also caused tremendous tectonic activity including global vol-\ncanism, earthquakes, landslides, and various other upheavals.\nHypothesis #22: That the calamities incurred by Earth throughout these events, including\ncosmic radiation, were responsible for great loss of life among both beasts and the human\nspecies. Vast hordes of animals which existed during the Ice Age were completely extermi-\nnated, never again to grace the land or the oceans they once inhabited.\nHypothesis #23: That the cosmic radiation released by proto-Saturn’s flare-up would\nhave also resulted in the birth of mutated defective offspring both among animals and\nhumankind, but that, with some possible exceptions, including racial divergence among\nhumans, these mutations were not passed on to following generations.\nHypothesis #24: That, due to the heat released by proto-Saturn’s flare-up, as well as that\nincurred through Earth’s frictional tectonics, the glaciers of the Pleistocene Ice Age com-\nmenced to melt, thus causing further floods and mud slides. Previous glaciated areas were\nthus reclaimed and, in time, the greening of these regions added tremendously to the habita-\nbility of Earth’s northern hemisphere.\nHypothesis #25: That, following its flare-up, proto-Saturn continued to shine much\nbrighter than it had previously done, bright enough for ancient man to have persistently al-\nluded to it as a sun.\nHypothesis #26: That this primordial proto-Saturnian sun shone during that time we pres-\nently allude to as the night.\nHypothesis #27: That, as the proto-Saturnian system moved deeper into the Solar System,\nits plasmasphere changed its electromagnetic wavelength, thus robbing it of its former near-\nopacity. It was during this time that ancient man was able to catch a glimpse of the slowly\napproaching Sun which, at first, appeared no bigger than a star, but which grew ever larger\nand brighter as Earth continued to draw nearer.\nThroughout this work we have dated proto-Saturn’s flare-up, the end of the Pleistocene\nIce Age, and all that these entailed, to c. 10,000 years ago. This date is based on a statistical\n512.\n512",

        "content": "analysis of accumulated dates from various disciplines which average out to the proposed\nfigure. Granted that some of these accumulated dates were derived from various radiometric\ntechniques, how do we reconcile that with our oft-stated doubt concerning the validity of\nthese methods? Before we are accused of attempting to have our cake and eat it too, please\nkeep in mind that our posited date has been presented merely as a benchmark figure. One can\nperhaps use the adage that where there is smoke there is bound to be a fire. But it goes\nbeyond that since it is our belief that if these dates are wrong, they are all wrong by the same\namount. Move any one of them up or down the geologic timescale, and the rest would move\naccordingly. For the time being, it matters little whether proto-Saturn’s flare-up occurred\n10,000 years ago, earlier than that, or later. What remains of importance is that the\nPleistocene Ice Age came to an abrupt end due to the flare-up in question. Until a better tech-\nnique can be found for the absolute dating of geologic strata and palaeontological remains, to\nsay nothing of human artifacts, that should be enough.\n\nIt should finally be stressed that while edifices can easily, and sometimes suddenly, be\ndestroyed, they are not so easily, or so suddenly, erected. While we believe we have now\nfound the solution concerning the end of the Pleistocene Ice Age, we have come up with\nnothing concerning its inception. Worse than that, while it might be readily understood how\nthe heat unleashed by proto-Saturn’s flare-up would have melted Earth’s northern glaciers,\nwould it not be stretching things too far were we to claim that similar events would have also\nmelted the glaciers of previous ice ages? After all, proto-Saturn’s disruptive flare at the end\nof the Pleistocene was occasioned by the system’s entry into our present Sun’s domain of\ninfluence. But this event could only have transpired once. What, then, could have caused the\nmelting of previous glaciated areas? More importantly, what could have caused these areas to\nbe glaciated in the first place? That is a problem, among others, the very next volume of this\nseries intends to solve.\n\nStay with me.\n\n513",
