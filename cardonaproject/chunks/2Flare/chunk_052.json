At\nthe south pole we have what appears to be a hurricane with a giant eye, and at the\nnorth pole of Saturn we have this geometric feature, which is completely different.”?\nBut, apart from its hexagonal shape, is the feature in Saturn’s north pole really all that\ndifferent from the one in the south? Is not a stationary jet stream—which is what the northern\nformation was deduced to be in 1988 —akin to a stationary hurricane?\nDespite the fact that it would have been entirely invisible from Earth, and therefore not\ndocumented in the mytho-historical record, proto-Saturn’s sustained Birkeland current would\nhave extended from both poles. What we thus see in Saturn’s present poles, both north and\nsouth, are the atmospheric remnants of its former bi-polar jet.

Hanlon’s Worlds of Galileo, phrased it:\n“One of the most startling discoveries [from the Galileo probe] was that ‘Jupiter may be a\nlong way from home, an interloper from the far outer reaches of the Solar System’ that only",

Granted that the above does not have\nJupiter entering the Solar System from outside it, such theorizing removes our own thesis\nfrom the realm of improbabilities in which it had been viewed in previous years.\nIn fact, astrophysicists have come even closer to our scheme than the above. According to\na 2005 item on Scientific American’s web site, computer simulations have been successful in\nreconstructing a “close encounter between our sun and a passing star,” even though, as usual,\nthey restricted the occurrence to “some four billion years ago.” And yet, very much as in our\nown scenario, this event was considered to have possibly “played a role in shaping our solar\nsystem.”3 One “potential scenario” even showed “our sun kidnapping a planet or smaller ob-\nject from the other star’s entourage.” Or how about having kidnapped the entire retinue?\nFLARING ENERGY\nThe energy that would have been released by proto-Saturn’s flare-up can be compared to\nthat from the highly magnetized pulsar dubbed SGR 1900+14. On August 27, 1998, it re-\nleased a flare so powerful it came close to frying a number of artificial satellites.>\n“When the wave of energy from the flare swept across the night side of Earth, it ion-\nized the outer atmosphere and affected radio communications. The accompanying X-\nray pulse had so much energy that even from 25,000 light-years away, it pushed the\ntop of the ionosphere down from an altitude of 85 miles (120 km) to 60 miles (100\nkm).”6\nMeanwhile, an 11-pound meteorite that slammed into eastern China in the mid 1980s has\nprovided scientists with chemical and radioactive “strong new evidence that a massive stellar\nblast helped shape the evolution of our infant solar system.”7? The evidence in question con-\nsisted in the meteorite’s inclusion of chlorine 36, an element which is absent from the Solar\nSystem. Chlorine 36 can, however, be traced through its decay product of sulfur 36 which, in\nturn, could have been produced in two different ways, either through a supernova or through\nstronger solar radiation than at present.’ Faced with these two possibilities, it was almost\nlogical for astrophysicists to opt for the second alternative, since “a supernova close to our\nbudding solar system would have blasted our sun and its protoplanetary disk into bits.”\nBut, for one thing, the early Sun had always been claimed to have been much fainter than\nat present, so that the production of chlorine 36 in the Solar System’s early “days” is more",

Although not everyone agrees,! this has led to the\nbelief that these outer bodies had to have been disturbed by the passage of a rogue star? or a\nlarge planet.? Among these bodies is the one dubbed Sedna which, on an earlier page of this\nwork, was suggested to have been expelled from the Kuiper Belt into its odd position outside\nthe Belt’s demarcation by the entry of the proto-Saturnian system into the Sun’s realm of in-\nfluence. Notice now what astrophysicists themselves concluded before the present book went\ninto print:\n“Sedna shouldn’t be there. There’s no way to put Sedna where it is. It never comes\nclose enough to be affected by the sun, but it never goes far enough away from the\nsun to be affected by other stars...Sedna is stuck, frozen in place; there’s no way to\nmove it. And if there’s no way to move it, basically there’s no way to put it there—\nunless it formed there. But it’s in a very elliptical orbit, and there’s no way to form\nanything in an elliptical orbit like that. It simply can’t be there. There’s no possible\nway —except it is.”4\nAll of which led Mike Brown to theorize that Sedna could have been placed where it\nmore or less is at present “in the earliest history of the solar system,” but only if “there used\nto be stars a lot closer than they are now.” Those stars could then have “affected Sedna on the\nouter part of its orbit” and then “moved away.”> But which is the most logical scenario, that a\nbevy of normal stars could have shifted their position as much as Brown’s theory requires, or\nthat a single and much less massive brown dwarf happened to pass that way? If other objects\nwithin the Kuiper Belt can be thought of as having been disrupted by a passing star, then why\ncould not Sedna have been exiled from the Belt?\nBy March of 2007, remnants of a smash-up between objects in the Kuiper Belt, marked\nas “the first ‘collisional family’,” were reported to have been discovered. The body which\ncaused this “fiery collision” has been identified as a massive object “which was nearly the\nsize of Pluto.”\nWhat amazes me is the detailed scenario astrophysicists can reconstruct from the little\nthat can be detected at this distance. Thus, for example, the culprit of this particular disaster,\nbelieved to have once been probably spherical, is now said to have been flattened into a\n“football-shaped” object. Its diameter has been calculated to be about 930 miles (1,500\nkilometers), but believed to have probably been 20 percent larger before the collision. The",

The amount of energy that would have been generated by the\nblast “would have equaled about 10 billion nuclear bombs.” The impact would have blasted\nlarge icy chunks into space, sending the parent body reeling, causing it to spin end-over-end\nat the present rate of once every four hours. Moreover, the impact is said to have “spawned at\nleast seven other rocky objects—and likely more—with diameters ranging from 6 to 250\nmiles (10 to 400 km). All of this on the “matching gray color” which is clamed to be unique\nto these particular bodies in the entire Kuiper Belt. And, needless to say, the accident in\nquestion has been dated to 4.5 billion years ago “when the Kuiper Belt was much more\ncrowded than it is now and objects were more likely to bump into one another.”!\n\nIt almost makes one think they were actually there to see it all transpire on the spot. Or\nwho would have taken me seriously had I supplied such specificity in relation to proto-Sat-\nurn’s entry into the Solar system?\n\nFurther evidence of this disturbance is also indicated by Neptune’s chaotic satellite\nsystem and its relation to Pluto. This was first brought to readers’ attention in 1979 by the\nastronomer Tom Van Flandern who, with his co-author, argued that this unruly system\nresulted from Neptune’s encounter with a massive Solar System body.”\n\nWallace Thornhill, on the other hand, is of a mind with us when he thinks it more likely\nthat the disruption in question was caused by the entry of the proto-Saturnian system into that\ndominated by our present Sun.? While, on an earlier page, we had already posited that proto-\nSaturn would have probably picked up a few members from the Sun’s encircling Kuiper Belt,\nWallace thinks that smaller bodies which had belonged to the proto-Saturnian system might\nhave been torn from its weakening grip as it passed by Neptune. This, too, is a possibility. In\nfact it has been suggested that “a few of our minor planets beyond Pluto (like Sedna) origi-\nnally belonged to another star.”5 That other star could very well have been the proto-Sat-\nurnian sub-brown dwarf.\n\nWhich of these two scenarios is the most likely to have transpired, I will leave for others\nto decide, although, to be sure, there is nothing against the possibility that both events tran-\nspired. There is nothing against proto-Saturn having lost some of its minor members in its\nretinue while gaining others in exchange. And, to be sure, this, too, has been suggested.\nThus, according to Scott Kenyon and Benjamin Bromley, respectively hailing from the\nSmithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the University of Utah, a passing star could have\n“stolen objects from the outer Kuiper belt,” while some of the other objects in the Belt could\nvery well be “alien worlds that were captured from the passing star in a two-way swap of\nmaterial.”6",

I will not here go into any of that besides stating that Earth’s temperature\nwill always fluctuate up and down through the ages as it has done since time immemorial.\nEarth’s variations in its orbital path around the Sun are minimal enough, but not so the Sun’s\nown disparity of heat dissipation. Earth will continue to warm up and it will cool again. But,\nbarring any major accidents between the bodies of the Solar System, it will never boil nor\nwill it ever freeze again to the extent of previous ice ages. All calculations conducted at\npresent in an endeavor to find out what might transpire in the future in this respect are based\non computations concerning what is believed to have transpired in the past. In all these\nestimates the Sun is made to play an influential role since it is not yet generally accepted that\nit had nothing to do with ice ages in the first place. Until scientists remove Earth out of the\nSolar System and couple it with its primeval proto-Saturnian sun, all such reckonings will\nprove in vain.\nBEHAVIORAL METAMORPHOSIS\nWith the heat released by the proto-Saturnian flare-up; the melting of the northern gla-\nciers; the hurricane-strength winds created by Earth’s rotational braking; rains of sticky,\nwhen not burning, naphtha; the sweeping of the oceans over vast areas of the land; global\nvolcanism; diastrophism; earthquakes; additional recurring floods in areas outside former\nglacial demarcation; the tremendous loss of life both in the animal kingdom and among",

And this, too, had its effect on the human psyche. As is now common\nknowledge, the magnetic fields we have treated of in the past pages of this work are\nintricately entwined with the processes of life itself.\n“At the moment it is difficult to assess human sensitivity to weak magnetic fields, such\nas that of Earth [wrote Frederic Jueneman], but it is well-known that biological organ-\nisms reorient themselves in response to magnetic effects. Lower lifeforms, as bacteria\nand protozoa, show reduced reproductive activity in the absence of magnetism, and\nsmaller mammals and birds also show strange behavior and fundamental changes in\nmotor response when shielded from magnetic fields for some length of time.”!\nThe late Earl Milton had even more to say about the subject. “I am impressed by what I\nhave read,” he wrote. “In almost every field I encounter I find the imprint of electricity.”\n“The books tell me that when there is a surplus of negative ions in the atmosphere we\nhumans feel better [he went on]. Other books tell me that a strong magnetic environ-\nment superimposed on the weakly magnetic field of the Earth improves plant\ngrowth.”3\nBut also:\n“The fatality rate increases by about a factor of 3 when the Earth is disturbed magneti-\ncally. I live in a region of the world where the Chinook winds blow...When they blow,\nthe atmospheric pressure varies rapidly and the electric field above the Earth’s surface\nfluctuates; people get migraine headaches. After about 3 days of continuous winds\npeople start to fight over trivial things, psychological disturbances increase, murders\nand suicides become more likely. There is a lot of evidence that comparable environ-\nmental stress occurs in other places where electric or magnetic disturbances are com-\nmon.”4\nThe validity of the above concise commentary is evidenced by a research program called\nProject Migraine conducted by the biologist Christopher Dodge in 1980 which indicated that\na sufferer of migraine headaches was uniquely sensitive to alterations in electromagnetic",
