        "content": "In reporting at a conference sponsored by the Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel,\nMaryland, the Voyager scientists confessed that they could not explain the phenomenon.! This\ndid not, however, stop them from theorizing about it. Ed Keath suggested that some of the\ncloud may be composed of “debris attracted and shaped by the magnetic field, or magneto-\nsphere, that surrounds Saturn.”? Another source for the plasma ring has been blamed on a\nprocess known as sputtering, in which “particles crash into Saturn’s nearby moons and chip\noff bits of matter.” It had nevertheless to be admitted that none of the above scenarios can be\nmade to account for the cloud’s high temperature. “The processes responsible for heating the\ncloud up,” Doug Hamilton reported, “are not yet known.”4\n\nUnder the scheme presented in this work, it almost goes without saying that proto-Saturn’s\npostulated flare-up accords quite well with the existence of this plasmatic cloud as well as its\nhigh temperature.\n\nDATING THE EVENT\n\nFor decades my colleagues and I have been asked to place a date on proto-Saturn’s disrup-\ntion. For years, all I could honestly offer was a time somewhere in the prehistoric past. Man’s\nprehistory, however, has been longer than his history, so that my contribution was not nearly\nenough to satisfy those who had been asking for a date.> As the years went by, and research\nunearthed further evidence, I could narrow the gap by pointing to a time somewhere between\nthe Paleolithic and Neolithic age.® Today I can be a little more explicit by claiming that proto-\nSaturn’s flare-up brought the Paleolithic age to an abrupt end. But even this will not be\nenough to satisfy those who still call for an actual date. For them the question is not so much\nwhere to place the event chronologically; they want to know how many years ago it\ntranspired. Of course, at this point, all one has to do is date the end of the Paleolithic. But,\ndespite the progress of archaeology, this is not as easy as it sounds.\n\nGenerally speaking, Paleolithic objects can be placed chronologically as belonging to an\nearly, middle, or late period. This can be done in several ways. The most accurate depends on\nthe strata in which the artifacts are found—the higher the stratum in the ground, the more re-\ncent it has to be. A less certain method involves the comparison of styles, but this can only be\ndone after the styles of the respective periods have already been chronologically tabulated.\nBoth these methods, as well as others, are themselves fraught with difficulties. Objects from a\nhigher stratum can migrate through various processes into a lower one, thus supplying a false\nchronological placement. Similar styles, on the other hand, are not necessarily indicative of the",

        "content": "same period. But even the correct chronological placement of Paleolithic objects does not, in\nitself, supply archaeologists with a series of actual dates.!\n\nCorrect dating requires a correct dating technique. But most methods can only date objects\nand/or the carbonized remains of objects. They are not very useful when it comes to dating the\nend of an epoch, an era, or a shorter age. At present, the radiocarbon method is the technique\nmost favored by archaeologists. Although, like others, it cannot be used to supply us with an\nabsolute date for the end of the Paleolithic age, it at least has been used to date various articles\nfrom that period.” If nothing else, this should give us an idea concerning the antiquity of the\nage in question. But is the radiocarbon method really all that accurate?\n\nDebates on this issue have ranged since the introduction of the method by Willard Libby.\nRight from its inception, certain anomalies came to light which raised the undesired voice of\ncriticism. As time went by and more items were tested, the anomalies accumulated at an unrea-\nsonable rate. Archaeologists began to cast doubt on the validity of the method. Eventually a\ncorrective measure was introduced into the radiocarbon method through reliance on dendro-\nchronology. Unfortunately, this technique, which is based on the counting and matching of tree\nrings, is just as faulty as the one it is meant to correct.3 And even then, the anomalies did not\ndisappear; on the contrary they continued to accumulate.\n\nAt bottom, of course, lies the fact that the radiocarbon method depends on the assumption\nthat the atmospheric content of Carbon-14 has been constant throughout Earth’s history. But,\nas various authorities have demonstrated, nearby supernovae tend to increase the carbon-14\ncontent in our atmosphere.* This, alone, is enough to throw the entire radiocarbon method of\ndating out of kilter. I could end my argument there, but consider also this: If “nearby” superno-\nvae, by which astrophysicists mean anything up to 500 pc,> can upset the Carbon-14 content in\nour atmosphere, how much more would the much closer proto-Saturnian flare-up have dis-\nrupted Earth’s atmospheric Carbon-14 production?\n\nAdded to all this is the fact that archaeologists do not always agree among themselves con-\ncerning the age of items, sites, strata, and periods. Nor have the attributed dates been known to\nbe constant through the years. This latter is perhaps understandable since newer discoveries, to\nsay nothing of newer methods, tend to refine older dates. But, given the yo-yoing of dates\nthrough the years, one remains hard-pressed to come to a definite conclusion about the abso-\nlute age of anything in the prehistoric past. Thus, for instance, in 1961, the retreat of the Ice\nAge was calculated to have transpired in 18,000 B.C.; the end of the Magdalenian period was",

        "content": "placed somewhere around 8000 B.C., with the beginning of the Neolithic in the Near East at\nabout the same time.! But, during the same year, authorities in Britain differed. The end of the\nIce Age was there believed to have transpired sometime between 9000 and 8000 B.C.,? with\nthe end of the Magdalenian, the entire Paleolithic, and the advent of the Neolithic (including\nthe Mesolithic) all occurring around 10,000 B.C.3 In continental Europe, where, to confuse\nmatters further, an entirely different terminology has been adopted, what is termed the Wiirm\nGlaciation, which is the last period of the Pleistocene Ice Age, is dated at 125,000 years ago,\nwhich would have ended about 11,000 years ago at the beginning of the Holocene.* The Pa-\nleolithic art at Lascaux has been dated at 15,515 + 900 years, with deposits from the Middle\nMagdalenian period at 14,050 years.5 These last two items, however, have absolutely nothing\nto tell us about the end of the Paleolithic which, given the above dates, would have to be later\nthan 14,000 B.C.\n\nWith so many confusing dates flying around, I refuse to be pigeonholed. As Frederic Jue-\nneman stated some time back: “Too many difficulties in our present dating methods prevent\neven an attempt to establish the timing with anything approaching precision.”6 Fair enough,\nthere have been finer refinements through the years since Jueneman wrote the above, but,\neven then, it all depends on which authority one wishes to rely. In any case, I am not about to\nstart splitting hairs at this point, so let us stick to generalities.\n\nThe best that can be extracted from the above, give or take a little, and in keeping with a\nround figure, is that the end of the Ice Age and the end of the Paleolithic age coincided some-\nwhere around 10,000 B.C. And, since the Neanderthals did not make it into the following\nNeolithic age, it can be safely stated that they succumbed at around the same time. Would it,\ntherefore, be unreasonable to claim a single cause for all three terminations?\n\nA BENCHMARK FIGURE\n\nAs long as it is kept in mind that this 10,000 years is an approximate and rounded figure,\nwe can use it as a benchmark to pin-point the “date” of proto-Saturn’s flare-up with some\naccuracy. The next question, therefore, is: Can this date be validated?\n\nUsing various lines of reasoning in early scenarios which differ from ours, some catastro-\nphists have nevertheless zeroed in on the same date or one that is not that far off. One excep-\ntion was Alfred de Grazia who claimed that a “set of [cosmic] catastrophes” took place during\nthe Holocene epoch which he dated at 14,000 years ago.” He then posits a fissioning flare by\nproto-Uranus, which he termed Super-Uranus, “around 11,500 years ago,” and another by what\nhe termed Super-Saturn “around 6000 years ago.”§ De Grazia based this on the well known",

Unfortunately there is nothing in the mytho-historical record that can be attributed to the\nplanet Uranus. Not only that, but, although Uranus can indeed be discerned, given good acuity\nof vision, with the naked eye in an unpolluted sky, the fact remains that the planet went unrec-\nognized, and thus undocumented, by all ancient observers. It even evaded the eyes of modern\nman up until 1781 when, as is well known, William Herschel discovered it.\n\nVelikovsky himself would not commit to an exact date, giving instead a somewhat wide\nrange, but leaning heavily toward our benchmark. “I am not in a position to point to the cen-\ntury or even millennium when the Universal Deluge took place,” he wrote, “but it must have\nhappened between five and ten thousand years ago, probably closer to the second figure.”! As\nalready noted, to Velikovsky, although not to us, the “Universal Deluge” followed seven days\nafter proto-Saturn’s flare-up, so that his date is also applicable to his Saturnian nova.\n\nPeter Warlow, keeping to his scheme which involves a series of partial and complete inver-\nsions of the terrestrial sphere, also dates one of these events at 10,000 years ago.”\n\nJ. Bernard Delair places the “last major” invasion of the Solar System by his postulated\ncosmic visitor, “a fragment of an exploded star,” at 11,500 years ago.> Together with Derek\nScott Allan, Delair had previously bolstered this catastrophe through evidence derived from the\ngeological record.+\n\nSimilar geological evidence, much of which applies to our own scenario, was also utilized\nby E. P. Izokh who blamed the catastrophe on Earth’s collision with a comet. He, too, placed\nthis occurrence at about 10,000 years ago.\n\nSince none of the above scenarios are identical to ours, with some of them differing con-\nsiderably, it may seem that their inclusion in this work amounts to nothing but a clutching at\nstraws in an endeavor to keep our benchmark figure’s head above the water. But apart from the\nold adage that wherever there is smoke, there is bound to be a fire, it should be noted that the\nreasoning and hard terrestrial evidence supplied by the above catastrophists is near-identical to\nours even if the actual cause proposed in each instance is not.\n\nTHE ALUMINUM CLOUD\n\nWhile I cannot be definite about the following, the discovery of a cloud of Aluminum-26\njust outside the Solar System and surrounding it might turn out to be vital to our hypothesis.\nAluminum-26 is a radioactive isotope with a half-life of about a million years and is believed\nto be produced in novae and supernovae outbursts.

Forty-five lightyears would locate the event beyond the present\nestimate of the Sun’s heliosphere. On the other hand, “no more distant than” could mean\nmuch less. Even so, this range was the result of an ad hoc assumption based on whether the\nAluminum-26 in question is or is not evenly distributed in interstellar space.? While it cannot,\ntherefore, be yet stated for certain that this cloud originated in proto-Saturn’s flare-up, there\nis at least a possibility that the event could have taken place within our time interval.\n\nAs noted, aluminum-26 has a half-life of about a million years. It then decays into\nmagnesium-26. But since no magnesium-26 has been discovered in the cloud, it cannot\nobviously be that old. Understandably, Clayton would not crawl too far on the proverbial\nlimb by committing himself to an absolute date for the occurrence that gave birth to this\ncloud. He felt more comfortable in sticking to a safe range. Given the half-life of aluminum-\n26, he reasoned that the nova-like outburst could have transpired as long ago as 1,000,000\nyears; but in view of the fact that it had not yet decayed into magnesium-26, he felt that the\nexplosion could just as easily have occurred a mere 10,000 years ago.\n\nEven so, whether or not the origin of this cloud had anything to do with proto-Saturn’s\nflare-up must, as of this writing, remain something of a moot question.

The flare itself was glorious and proto-Saturn continued to be\nremembered as a god of light. Man was never to forget the glory but he did not much wish to\nremember that the destruction which followed owed its cause to the manifestation of what\nhad by now become his god.\nThe Hebrews remembered Elohim but, in later times, they disassociated the planet from\nthe god. The planet Saturn itself they named Kewan and on it, rather than on its god, they\nblamed the tribulations it brought to man. For that reason, they described the planet as “the\nstar of evil which brings misfortune to Israel.”!\nOnly to Israel?— one may ask.\nThe very word “disaster,” from the Latin dis aster or dis astrum, means “evil star.” This\ncame about because, among the Romans, Saturnus was considered “both a good and malevo-\nlent deity.”? The Latin poet, Marcus Annaeus Lucanus, popularly and simply known as Lu-\ncan, described the same Saturnus as “a baleful star.”3\nAs Lewis Greenberg noted, “the words ‘saturnine,’ signifying gloomy, and ‘Saturnian,’\nmeaning Golden Age, offer a strange and almost inexplicable contrast.”4 In the end, this am-\nbivalence between good and evil resulted in the strange association of God with the Devil.\nGreenberg, however, was astute enough to recognize that “it would appear that the state of\nthe world was once closely dependent upon, and drastically altered by, the planet Saturn\nwhich itself must have undergone a transformation of cosmic magnitude.”>\nThat man tried to forget—although he did not succeed—was not because he willed it so,\nbut because it was painful to remember; because if god, from whom there seems to have been\nno protection, was a god of destruction, life beneath his cruel sceptre was akin to abject slav-\nery, an existence fraught with terror, a future pregnant with evil and impending annihilation.\nPrimitive man found it difficult to live under these conditions and his mind, in a collective at-\ntempt to retain its sanity, reversed the aspect of reality.

In Hebrew, as used in the Old Testament, the term\nshaitan “refers not to the personification of evil, but to an adversary,” himself “an agent of\nthe Lord who obstructs or opposes man.” In fact, as A. E. Garvie notes, before the Israelites\ncame in contact with Persian beliefs, “evil, whether as misfortune or as sin” was originally\n“assigned to divine causality.”4 It was only after their exile, by which time they had been\ninfluenced by Persia, that there developed in the Israelite nation a tendency “to separate all\nevil from God by ascribing its origin to Satan.”>\n\nWhat was the origin of this entity?\n\nTo be sure, there are some who have seen the name “Satan” as having been derived from\n“Saturn.” Etymologically, this cannot be accepted since, as already noted, the name Satan is\nmerely the English transcription of the Semitic Shaitan. There are other indications, however,\nthat the entity known as Satan owes its origin to the planetary god in question.\n\nThe Gospel of Bartholomew names this “adversary of men” as Beliar? (the same as Be-\nlial), which is merely a different rendering of Bel, whose identity as Saturn has been recog-\nnized by ancient as well as modern authorities.
