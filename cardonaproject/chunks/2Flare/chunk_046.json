It is then not entirely impossible that the KBOs represent the fragments of a\nplanetoid that was drawn into proto-Saturn’s Roche limit.\nlanetoid that was drawn into proto-Saturn’s Roche limit.\nBut then there is the problem concerning the nature of the KBOs.

Some appear as red, others as gray. There seems to be\nno other shade. Moreover, the two classes seem to be separated from each other—at least,\nthose farthest from the Sun come only in red.3 “Our findings are controversial because they\nare so unexpected,” Tegler announced, “Most astronomers expected the colors of Kuiper belt\nobjects to be the same.”4\nAnd, as Romanishin reported: “The existence of two surface colors suggests to us that\nsomething important and unexpected happened long ago in the outer solar system.”> What\nthis seems to imply is that the KBOs are the remains of two, rather than one, original body.\nBut, while possible, is it probable that proto-Saturn would have drawn two distinct bodies\nwithin its own Roche limit and that it shattered both of them? Or could it be that these two\nbodies had already been shattered, perhaps in contact with each other, at the time of proto-\nSaturn’s passage?\nWhichever the case, there is little doubt that proto-Saturn, together with Earth, would\nhave been bombarded by some of these fragments. One or two might even have been\ncatapulted outside the Belt. In fact, even as this was being written, in March 2004, one of\nthese bodies seems to have been discovered.

Moreover, its elliptical\norbit has been calculated to be somewhere from 12,000 to 10,500 years or so.! As Wallace\nThornhill noted:\n“Sedna is an interesting object because it cannot have formed where we find it, ac-\ncording to conventional cosmology. It requires an ad hoc expulsion from the inner\nsolar system.?\nExpulsion from the inner Solar System might not be a viable explanation, but expulsion\nfrom the region of the so-called Kuiper Belt through the passage of the proto-Saturnian\nsystem would definitely be in keeping with our proposed scenario. Thornhill, on the other\nhand, has a slightly different take which should also be considered.\n“My view [he wrote] is that proto-Saturn ejected a lot of material equatorially in\nspectacular discharge activity as it adjusted to the Sun’s electrical environment. I\nwould expect the discharge activity to [have been] strongest when proto-Saturn\ncrossed the Sun’s current sheet (roughly the plane of the ecliptic). So bodies like\nSedna probably have orbital elements that reflect their point of origin in the ecliptic\nplane and their initial velocity in Saturn’s equatorial plane.”?\nAnd, as Amy Acheson noted,‘ if this is Sedna’s first return to perihelion, it would mean\nthat whatever event drove it into its present orbit would have transpired around 12,000 to\n10,000 years ago which, given the preliminary calculations involved, brings it close to our\nbenchmark date.\nIMPACTS\nReturning now to terrestrial impacts, as Thornhill noted, no meteorites “have been found\nin any ancient geological formation, which suggests that most surviving meteorites are rela-\ntively quite young.”> The question, however, is: How young? Better still, if impacts did occur\nat the time in question, where are all the relevant craters?\nTo begin with, smaller meteors would have burned up during their entry through Earth’s\natmosphere. Not only would they not have formed craters, they would not have left anything\nof themselves. Falling meteorites, on the other hand, do not always produce craters, just as not\nall craters are due to impacting meteorites.

Thus, for instance, a seven-fold\nimpact “in all the world’s oceans” 9,640 years ago has been postulated on the evidence of\nice-core samples.”\n\nTo back this up, craters have been located on the ocean floor in the Adriatic, near New\nZealand, in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bering Sea, the Great Lakes of North America, the South\nChina Sea, the Baltic, the Aegean, the Gulf of Corinth, the delta of the Orinoco, and the shelf\noff Nova Scotia’\n\nWorthy of special notice is a wide expanse of the ocean bed in the middle of the North\nSea which contains so many craters that it has been likened to the lunar topography.?\n\n(Note: The so-called Carolina Bays and other oriented lakes which feature so prominently\nin the works of other cosmic catastrophists, and which are now undeniably recognized as the\nscars of impacting bodies, are the result of a later catastrophe which will be featured in a fu-\nture volume of this series.)",

It is now recognized that the Pleistocene epoch\nwas “the heyday of large mammals,” but “about 10,000 years ago...almost all the large\nanimals disappeared.”! Living in the nineteenth century, Alfred Wallace had already found\nreason to stress that:\n“We live in a zoologically impoverished world, from which the largest and fiercest,\nand strangest forms have recently disappeared; and it is, no doubt, a much better\nworld for us now that they are gone. Yet it is surely a marvelous fact, and one that\nhas hardly been sufficiently dwelt upon, this sudden dying out of so many large\nmammalia, not in one place only but over...the land surface of the globe.”\nAnd yet, what Wallace termed a “sudden dying out” has, by others, been interpreted as\nsudden only in a geologic sense since the disappearance of most of the Pleistocene mammals\nis mainly understood to have occurred “in the relatively brief span of a single millennium.”\nIn this we beg to differ—which is not to say that the extinctions took place in the brief span\nof a day, a month, or even a year. A thousand years, however, are not called for.\nAlan Cooper has his own reasons for suggesting “a single millennium” for the disappear-\nance of most of the Pleistocene fauna. “When a species begins to lose its habitat, as happened\nwhen Earth warmed up and the grasslands turned into forest,” he says, “what you see is a\nsteady dwindling of genetic diversity.”4 Others, however, blamed it all “on a prolonged\ndrought during the amelioration of climate following the last glaciation.”® It is difficult to see",

Given the millennium or so that Cooper believes in, animals could easily have migrated\nto more suitable regions as, in fact, some of the survivors—among them the Arctic fox, the\nsaiga antelope, and the reindeer—are known to have done.! In fact, Cooper himself realizes\nthat a change of climate, which is what would have caused a change in the environment,\nraises some serious problems of its own.?\nKeep in mind, as Derek Ager noted, that these extinctions did not result from the\nPleistocene glaciation, but sometime after the retreat of the ice?

North America\nalone, as Trevor Palmer noted, lost 75% of its genera of animals which included many of its\nmammoths, mastodons, horses, tapirs, camels, ground sloths, the saber-toothed cats, various\nbears, giant rodents, musk oxen, moose, and deer.”\n“In all, 33 genera disappeared between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago, and possibly a\nmuch shorter period than that. In South America at about the same time, 46 genera\nbecame extinct. These were all large mammals, including mastodons, edentates, ro-\ndents, ungulates, carnivores, horses, peccaries, camels and deer.

By then the theory depended “upon the\nsudden arrival of men in regions where animals had no adaptation towards evasive action.”\n“However, the likelihood of small bands of humans being able to exterminate huge\nand often dangerous animals is small... The evidence in Australia is also contrary to\nthe theory, as man is known to have entered the continent at least 30,000 years ago\nand therefore had coexisted with the large mammals for some 20,000 years. The\nbones of extinct Australian animals are never in the same layers as human arte-\nfacts.”3\nThat, however, was in 1986. The picture changed entirely before this work came to an\nend. The opposite is now being claimed, that a “newly compiled fossil record of Australian\nmammals bolsters the notion that humanity’s arrival on the island continent led to the extinc-\ntion of many large creatures there.” By then, the arrival of humans in Australia had been\npushed back to 50,000 years ago.5 These exterminations, however, are claimed to have “oc-\ncurred at least 25,000 years before the most recent ice age began,”® so they need not bother\nus at this point.\nNew Zealand presents a different case in which the extinction of the moa, a giant\nflightless bird some of which achieved twelve feet in height, can definitely be attributed to\nhuman overkill. There were twenty species of this bird which disappeared in North Island\nonly about 500 to 700 years ago, probably before the arrival of the Maori, which would mean\nby an earlier incursion of Polynesians. The moas lingered longer on South Island, definitely\ndown to the time of Captain Cook’s visit. But, eventually, even these disappeared.\nOne must keep in mind, however, that, despite its speed, the moa was an ungainly animal\nwhen cornered and an easy prey to spear-wielding hunters. Moreover, it was native only to\nNew Zealand, two smallish islands when compared to the vast Pacific or, worse still, to the\nrest of the inhabited world. What needs hardly be told is that, while their remains have been\ntraced as far back as the Pliocene epoch, moas obviously survived the Pleistocene ex-\ntinctions.

        "content": "\ntogether with his student, Richard Lane, who were soon at the site, just one look to realize\nthat the bones belonged to the Ice Age mammoth known as Mammuthus columbi, who is\nknown to have\nknown to have become extinct some 8,000 years ago, a cousin to the better known\nbecome extinct some 8,000 years ago, a cousin to the better known\nMammuthus primigenius of Arctic regions.!\nWhile oil-digging operations were temporarily postponed, excavation continued in an ef-\nfort to learn more concerning the mammoth’s demise.

Unearthed during the exca-\nvation was “a chopper, a scraper, a few flakes chipped from some stone utensil, and quartzite\nrocks the size of\nrocks the size of bowling balls.”4 By the following year the mammoth’s vertebra was dis-\nowling balls.”4 By the following year the mammoth’s vertebra was dis-\ncovered seven feet away from the main skeleton, which seemed to indicate that man had sev-\nered this section for consumption. The discovery of a large flint knife beside the vertebra, to-\ngether with a cache of split and broken bones, cemented this conviction. Battered stones,\n“clearly used to crush the bones to extract marrow for food,” added to the picture.>\nSmashed bones, some of which bore the marks of scrapers, together with man-made tools\nand implements continued to turn up.° In the end, the evidence led to the following scenario:\n“The mammoth [got] trapped in the black mud of [a] bog. On the bank, hunters\nwatched as the struggling animal sank deeper. When they saw that the beast was\nhopelessly bogged down, they stoned it with boulders.\n“They could not crush the massive skull, but finally, after continual pounding, the\nmammoth weakened. Then a brave hunter perhaps finished the battle with a well-\nplaced spear.\nplaced spear.

They fought against the sucking mud\nthat eventually engulfed the hulk, leaving only the black ooze—and silence.”\nIt is possible that something of the sort might have transpired, but there is one discordant\nnote in the above\nnote in the above scenario—and it concerns the “brave hunter” who “finished the battle with\nscenario—and it concerns the “brave hunter” who “finished the battle with\na well-placed spear.” In fact, as the same report notes: “Despite the presence of stone knives,",
