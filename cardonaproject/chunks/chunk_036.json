                "content": "In the slow approach of the Saturnian system toward our present System, the Sun should,\nat some point, have become visible as a star which would then have been seen to slowly grow\nin size. Does primitive man remember anything of the sort?\n\nRecords of the slowly approaching Sun are somewhat rare. But then there is another point\nto consider. In view of the immobile Saturnian sun which shone perpetually above him,\nwould prehistoric man have really paid much attention to a slowly growing pin-point of light\nin the sky? And, of those that did, how many might have forgotten what to them would have\nseemed an unobtrusive circumstance? As Thornhill rightly claimed, \u201cthe [Saturnian} celestial\neffects as viewed from Earth would have been so dramatic that it seems to have completely\novershadowed even the growing appearance of the Sun as this loomed closer.\u201d!7\n\nAnd yet, the Okanagan Indians seem to have retained just such a memory when they\nspeak of that time, \u201clong, long ago, when the sun was young and no bigger than a star...\u201d 108\n\nFor the first time in the history of mankind, a light other than Saturn\u2019s managed to shine\nthrough the night of nights.\n\nThe Ipurinas of the Upper Amazon not only preserved a similar record of the Sun\u2019s origi-\nnal small size but also of its growing larger as Earth drew nearer.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018sun\u2019 they tell...was originally very small, hardly \u2018a nail\u2019s breadth\u2019 across. But\none day it suddenly began to grow till it was \u2018a span\u2019 across. Then the waters began to\ntise and overflowed the world,.\u201d19\n\nA similar belief concerning the subject at hand is also to be found among the Sia of New\nMexico which, like that of the Ipurinas, also adds some interesting aspects of its own. As it is\nrelated by these people:\n\n\u201cWhen the sun was far off, his face was blue; as he came nearer, the face grew\nbrighter. Yet they did not see the sun himself, but only a large mask which covered\nhis whole body.\u201d 110\n\nThe main interesting point behind this ancient conviction is that the Sun was not merely\nremembered as having been smaller in size, or that it grew in size, but that it had actually\nonce been \u201cfar off.\u201d It also correctly presents the view that the Sun \u201cgrew brighter\u201d\nas it came nearer which, logical as this would be, is not mentioned in the other records we\nhave examined. The other additional point it mentions is that, when the Sun was still much\nfarther away, its face was blue. What this might relate to will be explained in the proposed\nsequel to this work.\n\nYn the meantime, and in order to forestall an objection, let us again look at our hypothesis\nfrom an astronomical point of view.

As the late David Griffard pointed out:\n\n\u201cAs point sources...apparent differences in the size of stars are only differences in\n as\nseen on a clear night, the present Sun would have to be removed about 10 light-years.\nEven if much closer and really, say, at zero magnitude...it would still have been four\nor five light-years away.\n\n\u201cWith present rates of relative stellar motion as guidelines, the growth from star to\nSun would have taken many tens of thousands of years even if the fastest observed\n is chosen; if at slower, more common speeds, (e.g. 12\nmi/sec), many eons longer.\u201d !!!\n\nIt is, then, the words \u201cno bigger than a star\u201d that seems to have led to the objection. \u201cNo\nbigger than\u201d should not, however, be construed to mean \u201cno closer than.\u201d In any case, who\never said anything about the size of the approaching Sun having been of 3rd or 4th magni-\ntude? Obviously, the Okanagan Indians, who were not astronomers, were not using this term\nin a strictly astronomical sense. They were merely reporting what their ancestors had claimed\nto have seen.\n\nBesides, as Griffard himself pointed out, \u201cif first seen, say from the distance of Pluto\n{taken as an arbitrary estimate of the limits of the Sun\u2019s domain) the Sun conceivably could\nhave appeared star-like and the time-line be reduced.\u201d !!?

The probability, however, is that, once captured within the Sun\u2019s attractive force, the\nSaturnian system would have slowly spiraled in, much in the manner hypothesized by\nastrophysicists in relation to their revised history of the Solar System as outlined above. Such\nan entry could have taken any number of years in excess of ten. Astronomers are fond of\ndescribing such events as having taken millions of years. Will they here allow me at least a\nfew thousand?\n\nBut then the reader might have\u2014should have, really\u2014noticed a discrepancy in our\nthinking at this point. How could the Sun, appearing no bigger than a star, have been visible\nthrough our plasmasphere when that same plasmasphere has been theorized to have been\nopaque enough to blot out the stars? Can we have our cake and eat it too? Of course not. And\nhere a confession is in order.\n\nI have presented these mytho-historical snippets concerning the approaching Sun as if the\nevent took place during the age of darkness when, in truth, the event took place later. In other\nwords, I have presented these data out of chronological sequence merely to make my point.\nThe approaching Sun, appearing no bigger than a star, became visible to Earth\u2019s inhabitants\nat that time when the plasmasphere came in contact with that of the Sun itself.

This was an age which,\ndespite its remoteness in time, ended up etching itself indelibly in human consciousness. It\nwas a time during which the Sun, the Moon, and the stars were not yet visible in the sky.\nSaturn ruled alone.\n\nHypothesis #7: This age, we have also found out, could not have been one of total\ndarkness, and that, in fact, mankind itself remembers that the Saturnian deity actually shed a\nfeeble light. The terrestrial environment during this age was bathed in a perpetual twilight or,\nrather, a protracted dawn, which man remembered as the dawn of Creation.\n\nHypothesis #8: Proto-Saturn\u2019s illumination, feeble as it might have been, together with\nthe plasmasphere\u2019s opacity are recognized as the means by which the stars were kept from\nvisibility. The plasmasphere\u2019s opacity, however, would probably not have been enough to\nblot out the Sun..\n\nHypothesis #9: That, during this period, a nebulous entity, which our ancestors had\ndifficulty in describing clearly, surrounded the Saturnian primary. We have conjectured this\nentity to have been a placental cloud, or circumstellar disk, surrounding the Saturnian orb.\nThis entity seems to have been that to which the ancients alluded to as Chaos.\n\nHypothesis #10: During this same unspecified period, the Saturnian orb was seen to float\nover an apparition which, to ancient man, looked like water, a cosmic ocean. This \u201cwater\u201d\nwas probably the same nebular disk which, spinning slowly, would have had the appearance\nof a celestial whirlpool.\n\nHypothesis # 11: That, due to Saturn\u2019s immobility, and the absence of the Sun, ancient\nman had nothing at his disposal by which he could calculate the passage of time.\n\n415 W.

In fact, as Wallace Thormhili has correctly speculated, life might have\nbeen much better suited to Earth as a satellite of the brown dwarf star that was proto-Saturn\nout in the far reaches of space.! Nor is this merely Thornhill\u2019s conjecture. Astronomers are\nnow voicing similar propositions.\n\nThere was a time, not so long ago, when the idea of life surviving on a planet heated by a\ndwarf star in the coldness of space outside our Solar System would have been deemed bizarre\nin the extreme. Newer studies and discoveries, however, have tended to make such a scenario\nquite palatable. Thus, those who have sought signs of habitable worlds other than our own\nare now looking to dwarf stars to furnish such evidence. Ken Croswell put it in a nutshell\nwhen he stated that: \u201cFar from being desolate backwaters, red dwarfs may harbour an abun-\ndance of alien life.\u201d*\n\n\u201cTt was always thought that any planet orbiting a red dwarf would be an extremely\nunlikely place to find life. But it now looks as though these dim red suns could har-\nbour most of the Galaxy\u2019s life-bearing worlds.\u201d?\n\nFor one thing, as Croswell notes, stars like our present Sun are relatively rare while four\nout of every five stars in our Galaxy happen to be red dwarfs. These stars have a somewhat\ncool core and the nuclear reactions which are believed to fuel them take place at a slow rate.\n\u201cThe nearest red dwarf\u2014Proxima Centauri, which is 4 light years from Earth,\u201d notes Cros-\nwell, \u201cemits less visible light in a century than the Sun does in a week.\u201d4 It is no wonder,\nthen, that dwarf stars had earlier been ruled out as sustainers of habitable planets.\n\nThis problem has now been overcome by positing planets \u201chuddled close enough\u201d to such\nstars, which contiguity would ensure \u201ca balmy climate.\u201d As Croswell explains: \u201cFor a red\ndwarf with one-hundredth of the Sun\u2019s brightness, for instance, a planet would be at a suit-\nable temperature if it circled ten times closer to its parent star than the Earth does to the\nSun.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d asked me a few years ago,\u201d David Soderblom has been reported to have stated,\n\u201cT would have said that red dwarfs have a very low probability of having life-bearing plan-\n\n1 W.

Brown dwarf stars, however, are actually red; they have\nmerely been designated as brown dwarfs only because the term \u201cred dwarfs\u201d had already\nbeen assigned to their slightly more massive siblings. True, brown dwarfs are said to radiate\nthrough a slightly different process.

In any case, both red and brown\ndwarfs come in various masses, so that the dividing line between them, as that between\nbrown dwarfs and planets, becomes merely arbitrary. If, therefore, life-bearing planets can\norbit red dwarf stars, they can just as easily accompany brown dwarfs.

As Croswell pointed out, \u201cthe day\nside of a red dwarf planet would fry.\u201d \u2018\u00a9 What is perhaps worse is that \u201cthe night side would\nbe so frigid\u201d that the atmosphere itself would be expected to freeze. !7 How could life have\nsurvived such conditions.\n\nOne way out of this dilemma, according to Croswell, would be to postulate that such a\nplanet\u2019s atmosphere would be \u201csufficiently thick.\u201d !8\n\n\u201cResearchers [have] calculated that gases circulating in the atmosphere would then be\nable to transport heat from the planet\u2019s day side to its night side, warming the night\nair so that it wouldn\u2019t freeze out.\u201d!9\n\nSuch transportation of heat from one hemisphere to the other would not only warm the\nplanet\u2019s night side, it would also cool its day side resulting in a balanced heat regime.\n\nWhat is interesting in this is that the same situation had also been proposed in relation to\nEarth itself. It was in the mid-19th century that the British anatomist, Richard Owen,\ndemanded a denser terrestrial atmosphere, containing elevated concentrations of carbon\ndioxide and reduced oxygen, in order for prehistoric pterodactyls to have been able to fly and\nnavigate.*\u00b0 Much later, Frederic Jueneman had much to say concerning the inability of\npterodactyls, known to have had wingspans of up to 36 feet, to fly and navigate in Earth\u2019s\npresent sky, and why a denser atmospheric envelope would have been required for such\nflight in prehistoric times.?!\n\n13 Jbid., p. 28.\n\n14 W.

Horrabin.)\n\nThe idea, of course, did not go unchallenged,\u201d but other voices were soon to be added to\nthe pro-list. Thus, the problem did not only touch pterodactyls, but also the prehistoric\ninsects of the Carboniferous Period. These included dragonflies with two-and-a-half-foot\nwingspans and mayflies as big as canaries. These, too, were believed to have been impossible\nto fly in our present atmosphere.\u201d? As Jeffrey Graham recalls: \u201cI remember seeing models of\ngiant dragonflies as a child and wondering how they could fly.\u201d3\u00b0 But in the mid 1990s, a\nsolution was offered by Graham and his colleagues who now believe that the entire\nCarboniferous insect population may have been enabled to fly in an oxygen-rich atmosphere.\nThis hypothesis was proposed by Robert Berner who claimed that \u201cthe atmosphere in the\nCarboniferous was more oxygen rich than at any time before or since\u2014it was 35 percent\n\n28 See here, for imstance, the debate between M.

                "content": "of land plants in generat and in particular to the vast and verdant swamps that characterized\nthe Carboniferous.\u201d32\n\n\u201cAll those swamp plants spit oxygen into the atmosphere, and when they died, they\nescaped the open-air decomposition by bacteria that would have drawn oxygen back\nout of the atmosphere. Instead they sank into the swamps, ultimately forming coal\ndeposits that gave the Carboniferous its name.\u201d33\n\nNever mind that there is no direct evidence of higher atmospheric oxygen levels during\nthe Carboniferous. After all, Berner\u2019s hypothesis is simply based on a computer model. Even\nso, as Shanti Menon explained, the oxygen-rich atmosphere hypothesized by Berner would\nhave made for \u201ca denser atmosphere that provided more lift and thus made it easier for\n[Carboniferous insects] to fly.\u201d34 While this is in keeping with Jueneman\u2019s Pleiongaea, it\nshould be kept in mind that, as Menon was forced to admit, the whole idea is \u201ca hypothesis\nbased on a hypothesis.\u201d35 But then, around 1985, Dale Russell and Parvez Kumar also came\nto the conclusion that Earth\u2019s atmosphere had to have been much denser than at present.\n\nBut is a denser atmospheric envelope really required for the sustenance of life on a planet\nreliant for its heat on a dwarf star? Until recently, such a dense atmosphere around a dwarf\nstar planet had been thought to be detrimental to life since it would prevent the star\u2019s rays\nfrom reaching the planet\u2019s surface and thus inhibiting photosynthesis, \u201ca serious blow for the\ndevelopment of life as we know it.\u201d36 But then, simulation of a red dwarf planet\u2019s\natmosphere conducted by Robert Haberle and Manoj Joshi in the 1990s showed that a thick\nenvelope would not really be required. As they stated, \u201ceven a thin atmosphere would do the\ntrick.\u201d37\n\n\u201cWf the planet had onty 15 per cent as much air as the Earth...that would stiil ferry\nenough heat around to the dark side to keep the atmosphere from freezing out.\u201d38\n\nThe density, or otherwise, of a planet\u2019s atmosphere, however, is relative. Even an atmos-\nphere as dense as that of Venus, which has been blamed for its infernal heat, much denser\nthan that proposed for Earth by the above proponents, is not enough to obstruct the Sun\u2019s\nrays. And if pterodactyls and giant insects really required a denser atmosphere in order to fly\nand navigate, we will accept that. After all, the view that Earth was nestled within proto-Sat-\nurn\u2019s envelope is not incompatible with a denser terrestrial atmosphere.",
