All that needs to be\nre-stated here is that, like Janus, with whom we are presently mainly concerned, the above\nseries of gods were all believed to have represented that entity which the Greeks called\nkosmos and which, among modern mythologists, has come down to symbolize the sky or\nheaven. Using the old adage that things which are equal to the same thing must be equal to\none another, one can therefore assume that, since the deities enumerated above are all, to\nsome extent, identifiable as avatars of the Saturnian deity, then so must Janus be identified.\n\nActually, the above series of identifications has been presented more as an exercise in\ncomparative mythology, and as a basis for coming chapters, than as evidence for the Saturn-\nian identity of Janus since the comparisons are not really required to make our case. As will\nbe seen directly below, we have direct evidence at our disposal.",

As noted earlier, and as has been recognized by others, there is nothing\nstrange about having different deities, even within the same pantheon, as personifying the\nsame celestial object. As far as Janus is concerned, he could be considered an older Saturn\u2014\nCook had no qualms about making him an older Jupiter,3? with which this author naturally\ndisagrees.\n\nTo be fair, since 1 mentioned him, Cook did not accept the statement of Lydus\u2014 bur not\nbecause he considered the source as a late one. \u201cThe confusion of Ianus [the same as Janus}\nwith Kronos,\u201d he tells us, \u201cno doubt presupposes the usual blunder Kronos = Chronos [that is\nTime personified], which from the fifth century B.C. onwards queered the course of Greek\ntheology.\u201d4\u00b0\n\nWhy did Cook bring this point up? He did so because he could not avoid the veneration\nof Janus as a god of time, or Time personified,*! which, through the rules of comparative\nmythology, would equate the Italic deity with the Greek Chronos. But, in the first place, ac-\ncording to Lydus, his countrymen did not call Janus by the name Kronos. They called him by\nthe name Saturnus. The identification with Kronos was added because Kronos was simply\nthe Greek counterpart of the Italic Saturnus. In the second place, as will be indicated in detail\nin a later chapter of this work, the blunder concerning the identification of Kronos/Satum\nwith Chronos/Time happens to be Cook\u2019s. In fact, as we shal! soon see, the identification of\nJanus as Saturn does not rest solely on the statement of Lydus but also on the comparison of\nthis deity\u2019s characteristics with those of the known Saturnian deities of other nations.

I start with the astronomical knowledge of the Dogon of Mali of what had once\nbeen the French Sudan, in Africa.\n\nThanks to the writings of Marcel Griaule, Germaine Dieterlen, and Robert Temple, the\nDogon, once a little-known tribe with some very curious rituals, have now been placed on the\ntourist map. But more than their exotic costumes, bizarre masks, dances, and commemorative\nfestivals, these people have become increasingly renowned for their astronomical lore. As\nEdwin Krupp reported:\n\n\u201cCounting the phases of the moon, keeping track of the configurations of Venus, and\nwatching the arrivals and departures of the stars are all part of Dogon practical as-\ntronomy. The Dogon recognizes 266 stars or asterisms and associate them with 266\npictographic symbols that are painted on rock shelters, altars, and other shrines.\u201d4\n\nThe Moon, say the Dogon, \u201cis dry and dead like dry dead blood.\u2019\u00b0 They know that the\nplanets, which they call tolo tanaze \u2014that is \u201c\u201d>! revolve\naround the Sun. They claim that \u201cJupiter follows Venus by turning slowly around the sun.\u201d52\nThey possess four different kinds of calendar\u2014a solar calendar, a lunar calendar, a Venus\ncalendar, and, remarkably, one based on the star known to us as Sirius.53 Either through in-\ntuition or otherwise, the Dogon are of the belief that an infinite number of stars and an infi-\nnite number of planets, together with their satellites, exist.\n\nWhat mostly interests us here, however, has to do with what they have to say in relation\nto Satu. Concerning this planet, the Dogon \u201caffirm there is a permanent halo around the\nstar, different from the one sometimes seen around the moon.\u201d Their own drawing of Sat-\nurn actually shows the planet, depicted as a circle, distinctly surrounded by a ring. Saturn is\nalso known to them as \u201cthe star of limiting the place,\u201d which probably alludes to the fact\nthat Saturn is the outermost planet among those visible to the naked eye.\n\nAs Krupp was later to admit, these astronomical traditions of the Dogon \u201cwere bound to\ncause consternation among astronomers, for it seems impossible to reconcile the Dogon as-\ntronomical knowledge...with their instrumental resources, namely the unaided eye.\u201d>? While\nGriaule and Dieterlen did not, themselves, come to a definite conclusion concerning how the\nDogon came upon their astronomical lore, Robert Temple, who built an edifice on their\n\n49 E. C.

(It has always fascinated me that such extraterrestri-\nals would have bestowed such astronomical knowledge to the ancestors of the Dogon,\nknowledge which was of no practical use to them, while giving them nothing that might have\nalleviated the precarious living of their Stone Age primitiveness.)\n\nOthers would rather have the Dogon educated in these matters by other sorts of visiting\naliens\u2014Christian missionaries from the West. The missionary campaign in tropical Africa,\nhowever, did not commence in earnest until the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century.\nBut this is neither here nor there because, to be sure, the Sudan, including Mali, had much\nearlier come under the influence of Islam,\u00a9 so that no Christian influence could have pene-\ntrated the region\u2014and this despite the fact that the rural areas, such as the one occupied by\nthe Dogon, continued to stick to their traditional animistic ways.\u00ae! And, in any case, would\nmissionaries, Christian or otherwise, bent on converting primitive peoples to their faith, have\nfilled the minds of these natives with astronomical knowledge? Or why was this knowledge,\nas adhered to by these natives, first reported to the outside world by missionaries who were\nas confounded by the knowledge as were later astronomers?\n\nOne other alternative that has been proposed is that the ancestors of the Dogon had been\nin possession of optical instruments. However, even Galileo, with his pioneering telescope,\nwas not able to see Saturn as a ringed orb. In fact, the image of Saturn that he was capable of\nresolving through his optical instrument was so vague that he mistook the planet for three\nseparate bodies. As he himself reported:\n\n\u201cI have observed with great admiration that Saturn is not a single star but three to-\ngether, which, as it were, touch each other...the middle being much larger than the\nlateral ones...by employing a glass which multiplies the superficies [i.e., visible\nboundaries] more than a thousand times, the three globes will be seen very distinctly\nand almost touching, with only a small dark space between them.\u201d \u00ae\n\nIt was not until 1655 that Christian Huygens, with a better instrument, was able to report\n(through his now famous encoded message) that Saturn was actually \u201cgirdled by a thin flat\nring, nowhere touching, inclined to the ecliptic.\u201d\n\nIs it then probable that the Dogon, who are still living in their primitive mud huts as I\nwrite this, could have been in possession of a better telescope than the one utilized by Gali-\nleo?",

As outlandish as this\nidea may appear, there seems to be no other resolution to the problem\u2014which brings to mind\nthe oft-repeated words of Arthur Conan Doyle: \u201cWhen you have eliminated the impossible,\nwhatever remains, however improbable, has to be the truth.\u201d7!

                "content": "Science has forgotten Oskar Reichenbach who, as far back as 1884, had proposed a the-\nory purporting to prove that land masses on Earth have rifted and moved northward.\u201d His\nideas can therefore be said to have preceded the similar ones of Alfred Wegener, himself rel-\negated to a footnote in the annals of science as the originator of the Continental Drift Theory,\nby some 33 years. But, more than that, Reichenbach was of the belief that, in the past, the So-\nlar System had experienced a series of catastrophic events. Basing his conclusions on the\nimperfect knowledge of his time, he had also formulated certain theories concerning the\nplanet Saturn. As wrong as he might have been, and I am not here concerned with defending\nReichenbach, he hit on the novel idea that Earth is \u201can offspring of Saturn,\u201d74 by which he\nmeant to imply that Earth had once been a satellite of the giant gas planet.\n\nWhether Immanuel Velikovsky was aware of Reichenbach\u2019s wild theory or not must\nremain a moot question but, many years later, he, too, came to the same conclusion. Origi-\nnally, Velikovsky\u2019s Worlds in Collision contained a section on Saturn conceming events that\npredated the ones he described in that work.

                "content": "time, because of the manner in which he was treated by academia, Velikovsky threatened to\ntake his Saturnian thesis with him to the grave but, as matters tured out, reason prevailed\nand he was able to expand and finalize his hypothesis under the title of Saturn and the Flood\nand Jupiter of the Thunderbolt, a title which was later changed to In the Beginning. As of this\nwriting, this work still has to see the light of day.\n\nIn 1971, however, Velikovsky gave a lecture at the University of the New World in\nValais, Switzerland, in which he presented a synopsis of his unpublished Saturnian scenario.\nAmong the items he disclosed there was the hypothesis that Earth might once have been a\nsatellite of Saturn.7> The lecture was later transcribed by Jan Sammer and appeared as an ar-\nticle in KRONOS.\n\nIndependent of Velikovsky, but basing their work on his as also on the mytho-historical\nrecord, Harold Tresman and Berard Newgrosh (writing under the name of Brendan\nO\u2019Gheoghan), also came to the conclusion that Earth must once have orbited Satum as a\nsatellite,\u201d\u2019 a topic to which Tresman was later to return.78\n\nIn analyzing the ambiguous, but tantalizing, planetary system proposed by Philolaos, the\nPythagorean philosopher from Southern Italy who lived in the time of Socrates, Lynn Rose\ncame to the same conclusion. Although this system of Philolaos had long been relegated to\nthe library of Classical curiosities, Rose was able to recapture what it might have once in-\ntended to portray. Although what resulted was a Saturnian scenario the details of which are at\nvariance with the one being presented here, it still contains some of its basic elements. As\nRose explained: \u201cAccording to the conventional interpretation, the system of Philolaos had\nEarth in orbit around a Central Fire...\u201d?9 Since the Sun was described as orbiting this Central\nFire\u00ae\u00b0 it becomes obvious that the Central Fire could not have been the Sun. An in-depth\nstudy of this system, together with his privileged knowledge of Velikovsky\u2019s unpublished\nwork on the subject, enabled Rose to conclude that this Central Fire was Saturn shining as a\n\u201csun,\u201d and that Earth was in those days in orbit around it.8i\n\nCombining Velikovsky\u2019s postulate with that of David Talbott and others, Frederick Hall\nembraced the same idea, presenting it in a speculative scenario concerning the history of the\nSolar System.\u00ae2\n\nCertain fundamentals, based on specific proposals offered by others, are here accepted,\nbut also tested against the record. The hypothesis that Earth had once been a satellite of Sat-\nurn, which originally came to this author via Velikovsky, is one of them. Additional research\nconducted independently by the present author has led to the same conclusion. This research\nhas however made it apparent that prehistoric man, ignorant of astronomical matters, would\nnot have been able to deduce that his world was a satellite of another planet. But, being close\nenough to Saturn, he would have been able to view that planet as something much bigger\nthan the present pin-point of light we see in the night sky. Saturn, in fact, would have loomed\nlarge in the sky as a disk, or sphere, much larger than that of the present full Moon. And this\n\n75 1.

It definitely explains the beliefs of the Dogon of\nMali, as also those of the Efe pygmies of the Ituri forest.\n\nThis, then, together with its radiating brightness , better explains why Saturn was consid-\nered to have been the most prominent among the planets-~which provides us with our next\nnumbered hypothesis. But, rather than numbering this as Hypothesis #3, 1 would like to num-\nber it #1, while reshuffling our previous two hypotheses. What we have at this point then is\nthe following:\n\nHypothesis #1: That, from what can be deduced from ancient as well as primitive astron-\nomical lore, Earth had one been a satellite of the planet Saturn which, because of its proxim-\nity, loomed large in the sky as a distinct disc larger than the size of the full Moon.\n\nHypothesis #2: That, according to the ancients, the planet Saturn once shone as a sun.\n\nHypothesis #3: That, still according to the ancients, this primitive Saturnian sun shone\nduring that time we today call the night.\n\nBut does astronomy, as presently believed in, allow for this state of affairs?\n\n178",
