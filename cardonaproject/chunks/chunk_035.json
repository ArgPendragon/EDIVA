                "content": "The discovery of dominant massive planets in extra-solar systems forced astronomers to\nrevise their theories concerning the formation of solar systems in general. Assigning the\nproblem to computers, simulations conducted by Frederic Rasio and Eric Ford resulted in\nmodels that were catastrophic enough to warm the hearts of Velikovskians.\n\n\u201cIn a system containing two Jupiter-like planets, the possibility exists that a dynami-\ncai instability will develop. Computer simulations suggest that in many cases this in-\nstability leads to the ejection of one planet while the other is left in a smaller, eccen-\ntric, orbit. In extreme cases, the eccentric orbit has a small enough periastron distance\nthat it may circularize at an orbital period as short as a few days through tidal dissipa-\ntion. This may explain the recently detected Jupiter-mass planets in very tight circular\norbits and wider eccentric orbits around nearby stars.\u201d*3\n\nIn turn, this led to new theories concerning the formation of our own Solar System. As\nJosie Glausiusz commented:\n\n\u201c...the detection of extra-solar planets has forced astronomers to re-examine [the the-\nory concerning the formation of our Solar System] because [these planets] present us\nwith a paradox. Many are so monstrous in size, and hug their stars so closely, that\nthey could not have formed in their present positions. The searingly hot stars around\nwhich they circle would have melted their rocky cores before they got started. In-\nstead, it\u2019s assumed that they coalesced some distance away, then barreled inward over\nmillions of years. And if such chaos characterizes the birth of extra-solar planets,\ncould not similar disorder have reigned closer to home?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what astronomers are proposing. Instead of staid and steady motion\nfrom the start, they see turmoil. During the early years of our solar system, they say,\ngiant planets were born, bounced about, swung past one another, and were flung\napart before settling into their present orbits. [It is now suggested] that the massive\nicy planets Uranus and Neptune formed in close proximity to gassy Jupiter and Sat-\nurn, then barged past the behemoths into the far reaches of the solar system...\n\n\u201c[It is now suggested] that the emergence of a Jupiter-sized planet during the early\nyears of a solar system can trigger chaos, birthing punier planets, then ejecting them\nin all directions.\u201d\n\nEven newer theories suggest that an alien star could easily pass by the Solar System and\nthat this could alter Jupiter\u2019s orbit which could then pass so close to Earth that our world\ncould easily be ejected into space or crash into the Sun.*>\n\nIn fact, other theorists are now proposing that the early Solar System might have con-\ntained up to twenty planets in irregular orbits \u201cwhere they were eventually bound to col-\nlide.\u201d\n\n33 FA.

                "content": "Beginning around October 2000, news began circulating that more than half of the so-\ncalled extra-solar planets that had been discovered up to then were not planets at all but,\nrather, brown dwarf stars, double stars, or low-mass stars.59 The reasons for this change of\nmind were variously given by various authorities. It was, for instance, reported that the radial\nvelocity techniques behind the discoveries were inadequate to determine the angle of obser-\nvation which would affect the results concerning the masses involved. As announced by the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\u2019s Allegheny Observatory: \u201cRadial velocity observations cannot dis-\ntinguish between a planet in an orbit that is viewed nearly edge on from a brown dwarf or\nstellar companion in an orbit that is nearly in the plane of the sky.\u201d\n\nUsing astrometric data from the European Space Agency, as well as astral velocity data,\nastrophysicists from the United States and Korea have determined that the orbital inclinations\nof the objects in question are extremely low. In other words, \u201cthe orbital planes of these\ncompanions appear to be oriented nearly face on to the observer.\u201d6! According to David\nBlack of the Lunar and Planetary Institute: \u201cThis contradicts the assumption that the line-of-\nsight angle is random in the radial velocity studies.\u201d\u00ae? Putting it plainly, randomness dictates\nthat some of these objects should be seen edge-on, while others face-on as viewed from our\nangle here on Earth.\n\nAccording to George Gatewood of the Allegheny Observatory:\n\n\u201cPart of the problem arises because masses smaller than that of Jupiter are very diffi-\ncult to detect [outside the Solar System], thus most of the objects that have been de-\ntected and are suspected to be planets have masses greater than that of Jupiter, the\nmost massive planet in our solar system. Until very recently, there were few known\nobjects between one Jupiter in mass and 80 times as much, and those are all small\nstars.\u201d63\n\n57, p. 19.\n\n58 Ibid.\n\n%?

On the other hand, Marcy had a good argument. As he and others have pointed out,\nfour of the companions which Black and his team had investigated are said to orbit their pri-\nmaries \u201cwithin one degree of perfect alignment with the line of sight.\u201d6\n\n\u201cYet the chance of any single partner of a given mass having that orientation is about\n1 in 5,000. Conversely, for every partner with that orientation, there should be 5,000\nor so with less extreme orientation. No such bodies are seen. Marcy is so convinced\nthat he says Scientific American \u2018will be doing science a bum steer\u2019 simply by men-\ntioning Black\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nBut then, Tsevi Mazeh and Shay Zucker weighed in from Tel Aviv University with the\nsuggestion that \u201cthe truth lies somewhere in the middle.\u201d Concerning the four companions\ninvestigated by Black, they claim that two of them do indeed \u201chave the heft of a star.\u201d The\nother two, according to them, do not.\u00ae\n\nOthers suspect that the analyses \u201chave fallen prey to subtle computational biases,\u201d and\nthat \u201cit is quite plausible that searchers have unwittingly skewed their sample,\u201d and that\nhigher precision astrometry as well as other methods are needed to resolve the debate.\n\nEventually, even Marcy was forced to give an inch when the then newly discovered outer\ncompanion to yet another star was estimated to be \u201cbetween 17 and 40 times\u201d the mass of\nJupiter. As Marcy was reported to have admitted, \u201c[this one] seems too large for a conven-\ntional planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe frankly don\u2019t know what name to give it!\u201d Marcy said. \u2018Is it a planet or brown\ndwarf...?

Anything over that is to be termed a brown dwarf star.72 Others decided that objects\nless than 13 times the mass of Jupiter should be classified as planets, while those between 13\nand 75 Jupiter masses should be termed brown dwarf stars. In other words, the dilemma\nwas temporarily, and arbitrarily, alleviated by invoking nomenclature.\n\na G.

Their masses have been\nestimated to be eight times that of Jupiter.

Using spectrometers, which measure visible and invisible energy alike,\nZapatero-Osorio\u2019s team \u201cactually saw the objects they describe.\u201d\u00ae\u00b0\n\nAs with Phil Lucas, and despite her belief that these bodies would have had to have been\nformed independently, Zapatero-Osorio did not rule out the possibility that they may have\nbeen ejected from other systems containing stars around which they would have originally\norbited.%\n\nThe eighteen lone travelers through space soon rose to twenty five; and the theorized ex-\nistence of hundreds of others soon rose to hundreds of millions of footloose planets wander-\ning through the Milky Way.?!\n\nWhat is perhaps more important to our own study, however, is Firsoff's conclusion in re-\nlation to these lonesome planets. \u201cIn the absence of the ionising radiation of the star,\u201d he\nwrote, \u201c[such planets} should be able to retain more extensive atmospheres, and, while ter-\nrestrial planets of this kind would be very cold, large [JJovian or sub-[Jjovian masses may\nhave enough internal heat to allow any type of life, even based on our carbohydrate chemis-\ntry, to develop on their surfaces.\u201d9?\n\nAlthough we shall probably never know whether Saturn and Earth are bodies that escaped\nfrom another solar system, we have seen that such liberated planets are considered to be\nwithin the realm of possibility. Planets traveling alone through space have now become quite\ncommon. There is, therefore, nothing impossible about Earth having traveled together with\nSaturn through the cold realms of space before they came within the grips of our present Sun.\n\nAs Firsoff admitted, Jovian and even sub-Jovian masses may retain enough internal heat\nto allow life to develop and sustain itself. Our own hypothesis differs only slightly from this\nin that it was Saturn\u2019s heat which allowed the existence of life on Earth. True, Saturn is less\nmassive than Jupiter and, at its present mass, falls short of the requirements for it to be con-\nsidered a brown dwarf star since, as we have seen, such stars have masses ranging from about\n15 to 80 times that of Jupiter.\u00b0? However, it has been ascertained that \u201cbrown dwarfs bridge\nthe entire gap between stars and planets,\u201d with low-mass candidates being more numerous\nthan high-mass ones, \u201cand this trend continues down nearly to planetary masses.\u201d\u00b04 It has\neven been conjectured that \u201cthe masses of brown dwarfs and planets can actually overlap\neach other!\u201d95 Besides, as I intend to show in the proposed sequel to this volume, there is\nteason to believe that, as a brown dwarf star, proto-Saturn was once more massive.\n\nIt is now believed that there are twice as many brown dwarfs as there are \u201creal\u201d stars.\u00b0\u00b0\nMoreover, it has been found out that \u201cfar more brown dwarfs float freely than orbit stars.\u201d97\nIt has additionally been conjectured that one of them \u201cmight even be stirring up the Oort\n\n89 Ibid.\n\n% Ibid.\n\n91H.

                "content": "The myths we have so far enumerated may therefore be seen as constituting man\u2019s col-\njective memory of that ancient time when Earth, in the company of its celestial primary, was\ntraveling through the blackness of outer space, far from the Sun, illuminated feebly by Sat-\nurn\u2019s meager glow, but basking in the warmth of that primeval giant which was, from time\nimmemorial, the first\u2014and for a while the only\u2014-god man knew.\n\nCan the mytho-historical record further support this wild contention?\n\nPrimitive man would not have known that he was living outside our Solar System. Of\nsolar systems and brown dwarf stars\u2014even of planets, per se\u2014he knew nothing. All that he\ncould /ater recollect was that the Sun had been absent during the earliest times he could re-\nmember. I believe we have supplied enough of man\u2019s ancient memory concerning that period\nin previous pages. Here I will merely add two snippets concerning Raven, Raven Boy, and\nWanadi, simply because we had already had something different to relate concerning these\nmythological entities.\n\nThus, among the Eskimos it is told how Raven Boy absconded with the sun but that, at\nhis father Raven\u2019s behest, he \u201cset the sun back in its old place so that light once more re-\nturned to the earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it was not the unremitting light of former days, for Raven Boy feared that if the\npeople forgot the terrors of darkness, they would forget also Raven\u2019s teaching. With a\nsweep of a wing, he sent the sky spinning round the earth, carrying the sun with it and\nin this way day and night were created.\u201d100\n\nWhat this tells us is that the sun which Raven Boy absconded with was one that shed an\n\u201cunremitting light,\u201d which hints at a sun that neither rose nor set. This, then, would have al-\nluded to the immobile Saturnian sun. The sun he set back in place, on the other hand, was\none that went \u201cround the earth\u201d \u2014in other words, our present Sun.\n\nThe Makiritare of Venezuela, whom we have also met on a previous page, revered Wa-\nnadi as he \u201cwho shines in the highest heaven.\u201d !\u00b0! But since, as we have already seen, this\nWanadi was said to have been \u201clike a sun that never sets,\u201d 02 we have every reason to believe\nthat the reference is to the once immobile Saturnian sun. The light from this Wanadi was said\nto have eventually failed from coming down anymore. And that is why, the Makiritare say,\n\u201cthe new Wanadi made this sun for us, to make it light for us during the day.\u201d And: \u201cWhen\nthe new Wanadi came, it dawned again.\u201d 1\n\n%8 5, B.

We must, therefore, reserve such records for their proper\nplace in the chronology of Saturnian events we are here attempting to reconstruct. What is of\nadditional interest is that, in a strange sort of way, the absence of the Sun, and its eventual\n\u201cbirth,\u201d continues to be commemorated to the present day in an ancient Peruvian ritual\nwhich, in time, gained Catholic overtones.\n\nThe ritual in question takes place in June high in the Andes where thousands of cele-\nbrants congregate from highland villages and towns to participate. What these people gather\nto observe is the feast of Qoyllur Rit\u2019: which, in Quechua, means the \u201cStar of the Snow,\u201d !+\nan annual festival rooted deep in Inca heritage. Wending their way in a long procession to a\nholy site three miles above the sea, the pilgrims cross gorges and mountain slopes by moon-\nlight to hold a festival commemorating the miraculous appearance of the child Jesus to a\nyoung herdsman named Mariano in these mountains two centuries ago. !\u00a9 Today, the shrine\nof the Star of the Snow contains a rock bearing the image of the Christian Jesus. The pre-\nColumbian roots of the ritual are however acknowledged by many anthropologists and, in\n\n1047 he connection of the Star of the Snow with Saturn will have to await a future work.\n105R.
