Melvin Cook, however, is of a different opinion. Ac-\ncording to his findings, Antarctica \u201cappears not to have moved appreciably in continental\nshift\u201d since the continents which were once in contact with it \u201cleft Antarctica in radial\ndirections,\u201d thus jeaving it more or less in the same locality. Besides, as we have seen, the\nproblem also involves the Arctic regions where, even according to orthodoxy, continental\ndrift cannot save the day. But the enigma entails more than just Earth\u2019s polar regions; it also\nembraces the latitudes in between. Thus, from early in the twentieth century, many\npaleobotanists were convinced that \u201cduring by far the greater portion of time since the Azoic\nera, mild, benign climatic conditions have existed.\u201d\u201d According to Dolph Hooker:\n\n\u201cIt is also the concensus [sic.] that, astonishingly and inexplicably, such conditions\nwere comparatively uniform over most of Earth\u2019s surface; that temperate climate\nextended both north and south to within the polar circles. It is also believed that,\namazingly, seasonal effects during most of geological time have been much less pro-\nnounced than they are now.\u201d\n\nWriting in 1912, F. H.

Christopher\nScotese, a geologist, now predicts that, in another 250 million years, Great Britain will have\nbeen pushed to a near-Arctic locale, with the Atlantic Ocean having become nothing but a\ndistant memory. Just as all land masses are believed to have been joined together, 250 mil-\nlion years ago, in a super-continent which geologists have named Pangaea, a new mega-con-\ntinent, already dubbed Pangaea Ultima, will by then have formed. Africa would have\nrammed Europe, uplifting the colliding edges in a Himalaya-like mountain range while eras-\ning the Mediterranean in the process. The Atlantic Ocean would first widen, then reverse its\ncourse and finally close up completely.\u201d\n\nIt is not, therefore, surprising that geologists and paleoclimatologists have tended to rely\non this process to account for the moving of once-tropical areas into what are now the Arctic\nand Antarctic regions. As noted in the above report, Great Britain seems destined to do ex-\nactly that. As we have seen, however, continental drift cannot be made to account for the\nsub-tropical fauna and flora of the Tertiary period, the remains of which are now found\nwithin the Arctic Circle, for the simple reason that the Arctic regions were already close to\ntheir present location at the time.

As Richard Kerr noted:\n\n\u201cThe earth of the Cretaceous Period 100 million years ago was unaccountably warm,\nas it generally had been since the end of the last great ice age 140 million years ear-\nfier...\u201d\u201d\n\n\u201cExplaining Cretaceous climate has been difficult because it differed so from today\u2019s.\nCoral reefs for which warm water is essential ranged as much as 1500 kilometers\ncloser to the poles than they do today, as did nonseasonal land plants. Deep ocean\nwater that now hovers near freezing was 15\u00b0 warmer...Alligators and croco-\ndiles seem to have thrived at latitudes as far north as that of present-day Labrador.\nAnd there is no evidence of any permanent ice like that which today deeply buries\nAntarctica and Greenland.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only was it generally warmer during the Cretaceous, but it was particularly\nwarmer in the polar regions.\"\n\nBecause the position of the continents during the Cretaceous would have been different\nfrom the locales they would have occupied later during the Tertiary, scientists continued to\nseek an answer to the riddle of the earlier climate via continental drift. This was not only be-\ncause the lands within the present Arctic Circle would have been farther removed from polar\nregions than they would have been during the following Tertiary, but also because the\ndifferent continental configuration would have led to the development of an entirely different\nclimatic regime. It was thus reasoned that:\n\n\u201cContinents bunched in low latitudes near the equator, as Cretaceous continents\ntended to be, would allow warm ocean currents to carry heat poleward. High-latitude\npolar oceans, being less reflective than land, would also absorb more heat and further\nmoderate climate.\u201d\u201d\n\nEric Barron and Warren Washington therefore decided to test this hypothesis by recreat-\ning the Cretaceous climate through the use of a computer model. Others followed suit.\u201d\nThere is no point in tracing the ups and downs of these various attempts and the\ndisagreements between them.

This evidence comes from tree rings. As every Boy Scout knows, tree\ntrunks are marked out in transverse section into concentric rings, one ring for each \u201cseason\u201d\nof growth. In order to tell the age of a felled tree, Boy Scouts are taught to count the number\nof rings laid out in its trunk. Known as annular rings, these growth marks owe their emer-\ngence to differences in the elements at the beginning and end of each growing period.\n\nFossilized trees from various past ages show distinct annular rings. Others do not. Wood.\nretrieved from late Paleozoic deposits in the southern hemisphere has been said to show\npronounced ring growths. So, also, fossils of deciduous trees from the Cretaceous. In fact,\nfossilized wood samples ranging all the way from the Devonian to the Eocene have been\nclaimed to show well marked annular rings. The scientific literature on this subject, however,\nis very ambiguous. More recent work has tended to show that rings are either lacking or very\nweak in all known specimens from the Devonian period which seems to indicate a non-sea-\nsonal environment. Most fossil trees from the Carboniferous period, which followed the De-\nvonian, also lack rings. As Elso Barghoorn noted:\n\n\u201cOne impressive indicator of uniform climate over great areas of the Carboniferous\ncontinents is the great absence of annual growth rings in coal-swamp trees. The entire\nquestion of ring development in woody plants is one fraught with botanical variables\nas well as climatic variables. However, the consistent absence of any index of sea-\nsonal growth seems difficult to explain except on the assumption that winter cold and\nseasonality of rainfall were absent or at a minimum.\u201d\n\nBy the time we come to the late Permian period, still within the Paleozoic era, we end up\nwith a mixed bag. Fossil woods from Canada, Europe, and Asia have weak or non-existent\nrings, while those from South America, Africa, and Antarctica show prominent and wide\ngrowth rings. A mixed bag from trees growing in different areas may be expected. But what\nabout a similar mixed bag from trees known to have grown in the same locality?

In samples from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods of the same\nMesozoic era, as well as from the Early Tertiary period, tree rings range from prominent to\nnon-existent, depending on the paleolatitude in which they are claimed to have thrived.\nWhen it comes to polar fossil plants, as Edward Berry noted: \u201cDetailed comparisons of\nthese Arctic floras with contemporary floras from lower Jatitudes...show unmistakable\nevidence for the existence of climatic zones...\u201d\u201d C. P.

And, because\nthe darker latewood added at the end of the growing season featured very narrow bands, the\nconclusion has been drawn that the trees grew rapidly during the twenty-four hour sunshine\nperiod of the Arctic summer and then closed up shop during the winter hours of darkness.\u201d\nThe problem with this, however, is that trees would not have survived such prolonged\nperiods of darkness.

All of which forces us to ask yet another ques-\ntion: Are annular rings really indicative of seasonality?\n\nActually, annular rings are only formed in those plants whose growth is interrupted by a\nregular winter or dry \u201cseason.\u201d The increment of new wood formed in these trees is marked\nby a distinct line which is produced by the contrast between the late summer of one year and\nthe spring of the next. The lines of separation between successive rings marks the limit of a\nmicroscopically thin layer of cells, known as the cambium, which lies between the wood and\nthe bark, at the end of each successive growth period. The bark then cracks and/or expands to\nallow for the new growth of wood, and the tree trunk is thus thickened. It should be noted,\nhowever, that the cambium responds mainly to conditions of temperature and rainfall rather\nthan the incidence of light.\n\nIn temperate climates, the cambium produces new wood only during spring and early\nsummer. It becomes inactive during autumn and winter. But what about trees growing in\ntropical and equatorial regions where seasonal differences disappear? Do they still grow\nrings? As it happens, many kinds of evergreen tropical trees do not grow rings.\u2122 But others\ndo. As Barghoorn reported: \u201cIn existing woody plants, annual ring development may occur\nunder nearly uniform climatic conditions, as in equatorial rainforests.\u201d What, then, is it in\nthis seasonless environment that tells these trees that a year has passed and that it is time to\ngrow more wood and thus form a new ring?\n\nThat the growth of annular rings is not tied to seasonal change is evidenced by the fact\nthat some trees have been known to grow as much as three or four rings in one year. Nor is\nthis an uncommon situation, as Nelson Glueck noted, especially in trees which grow on\nsloping ground that tums wet and dry several times in one year because of rapid outflow of\nwater.\u201d> According to an item in Nature magazine, multiple rings in larch trees were normal\nin 1919; in fact, larches seem to be prone to multiple ring growth.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, trees which miss growing a ring in certain years have also been known.\u201d As\nHerbert Sorensen pointed out:\n\n\u201cIn dry and climatically harsh years, no detectable growth may occur. In this case no\nring is formed and the ring is missing for that season of the year.\u201d\u201d\n\n% 1.

                "content": "rings are lacking in a majority of trees which thrive in subtropical and tropical climates while\nothers fail to grow rings regardless of climate.\n\nWhat all of this declares is that tree rings are poor indicators of seasonal change. In fact,\nlet us be honest about it, they are not indicative of seasonal change at all. But if tree rings do\nnot indicate seasonal change, what, then, do they indicate?\n\nWe have already noted above that the cambium responsible for the growth of trees re-\nsponds mainly to conditions of temperature and rainfall rather than the incidence of light.\nAnd, in fact, when it comes to the growth rate of trees, water is the limiting factor. In other\nwords, water is the one true constituent which limits the growth of cambium and thus the\nformation of growth rings. This is what tree rings, when they grow at all, truly indicate\u2014a\ncycle dictated by the availability and cessation of an adequate water supply \u2014which is pro-\nbably what Ian Johnson meant by \u201cordinary seasonal growth cycle\u201d as opposed to \u201ca polar\nseasonality.\u201d Only in the most indirect way can tree rings be said to indicate seasonal change\nwhen they do so at all.\n\nThat being the case, the lower incidence of light from the Satummian sun, as compared to\nthe higher incidence from our present Sun, would have posed no obstacle to the growth of\ntrees. Temperature would also have posed no problem because, while the Satumian sun\nwould not have been as hot as our present Sun, its proximity to Earth would have compen-\nsated for its lower caloric output.\n\nAs we have seen, it is quite apparent that trees grow rings, or fail to grow rings,\nregardless of seasonal change or stability. More importantly, if trees can, as they do, grow\nrings in tropical and equatorial regions in which there is no appreciable seasonal change,\nwhat is so problematic with having trees growing rings in a sub-tropical Arctic which\nenjoyed but one spring-like season?\n\nPaleobotanists remain hard-put to account for the growth of sub-tropical forests and the\nexistence of sub-tropical animals within the Arctic Circle. Uniform heat and light, to say\nnothing of the absence of an ice cover, would have been required for the flourishing of such\nforests and the thriving of such animals,",

But, as James Croll pointed out: \u201cA continent ten times\nthe size of Europe elevated two miles would do little more than bring London to the latitude\nof Edinburgh, or Edinburgh to the latitude of London.\u201d!\u201d\n\nThis debate involved some of the giants of science that lived at the time, including\n, George Darwin, Simon Newcomb, and\nGiovanni Schiaparelli,'\u201d the latter of whom wrote:\n\n\u201cThe permanence of the geographical poles in the very same regions of the earth can-\nnot yet be considered as incontestably established by astronomical or mechanical ar-\nguments. Such permanence may be a fact today, but it remains a matter still to be\nproven for the preceding ages of the history of the globe.\u201d\"\u2122\n\nTo which he added:\n\n\u201cThe possibility of great shifting of the pole is an important element in the discussion\nof prehistoric climates and the distribution, geographic and chronologic, of ancient\norganisms. If this possibility is admitted, it will open new horizons for the study of\ngreat mechanical revolutions that the crust of the earth underwent in the past.\u201d!>\n\nAnd:\n\n\u201cOur problem, so important from the astronomical and mathematical standpoint,\ntouches the foundations of geology and paleontology: its solution is tied to the most\ngrandiose events in the history of the earth.\u201d!*\n\n\u201cThus, finally,\u201d as Immanuel Velikovsky wrote in 1955, \u201can eminent astronomer, after a\nthorough examination of the problem, went over to the side of the geologists.\u201d!\u201d But then, as\nVelikovsky also pointed out, Schiaparelli had only reasoned in a circle by claiming that \u201cthe\ngeological changes would cause the terrestrial poles to move from their places, and the\nmotion of the poles from their places would cause geological and climatal changes.\u201d\"\u2122\n\n1!, p. 313.\n\n1, p. 5.\n\n\"8, pp.\n111-117.\n\n G, V.
