After all, unlike the Sun and Moon, to the\nunaided eye the planets appear no more than small flickering pin-points of light lost amid a\nstarry sea among a multitude of other flickering pin-points of light.\n\nThe ancient Greeks deified all of the heavenly bodies of the Solar System that were, and\nstill are, visible to the naked eye. Saturn was Kronos who was once king of heaven. Jupiter\nwas Zeus who, as in the case of other planetary pantheons, seized the kingdom of the gods\nfrom his father Kronos/Saturn. Mars was known as Ares, the blood-thirsty god of war.\nAphrodite, the goddess of love, perhaps the most popular of the Greek deities, was the\npersonification of Venus. The planet Mercury was Hermes, with his winged sandals, the\nswiftest god among the Olympians.\n\nThese planetary identifications were even adopted by those ancient peoples who came\ninto direct contact with the Greeks. Thus, in The Book of the Secrets of Enoch, a Graeco-\nJewish work from the intertestamental period, the names of the planets are so given in Greek:\nKruno for Kronos/Saturn; Zeus for Jupiter; Aris for Ares/Mars; Aphrodit for\nAphrodite/Venus; and Ermis for Hermes/Mercury.\u2019\"\n\nCan it however be said that, in the minds of the Greeks, planets and gods were\nsynonymous? I pose this all-important question because critics have often denied this to have\nbeen the case. My answer is that the identity of the ancient gods as planets should never even\nhave been questioned. The only acceptable assertion in this matter is that of those very\npeople who once believed in, and venerated, these gods. Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha\nvon Dechend recognized this truth when they wrote:\n\n\u201cThe most \u2018ancient treasure\u2019 ... left to us by our predecessors ... was the idea that the\ngods are really stars, and that there are no others. The forces reside in the starry\nheavens, and all stories, characters and adventures narrated by mythology\nconcentrate on the active powers among the stars, who are the planets.\u201d\n\nThis is quite a claim, to say the least, when one remembers that, at the very dawn of\ncivilization, the Sumerian list of deities already contained more than five thousand names\nwith which to reckon'*\u2014think about it! Accepting that most of these names constitute\nnothing but a litany of epithets bestowed on a much shorter list of deities, the deities\nthemselves, and the tales told about them, remain quite numerous. And yet, as we shall see,\nthis was not merely a case of epithets, for the deities themselves were often inadvertently\nduplicated, triplicated, and so forth.\n\nOn the other hand, to maintain that ai/ mythological characters reduce to a handful of\nplanets, and that aii mythological tales are descriptive of planetary motions, is not, in my\nopinion, a defensible position. After all, in the end, man found it expedient to recognize\ndivinity in just about everything, creating deities who would lord it over such concepts as\nbirth, health, sleep, and death and a thousand other issues to boot. Even so, I will maintain\nthat if we restrict ourselves to the world\u2019s major myths, de Santillana and von Dechend\u2019s\nclaim can be validated.\n\n\u201851 1] Enoch, XXX:4, (NOTE: The difference in the spelling of the names is merely due to different transcription\nfrom the Greek.)\n\n12 G_ de Santillana & H. von Dechend, Hamlet's Mill: An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time (Boston,\n1969), p. 177.\n\n189 FG.

When Solon visited Egypt, he was\ninformed that \u201cneither he nor any other Hellene knew anything worth mentioning about the\ntimes of old.\u201d\"\u201d He was told that \u201cthere is no old opinion handed down among you [Greeks]\nby ancient tradition, nor any science which is hoary with age.\u201d\"\u00ae The Greeks, according to\nthe Egyptian sages, knew \u201cnothing of what happened in ancient times\u201d\u2122 and_ this,\nsupposedly, was due to the survivors of previous natural catastrophes who, for whatever\nreason, had left \u201cno written record\u201d behind them.'*\n\nThe gods\u2019 eventual disassociation from the planets was also abetted by the fact that, like\nother nations, the Greeks were wont to allude to the planets by a different set of names when\ndealing with astronomical, as opposed to cosmogonical, matters. Thus, as indicated by\nBurnet above, we come across Saturn, who was Kronos, being referred to as Phaenon;\nJupiter, who was Zeus, as Phaethon; and so forth. It should be noted, however, that these\nastronomical terms were not themselves devoid of mythic characteristics\u2014so that even in\npurely astronomical treatises, it was difficult to disassociate the study of planets from that of\nthe gods.\n\n\u20187, p. 23.\n488 G, de Santillana & H. von Dechend, foc. cit.\n\n*\u00b0 Plato, Timaeus 22.\n\n18 Thid.\n\n181 Tbid., 23.\n\n1\u00b0 Ibid.\n\n55",

Besides, he was not the only one to offer the assertion. Others\nmaintained and voiced identical opinions.\n\nAmong the Greeks, Lucian of Samosata also knew this truth.\" Thus he tells us that\n\u201cfrom both Homer the poet and the epics of Hesiod we should understand that the ancients\nwere of one mind with the astrologers,\u201d and that it is \u201cthe conjunction of Venus and Mars\u201d\nthat \u201ccreates the poetry of Homer.\u201d'* Plato, who recognized the same truth on his own, had\nit verified by the Egyptians.\u2018\n\nThe Romans, who, in their turn, borrowed many of their deities from the Greeks, were no\ndifferent. It is in fact to them that we owe the present names of the planets in the western\nworld so that, to this day, the planets still bear the names of the gods.\n\nKronos became Saturnus, the god of civilization. Zeus became luppiter, Diespiter, or\nsimply lovis, and, like his counterparts throughout the world, was considered king of all the\ngods. Ares became Marspiter, also known as Mavors\u2014pronounced Ma-oors\u2014or Marmar, a\ngod of war as blood-thirsty as his Greek counterpart. Aphrodite became Venus, retaining ber\nposition as the queen of Jove and feminine beauty. Hermes became Mirqurius, or Mercurius,\nand was honored as the god of merchandise.\n\nThe synonymy of planets with gods was so entrenched among the Romans that Cicero\ndenied the possibility of planetary orbital changes simply because he believed such changes\nto be contrary to the planets\u2019 divine nature.\u201d\n\nThis belief, that the gods were really deified astronomical bodies, even touched primitive\npeoples. Thus the name of the great Polynesian god, Ta\u2019urua, simply means \u201cstar\u201d '*\u2014and\nhere we cannot help but note the similarity of this name to that of Tara, an epithet of\nKali/Durga, mentioned earlier, which also means \u201cstar,\u201d even though no etymological con-\nnection between the two names has yet come to light. In old records of Tahiti, the name\nTa\u2019urua is applied to Fomathaut, a star in the constellation Pisces; to Orion\u2019s belt; to Al-\nphard or Cor Hydra; Betelgeuse; Canopus in the constellation Argo; Deneb in Cygnus; and\nSirius. Each particular star was then identified by a clarifying epithet added to the name\nTa\u2019urua.\u2019\u201d The same name, however, was also applied to the planets Jupiter and Venus. The\nformer was designated Ta\u2019urua-o-rai\u2019i-taetae\u2019a-o-Havai\u2019i-i-te-tua and the latter as Ta\u2019urua-e-\nhiti-Matavai.\"\u201d\n\nAmong the Skidi branch of the Pawnee Indians of North America, there were some who,\nin a sense, might be considered to have been astronomers. These men compiled star maps;\nidentified the constellations and the brightest stars among them; noted the planets and\nrecorded their movements. The beginning of the Pawnee ceremonial year was co-ordinated in\nrites.\u201d As G. A.
