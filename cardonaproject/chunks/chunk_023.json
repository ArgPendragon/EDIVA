Easily coming to mind are such cities as Beth-\naven, Beth-El, Bethlehem, Beth-haran, Bethshemesh, Beth-horon, Beth-,\nBeth-peor, Beth-shan, and many others. Lewy himself explains such place names as due to\nthe one-time existence of sanctuaries each of which was dedicated to the deity there named.\nThus, Jerusalem would have been referred to as Beth Shulman because a temple of Shulman\nwould have existed there.\n\nLewy\u2019s conclusion was that a temple of Shulman supplanted an earlier one dedicated to\nShalim but that it did not last for long. During the same period, the name of the city changed\nfrom Urusalim to Bet Shulman; but, with the destruction of the Shulman temple, the name of\nthe city reverted back to Urusalim. This would explain why the name Bet Shulman never be-\ncame popular.\u00b0\u00b0\n\nNeedless to say, this was all conjecture on Lewy\u2019s part. For one thing, Lewy himself ac-\n were slightly different versions of the same deity,>! so\nthat no replacement of sanctuaries need enter the picture. Nor need the name Bet Shulman\nhave ever supplanted that of Urusalim since, in effect, the meaning of both names is theolog-\nically, even if not philologically, synonymous\u2014the former meaning \u201cHouse of Shulman,\u201d\nthe latter, as we have seen, \u201cFounded by Shalim.\u201d>2 It is thus more than possible that Bet\nShulman was merely another designation for Urusalim, the one derived from Assyrian,\nthe other from Chaldean sources. The Chaldean name passed into Hebrew; the Assyrian did\nnot. The one became popular; the other not.\n\n; referred to as having\n;; it re-\nmains obvious that the city we call Jerusalem was named in honor and dedicated to the god\nShalem/Shulman.*3\n\nIndications that this god was worshipped there can be traced at least to the time of Israel\u2019s\n\nUnited Monarchy.* Also rendered Shulman or Shulmanu,\u00b0 this god\u2019s name gave Jedidiah,\nson of David and king of Israel, his more popular name of Solomon. Rendered Shlomoh in\nHebrew, this monarch\u2019s name has also been stated to have been derived from shalom, which,\nas everyone knows, does, inter alia, mean \u201cpeace.\u201d (Compare also the Arabic salam and\nMaltese s/iema.) The probability, however, is that both the monarch\u2019s name and the word for\n\u201cpeace\u201d\nmeans \u201cbelonging to Salim\u201d5?\n\nBiblical theophoric names derived from Shalem are common including the names of\nkings of Israel and Judah.

In two of these letters which Egyptologists\nhave numbered 74 and 290, reference is made to a place which transliterators have rendered\ndifferently. In 1915, J. Knudtzon settled on the reading of this place as Bet Ninib\u00ae\u2014i.e.,\nHouse of Ninib.\n\nSome time later, in 1940, Julius Lewy re-read the name of this place as Bit Shui-\nmanu\u2014 of Shulman.\u201d\n\nWilliam Albright did not accept Lewy\u2019s transliteration, claiming that the ideogram which\nhe read as \u201cShulmanu\u201d did not incorporate the determinative for divinity.\u201d\n\nIn 1969, the team of Tadmor and Kalai re-read the ideogram again, this time as Beth Nin-\nurta.\nWhich, then, was the correct reading?\n\nThis problem has given birth to many a debate,\u201d but it should never have done so. Let me\nsay that Knudtzon was perfectly correct in reading the name as Bet Ninib since the cuneiform\nideogram which \u201cspells\u201d the name of the god in question is \u201cNIN.IB. Of that, there never was\nany doubt\" As pointed out in an earlier chapter of this work, Ninib, sometimes rendered\nNinip and/or Nirig, was the planetary god Saturn.\u201d\n\nThe reason behind Lewy\u2019s re-reading of the name as Shulman may not appear clear to the\nuninitiated. Suffice it to say that cuneiform characters can be read ideographically and/or\nphonetically. Thus the ideogram \u201cNIN.IB can also be read \u2018Ninurta\u00ae\u2014which means that\n\n% J, A.

Just as \u201cNIN.IB can be read as \u2018Ninurta, so also can \u201cDILMES be\nread as *Shulmanu.\u00ae It therefore follows that, like Ninib/Ninurta, with whom he was\nequated, Shulman was simply an alias of the planetary god Saturn.\n\nFrom this it can be seen that all three readings\u2014Bet Ninib, Beth Ninurta, and Bit Shul-\nmanu -\u2014are correct. They all mean the same thing: \u201c of Saturn.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Albright was entirely wrong when he claimed that the name Shulman\ndid not incorporate the determinative for divinity. The name Shulman, as it appears in el-\nAmarna letter 290, does incorporate the determinative \u2014dingir\u2014for divinity.

Thus, in Akkadian, Ninurta was styled kaimanu, that\nis \u201cthe steady star.\u201d\n\n(For those in the know: The association of Shulman with Resheph, like that of Ninurta\nwith Nergal, will be discussed in a future work.)",

Here, Wallis\nBudge informs us that the \u201cexact attributes\u201d of this deity \u201cappear to have been unknown even\nto the Egyptians.\u201d\u201d And yet, he had no difficulty in deriving the god\u2019s name from the word\nenen, or nen, which means \u201cinertness, inactivity, rest, motionless,\u201d and the like\u201d Despite\nBudge, what this really telis us is that Tenen was considered to be without motion.

Nen, for instance, means \u201cto rise,\u201d often used in relation to a celestial body, but it also\nmeans \u201cto shine.\u201d\"\u2122 More than that, as we have just seen, nen also carries the meanings \u201cin-\nertness, inactivity, rest,\u201d and \u201cmotionless.\u201d Khaut signifies the \u201crising of a god,\u201d but also\n\u201cappearance, splendor, radiance, or brilliance of a god.\u201d\"\u2122 Skhai means \u201cto make to rise up,\u201d\nbut also \u201cto appear.\u201d \u201c\u201d When it comes to the rising of the very Ra in question, one word that\nis often used is kha or khai, meaning \u201cto rise\u201d or \u201cto ascend,\u201d but also \u201cto shine\u201d or \u201cto ap-\npear.\u201d '\u00ae,'\u201c, and\nun.\n\nAs for \u201csetting,\u201d there is an Egyptian word\u2014urt\u2014which has been rendered as meaning\njust that, but it is only used for \u201cthe setting of a star.\u201d\"! On the other hand, a related\nword\u2014urt-t\u2014actually means \u201cimmobility,\u201d while Urt refers to \u201ca motionless god.\u201d'\u201d\n\nEgyptologists who have translated such phrases as \u201cO thou who risest in the horizon as\nRa\u201d did so because the words \u201cO thou who shines in the lightland\u201d made little sense. On the\nother hand, and in face of the fact that Ra is often described as having been motionless, trans-\nlators should have kept these additional meanings in mind. A motionless god, or celestial\nbody, that rises and sets is an impossibility. A god, or celestial body, that shines without\nmovement is not. Thus, As David Talbott indicated, the god does not rise or set but comes\nforth and recedes, that is he grows bright, be shines, and he dims.'?",

As Rose then tells us:\n\n\u201cHistorians of philosophy are fond of referring to the \u2018dark sayings\u2019 of Heraclitus. If\nHeraclitus was at times reflecting back to conditions during the Age of Kronos, per-\nhaps we are now in a position to understand some of his mysterious remarks. The\n; this\nmay be why Heraclitus asks, \u2018How can anyone hide from that which never sets?\u201d\u201d!\u201d\n\nAs Rose continues:\n\n\u201cEven some of the Philolaos fragments, although their authenticity has been ques-\ntioned, make more sense now We are also told that \u2018it [the Central Fire] is ruler and\nteacher of all things; it is God, One ever-existing, stable, unmoving, itself like to it-\nself, different from the rest,\u2019 and that it \u2018remains One for ever in the same position\nand condition\u2019 .\u201d\u201d\n\nGreek knowledge of the immobile Saturnian sun, however, was not restricted to the\n\u201cgarbled\u201d version of Philolaos. In his evaluation of the Greek Helios and other so-called an-\ncient sun-gods, E. A. Butterworth also came to the conclusion that this luminary \u201cis not the\nnatural sun of heaven, for it neither rises nor sets, but is, as it seems, ever at the zenith...\u201d!\u201d\n\nSo similarly from other parts of the world. For example, in Roman tradition, among the\npoets, Saturn was remembered as the god of \u201cthe steadfast star.\u201d\n\nThe Incas, too, preserved a memory of a sun-god\u2014a resting one, to be sure\u2014who was\nable \u201cto light the world from one spot.\u201d We can therefore be assured that when the\nMakiritare of the Upper Orinoco River, in Venezuela, teil us that their god Wanadi was \u201clike\na sun that never sets,\u201d\u2122 they are referring to an old tradition about the planet Saturn. That\nWanadi was not the present Sun is additionally indicated by the fact that the Makiritare name\nfor the Sun is Shi.\u00ae\n\n\" Ibid.\n\n5 Sima Qian, Shiji-.\n\n61, E, Rose, \u201cVariations on a Theme of Philolaos,\u201d KRONOS V:1, pp. 12 ff.\n\n\u201877 Tbid., p. 26.\n\n18 Ibid. p. 27.\n\nDN, Talbott, op. cit., p. 41.\n\n\u00ae, p. 381.\n\n117, Nuttall, \u201cFundamental Principles of Old and New World Civilizations,\u201d Archaeological and Ethnological\n, p. 161.\n\n132 Mf, de Civrieux, Watunna:, p. 21.\n3 Ibid., p. 28.\n\n217",
