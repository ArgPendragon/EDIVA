Modem-day Moslems might not care to\nadmit it, but the most holy object in all of Islam, the Black Stone, which today is incorpo-\nrated into the Ka\u2019aba at Mecca, is also a meteorite.\n\nHere it is only fair to point out that Immanuel Velikovsky\u2019s claim that the Black Stone\nwas believed to have fallen from the planet Venus\u00ae cannot be substantiated. Even so, there\nseems to be no doubt that the Biack Stone \u201chad streaked out of the heavens one night in the\nforgotten past,\u201d and that it is nothing but a meteorite.\u201d\n\nThere has been some speculation that this meteorite had originally been reddish in hue\nand that its present black color is simply due to the patina of ages.* To my knowledge, this\nhas never been ascertained. In fact there is reason to believe that the Stone\u2019s blackness coin-\ncided with a special characteristic of mythic significance.\n\nThat the Ka\u2018aba was originally a shrine to the god and planet Satum has now been docu-\nmented.\u201d Also, the myths and astronomical lore of various nations connect the color black\nwith this very planet and its deity.\u00a9 As Hildegard Lewy pointed out, \u201cSaturn is frequently\ncalled the \u2018black\u2019 or \u2018dark\u2019 planet.\u201d It is this particular Saturnian curiosity that points to the\nBlack Stone\u2019s selection as a Saturnian symbol.

Having done so, he concluded that nothing of the sort could have tran-\nspired and that all those who were said to have witnessed the event had either been mistaken\nor lying.\u201d The reasoning was simple: As that indomitable arch-enemy of establishment sci-\nence, Charles Fort, put it, since there were no stones in the sky to start with, no stones could\nhave fallen from the sky.\u201d\n\nBecause of such episodes, many European museums ended up discarding genuine mete-\norites, which would have been of great benefit to the scientific world in later years, simply\nbecause they thought of them \u201cas shameful relics of a superstitious past.\u201d\u201d One meteorite\nfrom that era, however, was preserved \u201cdue to the protection given to it by the bishop of\nZagreb\u2019s consistory.\u201d This was the iron meteorite which had fallen at Hraschina in 1751.\nSworn statements by eye-witnesses were collected and, together with the iron fragment, were\nsent to the Austrian emperor. Eventually, both the documents and the meteorite came into the\npossession of the Vienna museum and the attention of the physicist E. F. F. Chladni who\ncommenced on a battle against the scientific establishment. In his paper of 1794, Chladni de-\nfended the trustworthiness of the Hraschina and other meteorites and was bold enough to\nclaim that these objects originated as cosmic debris which had penetrated Earth\u2019s atmosphere\nand fallen to the ground. Most of his colleagues, however, remained skeptical.\u201d\n\nBut then, in 1803, so many of the damned things fell and landed on the ground\u2014an entire\nshower of meteorites actually\u2014that the new investigator, Jean Baptiste Biot, had no option\nbut to accept their extraterrestrial origin.\u201d Even so, when, in 1807, two Yale scientists\nclaimed that meteorites had recently struck the ground at Weston, Connecticut, disbelief was\nstill rampant. Thus, when Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States, \u201cwho included\npalaeontology among his many interests,\u201d was told of the incident, he is reported to have re-\nplied that: \u201cIt is easier to believe that two Yankee professors would lie, than that stones\nwould fall from heaven.\u201d \u2122\n\nThere is a lesson to be learned here because, since the ancients, who had been reporting\nthe fall of such objects, swaddling them, worshipping them, etcetera, have been proven right\non this score, they should perhaps be given the benefit of the doubt concerning their reports\nof other astronomical occurrences which science has not yet had reason to accept as being\nvalid.",

It was not, however,\nmerely the priesthood which was obsessed with such lore but, as Juan de Torquemada re-\ncorded a century after the Spanish conquest of Mexico, even kings. Of Netzahualpilli, the\nking of Texcoco, he had this to report:\n\n\u201cThey say he was a great astrologer and prided himself much on his knowledge of the\nmotions of the celestial bodies; and being attached to this study, that he caused in-\nquiries to be made throughout the entire extent of his dominions, for all such persons\nas were at al} conversant with it, whom he brought to his court, and imparted to them\nwhatever he knew, and ascending by night on the terraced roof of his palace, he\nthence considered the stars, and disputed with them all on difficult questions con-\nnected with them.\u201d*\n\nIt is obvious from the pictorial elements included in various codices that pyramid-tem-\nples, as well as other structures, were utilized as astronomical observation posts. One of these\ncodices even shows a priest stationed in a temple doorway, peering through a cross-piece to\nobserve a celestial event. In fact, the symbol of an eye located within, or in conjunction with,\nsuch cross-pieces appear on other codices which treat of astronomical matters, thus indicat-\ning that this simple instrument was the one most frequently used in astronomical observa-\ntions.*\n\nGranted, most, although not all, of Mesoamerican astronomical knowledge is calendric in\nnature. It might therefore be countered that, since calendars are the outcome of solar and lu-\nnar motions, one should not be all that impressed with their knowledge. After all, as complex\nas they are, the motions of the Sun and the Moon are more observable than the fall of mete-\norites. The computation of such systems is not, however, all that easily determined. After all,\nthe calendar we presently use in the Western World was not computed until 1582.\n\nThe Mesoamericans\u2019 mathematical abilities, especially when it came to the calculation of\ntime-periods and, quite naturally, the formulation of calendars (of which they possessed more\nthan one), formed the dictatorial power that held sway over Maya life. The vigesimal system\nthey employed\u2014that is, a progression by twenties rather than by tens as in our decimal sys-\ntem\u2014enabled them to conduct complex calculations in their studies of astronomical phe-\nnomena. They understood, and utilized, the concept of zero a thousand years before Europe-\nans did. They learned how to accurately predict eclipses and were able to tabulate the mo-\ntions of the planet Venus with a precision that has stunned modern astronomers. The Dresden\nCodex, for example, gives a total of 11,960 days for 405 lunar cycles which, when compared\nto the modern value of 11,959.89 days, discloses an error of only one day every 380 years.*\n\nI will not here tax the reader\u2019s patience with a detailed scrutiny of Mesoamerican calen-\ndars with ali their complex calculations. Even so, a brief survey would not be amiss.\n\n% A. Aveni, \u201cAstronomy in Ancient Mesoamerica,\u201d, Jt Search of Ancient Astronomies (N.\nY., 1977), p. 174; see also, V. H.

In fact, a recognizable form of\nthis group appears on the face of Black God.\n\n\u201cThe Aztecs determined the occurrence of their most important feast day by the ap-\npearance of the Pleiades. According to Sahagiin, the ceremony of the Binding of the\nYears took place every fifty-two years and began when the Pleiades transited the ze-\nnith at midnight...\u201d*\n\nAs we have already noted, Saturn was known as the black god and/or black planet among\nvarious peoples of the ancient world. I therefore feel confident that the Navajo Black God\nmentioned by Aveni in the quote above will be found to have originally been a personifica-\ntion of the same planet. If this turns out to be correct, the association of the Pleiades with this\n\n5\u00b0 A Aveni, op. cit., p. 207.",

As Guy Anequin tells us:\n\n\u201cTheir measurements. ..were based entirely on sighting, calculations of triangulation\nand measurement of the movements of shadows. They observed that the stars, and in\nparticular the sun, were seen at different angles according to the time of the year.\nThey also noted that daily hours of sunlight varied from one day to another according\nto these positions \u2014they thus strove to locate the solstices, the extreme solar positions\nfor the longest and the shortest days of the year. For this, they probably used a gno-\nmon, a kind of sight made with only a vertical rod. The shadow on the ground at mid-\nday on June 21 was shortest, while at midday on December 21\n(the winter solstice) was the longest. The various sightings taken at sunrise from a\nfixed point will give a different angle throughout the year\u2014for in winter the sun rises\nfurther to the south and in summer further to the north on the eastern horizon...\n\n\u201cScrutiny of the night sky must have been no less important than that of day. Obser-\nvation of lunar transformations and trajectories were noted in the Dresden Codex,\n\n* Sec here, D.
