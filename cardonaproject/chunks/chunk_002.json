Even so, what are myths and legends?\n\nStrictly speaking, legends are traditional tales popularly regarded as historical myths. But\nthen what are myths? Myths are usually defined as primitive, or ancient, tales involving su-\npernatural beings, often embodying once-popular ideas concerning natural and historical\nphenomena.\n\nWhat, then, is the difference between myths and legends? There will be some who will\nclaim that there is no difference. Others may make a distinction between mythic tales told\n and mythic tales told about divine and semi-divine beings\n(mythology). Personally, I would make a further distinction in that mythology deals mostly\nwith cosmogonical origins. But let us not get caught up in semantics. Let me simply say that,\nin this work, 1 shall be concentrating on those tales dealing with divine and semi-divine\nbeings. One claim I shall, however, be making is that these tales are not mythic in the usually\nunderstood sense of the word. In other words, what I shall be claiming is that the tales I shall\nbe treating of are not to be considered untrue. On the contrary, 1 hope to show beyond a reas-\nonable doubt that these tales truly reflect events that, bizarre though they might seem, actu-\nally transpired in ages past.\n\nFranz Xavier Kugler, one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on Babylonian and Biblical\nastronomy, chronology, and mythology, who died in 1929, warned that:\n\nT= first criticism that will be leveled at this work is that it is based on nothing but\n\n\u201c\\ ancient traditions, even when they are dressed as myth and saga, cannot be\ndismissed lightly as fantastic, or worse, meaningless fabrications. It is particularly\nproper to avoid this pitfall when dealing with serious reports, especially those of a\nreligious nature such as those that occur in large number in the Old Testament.\u201d'\n\nIn this work, the word \u201cmythology\u201d is used in its original Greek meaning\u2014mytholo-\ngia, from muthos ot mythos, as pronounced by the Athenians, meaning \u201ctale,\u201d and logia, de-\nrived from /: that is, the telling of tales. There is nothing in the Greek term it-\nself which specifies that these tales were considered fictional. More than that, it were these\nvery tales that formed the basis of Greek and other religions of the ancient world. True, it\nshall be countered that these ancient religions were based on false premises. What I aim to\nindicate, on the other hand, is that these premises were anything but false.\n\n\u2018L.C.

As Gilbert Murray observed, according to the testimony of the Greeks\nthemselves, tragedy was explicitly concerned with the \u201csufferings of Dionysus.\u201d\u201d In fact,\nwhen dissatisfied with any particular play, the Athenians were wont to exclaim that \u201cit has\nnothing to do with Dionysus.\u201d *\n\n\u201cGreek tragedy, strictly speaking, was a peculiar form of art with narrow limits, both\nlocal and temporary. It was, in literal meaning, a \u2018goat-song,\u2019 i.e., a molpe (dance and\nsong combined), performed at the altar of Dionysus over the sacrifice of a dismem-\nbered goat, which, by a form of symbolism common in ancient religion, represented\nthe god himself.

It does not mean that Greek drama somehow\n\u2018evolved\u2019 from religious ritual, though this is commonly supposed.\u201d\u2122\n\nAs James also pointed out: \u201cThe ancient Greeks of the 5th century were much like\nus\u2014they liked a good drink, a laugh and good drama.\u201d\n\nOne can argue, as James has,\u201d against Murray\u2019s statements concerning the acting out of\nGreek drama as having taken place hardly \u201coutside one smail district of Greece\u201d or that\nGreek drama lasted as a living form \u201cnot much beyond the limits of the fifth century B.C.\u201d\nsince the available evidence, here, seems to contradict him. Thespis, for instance, was\nrenowned for his traveling shows which were usually performed on the back of a wagon.\nEven so, I cannot agree with James when he claims that Greek drama did not evolve from\nreligious ritual.\u201d Murray himself also stated that:\n\n\u201cWe must remember that the subject of Greek tragedy is always the heroic saga. It is\nnever an invented story, and it is never the history of ordinary human beings. I should\ndoubt if there was any named character in an Attic tragedy who was not actually in\nsome way an object of worship: a god or hero or at least the possessor of some taboo,\ntomb, or oracle, or ritual.\u201d\u2122\n\nAeschylus, the Greek poet and playwright, is renowned as the founder of Greek drama.\nHe is the first of the only three Attic tragedians of whose work entire plays survive. \u201cThe first\nthing that strikes a student of Aeschylus,\u201d according to Murray, \u201cis the strong Bacchic or\nDionysiac element ... \u201d* More than that: \u201cThe ancient critics seem always to recognize that,\nwhile Dionysus was, of course, the patron of all drama, there was something specifically\nDionysiac about Aeschylus.\u201d\u201d\u201d Nor is this merely Murray\u2019s contention. The Greek biogra-\npher, Plutarch, himself had had it stated that ai! of the plays written by Aeschylus were\n\u201cbrimming with Dionysus.\u201d\n\nHere, an incident in the life of Aeschylus may be pertinent. Apparently, the playwright\nhimself once acted a part in one of his own plays in which there was a reference to the god-\ndess Demeter. The audience, who suspected him of revealing the inviolable secrets of one of\nDemeter\u2019s rites, rose in anger against him. Aeschylus fled, seeking sanctuary, to the alter of\nDionysus which was erected in the orchestra and thus, at least temporarily, saved himself\n\nPp. J.

                "content": "with the crime before the Areopagus, in\nAthens, but his plea that he had not known\nthat what he had uttered was supposed to\nhave been a secret was accepted by the court\nwho acquitted him.\n\nMurray, of course, is not the only mod-\nem authority who holds, or held, the view\nthat Greek drama had its origin in Dionysian\nrituals. According to Karl Kerenyi \u201c[Fried-\nrich} Nietzsche [also] believed that in line\nwith an unassailable tradition, the oldest\nforms of Greek tragedy dealt exclusively\nwith the sufferings of Dionysus, and that for\na long time the sole hero of tragedy was\nDionysus.\u201d\u201d Like James, Kerenyi himself\ndid not quite agree, even going as far as la-\nbeling Nietzche\u2019s assertion as false. \u201cThe\noldest stage hero,\u201d as far as Kerenyi was\nconcemed, \u201cwas an enemy of Dionysus.\u201d\u201d\nBut I will not quibble here as to whether it\nwas Dionysus or his enemy who was con-\nsidered to have been the hero of early Greek\ntragic drama since this does not alter the fact that such tragedies were originally concerned\nwith the life and downfall of Dionysus himself. Thus, as Jane Harrison noted:\n\nGreek theatrical mask.\n\n\u201cThe plays were performed in the theatre of Dionysus, in the precinct of the god, his\nimage was present in the theatre, the chorus danced around his altar, his priest sat in\nthe front and central seat among the spectators. In the face of facts so plain it seems to\nme impossible that the drama had its roots elsewhere than in the worship of Diony-\nsus.\n\nLet us, however, temporarily set the opinions of modern scholars aside. What should\nreally concern us is what the ancient Greeks themselves had to say, because, after all, it was\nthey who were in the best position to illuminate us on the subject. In this respect, we have al-\nready noted what Plutarch had stated conceming the Dionysiac content of Aeschylus\u2019 plays.\nBut what of Greek drama in general?\n\nAccording to Herodotus, the Greek historian, \u201cthe tragic chorus\u201d that was part and parcel\nof Greek drama belonged \u201cto the worship of Dionysus.\u201d\u201d Aristotle went even further when\nhe wrote that tragedy \u201coriginated with the leaders of the dithyramb,\u201d\u00ae a wild choric hymn\nsung in honor of Dionysus by participants masquerading as satyrs, from which the festivals\nof Dionysus developed.
