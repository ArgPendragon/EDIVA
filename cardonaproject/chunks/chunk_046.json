                "content": "friend Quetzalcoatl. In the Popul Vuh, however, Hurakan and Feathered Serpent, there called\nGucumatz, are presented as partners in Creation. Thus, while we view Gucu-\nmatz/Quetzalcoatl as the embodiment of the Saturnian deity, it is obvious that Hurakan,\nwhile closely associated with proto-Saturn, was visualized as a separate entity.\n\nIn a recent work, M. Preuss had half a mind to identify Hurakan, which name she ren-\ndered by the Spanish spelling \u201cJurakan,\u201d with the constellation of Ursa Minor. This is in-\nteresting because Ursa Minor, the Little Bear, is the very northern constellation which con-\ntains the Pole Star, thus situating Hurakan in the very locality where the myths of other na-\ntions place the primeval north wind. Additionally, however, Preuss was astute enough to note\nthe connection between this deity and the axis mundi, the term used by mythologists to de-\nnote the boreal column said to have stretched between Earth and sky.\n\nOf additional importance is the fact that the name Hurakan translates as \u201cOne\nLeg\u20196\u2014 which brings us to the next motif in our unfolding scenario.",

This is indicated in the\npraises glorifying the god. As it was written: \u201cWho is this?\u201d And the answer is given: \u201cIt\nis Osiris.\u201d But, as an alternative, which, in this case, as in many others, boils down to the\nsame thing, the passage continues with: \u201cOthers, however, say that his name is Ra, and\nthat the god who dwelleth in Amentet is the phallus of Ra, wherewith he had union with\nhimself.\u201d85\n\nThe most popular ithyphallic god of Egypt was Min. Unfortunately, despite Ev Coch-\nrane\u2019s attempt to identify this deity as a personification of Saturn\u00ae and, later, through a\nchange of mind, as a personification of Mars,\u2019 not enough is known about this deity to reach\na definite conclusion concerning his genesis.\n\nAlthough at this point, as noted above, the inclusion of Shu would be out of chronologi-\ncal sequence, it is interesting to note that this god was inter alia lauded as \u201cLord of the Phal-\njus.\u201d88 In the Pyramid Texts, he is actually equated with the male organ of Atum.8? What is\neven more revealing, however, is the fact that, in some depictions, the heaven-sustaining Shu\nis replaced with the phallus of Geb. It is then evident that the phallus of the deity was itself\nbelieved to have acted as the support of heaven much in the same manner that the single leg\nof the god did.\n\nAs Diodorus reported, it was not only the Egyptians who consecrated \u201cthat member\u201d in\ntheir initiatory rites, but quite a few other nations. And, as a more modern authority noted:\n\n\u201cThe antiquity of the phallus as an amulet is shown by the number found among\nEgyptian sculptures. No visitor to Egyptian antiquities needs to be told this...The\nphallus was the most sacred amulet worn by the vestal virgins of ancient Rome.\nMoreover, we find that Sesostris of the early twelfth dynasty, who conquered Asia,\nset up memorials of a phallic nature among the people who had acted bravely...In the\nruins of Zimbabwe, in Central Africa, are to be seen phalli carved upon stone, similar\nto those found in Sardinia, which are said to be Phoenician...Again, numbers of\nphallic amulets in bronze are found in the earliest Etruscan tombs...\u201d\u00b0!\n\nMythologists have always assumed that phallic worship arose out of the ancients\u2019 recog-\nnition of the male member as a generative organ, and thus worthy of sacred honor as a sym-\nbol of fertility. Nor is this entirely a modern view, as evidenced by the writings of Dio-\ndorus.\u00ae? That this is a logical assumption there is no need to tell. As an example, the lower\npart of a statue of Dionysos, at Phigaleia, was covered with leaves of bay and ivy. Arthur\nCook surmised that this was \u201cpossibly\u201d done in order to conceal the god\u2019s erect phallus and\n\n84, p. 23.\n\n85, Van Over, op. cit., p. 283.\n\n86 E.

                "content": "Broken stone phalli, representative of the god himself, can still be seen at the sanctuary of\nDionysos, on the sacred island of Delos, to the mirth, embarrassment, and/or shock of visit-\ning tourists. But what is of greater importance to this study is that the same Dionysos, still\ndecked with ivy-sprays, was elsewhere represented by a post dressed up as the god.\u00ae That\nDionysos represented an aspect of the Saturnian deity need not be repeated.\n\nThe nature of what this divine phallus really was comes to us from Phlius. There, a\nwinged aged man with phallus erect was once depicted on the gates of the city. This being\nwas known as phaos rhyentes. What is interesting, however, is that, according to Hippolytus,\nphaos rhyentes was said by the Sethians to mean \u201cthe downward flow of light from above.\u201d%7\n\u201cFor there was a ray coming from above from that perfect light held fast in the dark, dread-\nful, bitter, filthy water...\u201d\u00b08 The \u201cperfect light\u201d from which this ray of light emerged was a\ndim remembrance of the Saturnian sun \u201cheld fast\u201d in the centre of its placental cloud, re-\nmembered here as \u201cdark, dreadful, bitter, filthy water\u2019\u2014-the \u201cmud,\u201d or \u201cslime,\u201d or mot of the\nPhoenicians. That this was a reminiscence of the ruach of Genesis is then indicated when\nHippolytus continues by stating that this was \u201cthe spirit of light \u2018rushing\u2019 over the water.\u201d\u201d\nAnd since this ray was remembered as \u201ccoming from above,\u201d it stands to reason that the\nwater in question was also somewhere above, presumably in the sky, as our thesis actually\ndemands.\n\nIt was then this \u201cdownward flow of light\u201d from proto-Satum and its placental cloud\nwhich the ancients likened to the god\u2019s single leg and/or his penis. In some instances, the god\nhimself was considered to have been nothing more than the phallus of Creation. Conse-\nquently, one of the meanings of the name of the Hindu Creator, Prajapati, is the male organ\nof generation. !0 More revealing is a passage in the Linga Purana which has been interpreted\nto mean that:\n\n\u201cPradhana, the primary unevolved matter, the cause of the universe is Linga itself. At\nthe root of Linga the creator Brahma is stationed.\u201d 1!\n\nHere not only do we again find a reference to our posited placental cloud as the \u201cun-\nevolved matter,\u201d but its direct association with the linga, that is phallus, as also with Brahma\nwho, as we have seen, originated as an avatar of Saturn. Curiously, in the Bhagavata Purana,\nthere is presented the image of a cosmic porpoise with the planet Saturn itself projected on its\ngenerative organ.!02\n\nOf most importance is the fact that, in some cases, a phallus \u201csculptured in granite,\nmarble, or ivory,\u201d which used to be kept \u201cin the inmost recess, or sanctuary\u201d of Hindu\ntemples, was \u201csurmounted by a golden star.\u201d 3 A similar colossal phallus was presented by\nPtolemy Philadelphus to the temple of Osiris in Alexandria. This, too, was crowned in gold\n\n95 Ibid., p. 228.\n\n9 A. B. Cook, foe. cit..\n\n97 W.

                "content": "Saturn. We may therefore safely assume that the pre-Islamic Samsu originally stood for the\nsame planet. This is lent evidence by the fact that our present Sun does not appear to be rest-\ning on any kind of pillar while, as we have seen above, the proto-Saturnian sun was so con-\nceived to have stood on a support which was in\u00e9er alia visualized as a vertical whirlwind, a\nsingle leg, and/or an erect phallus. Thus, Elmer Suhr, who confused so many mythological\nissues, was nevertheless astute enough to realize that the primeval wind \u201cis especially effec-\ntive in the heavens at the top of the cosmic column.\u201d10\n\nSuhr tells us that this cosmic column was \u201c\u2018a very old concept dating back to primitive\ntimes,\u201d and that it was the \u201csun\u201d on top of this column that created the wind \u201cby its whirling\nmotion.\u201d!07 Also: \u201cIt is especially important to think of the cosmic column not as a static post\nbut as a constantly whirling crucible, forever forming and re-forming the constituent ele-\nments into the changing aspects of human experience.\u201d 108\n\nThe memory concerning the association of this pillar with Satum was retained in the\nChristian Sybyllines which proclaim that Sabaoth Adonai \u201cshall sit on a heavenly throne and\nestablish a great pillar,\u201d!\u00a9? which is elsewhere rendered a \u201cpillar of glory.\u201d!!\u00b0 Sabaoth,\nsometimes rendered Zebaot, is a name derived from the Hebrew \u00a2saba or tseba\u2019ah, meaning\n\u201carmy,\u201d and is used in the New Testament as the military epithet of God.!!! Adonai, mean-\nwhile, means \u201cmy Adon,\u201d where Adon is a Phoenician title that simply means \u201cLord.\u201d !!2\nTaking their cue from the Canaanites, who were the same as the Phoenicians, the Jews used\nthe epithet Adonai to designate their own God. Thus it was said that when God asked Adam\nwhat his name was, Adam replied with the words: \u201cAdonai, Lord, because Thou art Lord\nover all creatures.\u201d 13 As Louis Ginzberg has it, the name Adonai is \u201cthe very name God had\ngiven unto Himself, the name by which the angels call Him, the name that will remain im-\nmutable evermore.\u201d'!4 Moreover, when Moses is said to have asked God for his name, God\nis reported to have replied:\n\n\u201cThou desirest to know My Name? My Name is according to My acts. When I judge\nMy creatures, I am called Elohim...when I rise up to do battle against the sinners, I\nam Lord Zebaot...when I have mercy upon the world, I am Adonai.\u201d ''5\n\nElsewhere it is said that Adonai and Elohim were \u201cthe two sacred names of God,\u201d !!6\neven though, in fact, he was known by various others. This, then, tells us that, as far as the\nJews were concerned, Adonai and Lord Zebaot, which translates as Sabaoth Adonai, was the\nsame as Elohim, the majestic plural of El, that is Saturn.\n\n106, p. 43.\n. 39.\n\n107 Tie\n108 Ihid., p. 79.\n109 W.
