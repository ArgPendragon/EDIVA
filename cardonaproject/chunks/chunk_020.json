Szebehely and R. McKenzie have even contested G. Hills\u2019 much earlier postulate of a\nstable Sun-Earth-Moon system,\u00b0 and have themselves reached the conclusion that the Moon\nmay someday escape from Earth to become itself a planet.? Thus, if the Moon can yet escape\nEarth\u2019s attraction to become an independent planet, what is so bizarre about another satellite,\nin this instance Earth itself, escaping the clutches of Saturn to become the autonomous planet\nit now is?\n\nThe Moon, however, is not the only celestial body in our system that has recently been\ncalculated to be capable of an orbital change. Computer simulations by Gerald Sussman have\nindicated that the orbits of the inner four planets\u2014Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars\u2014are un-\nstable and liable to future orbital changes. Doug Lin had also suggested as far back as 1982\n\u201cthat planets like Jupiter could migrate from the outer solar system in toward their parent\nstars.\u201d? While these are processes which are thought to take millions of years, the important\nthing to remember, for the time being, is that the new Science of Chaos shows beyond a reas-\nonable doubt that the Solar System is not the \u201cparagon of predictability that was once imag-\nined,\u201d!\u00a9 and that Laplace\u2019s deterministic world view no longer holds. What now turns up is\nthat resonance pervades the Solar System and that it probably acts through tidal effects. As\nfurther computer retrocalculations conducted by Archie Roy and his team have shown, the\norbits of the smaller bodies of the Solar System are actually chaotic and unpredictable. !!\n\nAnd then, in a study of planetary perturbations performed by John Bagby, it was found\nthat such computer simulations as the ones described above are not, of themselves, reliable\nbeyond a certain length of time. As he had it stated: \u201cI found that every outer planet all the\nway in to at least Mars, was so perturbed by some as yet unmodeled cause that their orbits\nneeded to be computerized every ten years.\u201d!*\n\nWhile Bagby\u2019s simulations had to do with the outer planets, as opposed to the orbits of\nthe inner ones simulated by Sussman, Roy, e\u00a2 ai, it should be noted that Mars was included in\nboth studies.\n\n4 Ibid., pp. 182-183.\n5 Those interested in this particular debate would do well to consult R.

Would this law not be violated had Earth once been a satellite of Saturn?\n\nBode\u2019s Law was actually discovered by Johann Daniel Titius of Wittenberg, Germany, in\n1772. But because it was brought to prominence by Johann Elert Bode, another German as-\ntronomer\u2014some say actually stolen by him!+\u2014it has become known by his name.\n\nWhat is this law?\n\nIn order of distances, the planets of the Solar System moving outward from the Sun are\nMercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. What Titius dis-\ncovered was that if we take the number 3, double it, then double the result, and keep on\ndoubling in that manner, we end up with the series 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, ete. Adding 4 to each\nof these numbers results in the series 7, 10, 16, 28, 52, 100, etc. If we then divide each of\n\nthese numbers by 10, we finally end up with 7, 1, 1-6, 2-8, 5-2, 10, and so on. What is ex-\ntraordinary about this final series is that it turns out to be in fair agreement with the actual\nmean distances of each planet from the Sun, still moving outward, when measured in astron-\nomical units. !5\n\nWhere this law was at first thought to fail was in its fourth placement, since there is no\n\nplanet to be found at 2-8 astronomical units from the Sun.

But, in 1960, Robert Bass demonstrated mathematically that\nplanets tend to space themselves in a Bode\u2019s Law type series of orbits, by what he termed the\nPrinciple of Least Mean Potential Energy,'6 even if initially disturbed. Thus the Bode for-\nmula\u2014for that is all it really is\u2014reveals absolutely nothing about the original spacing of the\nSolar System planets. This was validated in 1968 by the then Soviet theoretician A. M.\nMolchanov, who claimed that Bode\u2019s Law is actually the result of orbital resonances and that\nit could not be of primeval origin.!? This was again stressed seven years later by Michael\nOvenden, who renamed Bass\u2019 earlier axiom as the Principle of Least Interaction Action,\nwhen he reached a conclusion identical to Molchanov\u2019s\u2014\u201cthat the present distribution of the\nplanetary and satellite orbits is the result of mutual perturbations.\u201d!'8 What Ovenden deter-\n\n13 Idem, \u201cEvidence for a Tenth Planet or Massive Stellar Companion Beyond Uranus,\u201d presented at the\nTomorrow Starts Here Conference, sponsored by NASA, TRW, RCA, National Space Institute and Delta Vee,\nat Paio Alto, California, September 11, 1982.\n\n141.

Hills computed simulations of the N-body problem and discovered that\n\u201carbitrary planetary configurations, started with purely random initial positions and veloci-\nties, tend, during a few thousand to a few hundred thousand subsequent years, to \u2018relax\u2019 into\na Bode\u2019s-law type of resonant configuration.\u201d20 So much, then, for \u201cmillions of years.\u201d\n\nNow it is true that the planetary system that relaxed the fastest in Hills\u2019 simulations, at\nsomething like 2000 years, consisted of the Sun with four planets, each of which contained\nten times the mass of the Jovian planets\u2014hardly a portrait of our Solar System. However, the\nactual planetary composition of this simulation is not the central issue being discussed here.\nWhat is important to keep in mind is that Hills showed that, under certain conditions, planets\ncan relax into a Bode\u2019s Law type of configuration within a comparatively short time. And\nthis is important because, up to then, this had generally been thought to be\nimpossible\u2014which, if nothing else, proves that what is thought to be impossible in\nastronomy today may be thought of as being quite possible tomorrow.\n\nActually, as Bass informed his readers in 1974,2! the phenomenon discovered by Hills\nwas foreseen by Emest Brown as early as 1931 2? but no one seems to have paid him any\nheed.\n\nWhat all this implies is that Bode\u2019s Law is an empiricism based on the present spacing of\nthe planets. Lynn Rose explained it best:\n\n\u201cTt is usually not the case that mathematical gimmickry comes first, and that an inven-\ntory of the heavens is taken later. Usually the heavenly body count comes first, and\nthe tissue of mathematical rationalization is developed later. Thus Kepler first consid-\nered that there were six bodies orbiting the Sun\u2014Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,\nJupiter, and Saturn [since the rest had not yet been discovered]\u2014and then invented\nhis scheme involving the five regular solids to explain why there could be only those\nsix bodies. And in the eighteenth century, when Titius was working on his law and\nBode was stealing it, the properties of the known bodies were examined first, and\nthen the artificial mathematical formula\u2014now known as \u2018Bode\u2019s Law\u2019 \u2014was devel-\noped in an effort to rationalize what was already known.\u201d\n\nIn fact, one of the most reputable encyclopedias of astronomy has it stated that \u201cthe\nTitius-Bode Law...is most probably a mere coincidence.\u201d*4\n\nBe that as it may, when it comes to the actual Solar System, Hills\u2019 above-described\nmodel suggested to him that a reasonable estimate for the relaxation of the Jovian planets\ninto their present orbits would be between 100,000 and a million years. Thus, while it may be\npointed out that Bass himself was more concerned with the orbital crossings of an erratic\nVenus as proposed by Immanuel Velikovsky, which does not concern us here, than he was\nwith the Jovian giants, Hills\u2019 conclusion may be said to bode disaster for the Saturnian scen-\nario being proposed here. After all, a hundred thousand to a million years would hardly place\nour posited event within human memory.\n\n19.\nzt R. W. Bass, \u201cDid Worlds Collide?\u201d Pens\u00e9e 1, p. 11.\nIbid.\n22 BW.

This, also, is important because, according to point-particle Newtonian\nmechanics, the relaxation of planets into resonant orbits would be reversible. It was for this\nreason that, despite Ovenden\u2019s own disclaimer,25 Bass suggested the inclusion of tidal fric-\ntion as this would be one way of breaking this reversing tendency.\u201d Hills, as later Ovenden,\nsaw no reason to take this drag into consideration. Had they done so, their results would have\nbeen entirely different. As Bass indicated, the addition of tidal friction \u201ccould put the planets\non to vastly different orbits.\u201d?\u201d\n\nPersonally, I will not claim that tidal friction, or tidal friction alone, would resolve the\nSaturnian problem. In the meantime, however, it should be kept in mind that Bass was not re-\nlying on Hills\u2019 discovery as much as he was on an adaptation of it.\n\nEventually, Ovenden\u2019s Principle of Least Interaction Action failed in predicting the pres-\nent orbits of the Jovian planets. Ovenden could only save his Principle by postulating the\none-time existence of an additional massive object and then getting rid of it at some point in\ntime. According to this postulate\u2014which, at first glance, should seem wilder than the one\nbeing proposed in this work\u2014the Solar System has still not reached equilibrium\u201d? (which\nreminds us very much of Bagby\u2019s postulate concerning his undiscovered planet as the cause\nfor planetary perturbations). Ovenden placed the catastrophe which got rid of his one-time\nplanet at 16 years ago, while also stating that it would take something\nlike another 280 years for the Solar System to reach complete equilibrium\n{thus allowing his Principle of Least Interaction Action to fulfill itself). Since, however, [ am\nhere only concerned with the past and present orbits of the planets, Ovenden\u2019s 280 million\nyears of future orbital re-adjustments are irrelevant to our case. But we will take note that, ac-\ncording to Ovenden, the present near-equilibrium of the Solar System is not its final\nstage\u2014- that, in fact, the Solar System is still adjusting to a relatively recent planetary shuffle.\n\nNeedless to say, it will again be pointed ont that an event which supposedly occurred 16\nmillion years ago is hardly \u201crecent.\u201d But let us not get carried away just yet because one\nthing that Ovenden himself stressed takes the wind out of the above objection.\n\n\u201c...if it can be shown that processes operate within the solar system that can rearrange\nthe planetary orbits on @ sufficiently short time-scale then we must conclude that the\npresent distribution of planetary and satellite orbits contain mo information about\nconditions at the time of formation of the solar system.\u201d?9\n\nThis was expanded on later by Archie Roy when he wrote:\n\n\u201cWe have seen that the work of J. G. Hills and M. W. Ovenden demonstrated that af-\nter a short period of wild behaviour, a planetary system could settle down into a dis-\ntribution of orbits very similar to a commensurable Bode-type configuration.

And, on this issue, the historical record seems to be clear enough even if\nstill unrecognized by most conventionalists.",

The \u2018Mercury as Venus\u2019s Moon\u2019 theory explains at one\nstroke many observations, such as the reduced/reversed spin of Venus, its massive\natmosphere, the 2/3 spin resonance of Mercury, the oblate shape of Mercury, and\nmany more.\u201d\n\nGeorge Wetherhill posited an even wilder scenario for Mercury in which the planet had\noriginally orbited the Sun at Earth\u2019s present distance. Then, according to this particular the-\nory, Mercury was involved in a violent collision in which the planet was melted. A second\ncollision then resulted in the stripping away of Mercury\u2019s crust and its ejection out of its or-\nbit. Deflected from its path by Earth\u2019s gravity field, together with that of Venus, Mercury\neventually settled down into its present circular track.\n\nAlan Stern, on the other hand, came out with a proposition of satellite capture, rather than\nescape. Not that the capture of satellites by planets had not been propounded before. But this\none deals with the planet Neptune and its companion, Triton, a moon the size of the planet\nPluto. Triton, it was found out, orbits Neptune in what astronomers call \u201cthe wrong direc-\ntion,\u201d that is clockwise as seen from \u201cabove,\u201d when all other satellites revolve counterclock-\nwise. The most likely explanation for this, according to Stern, is that Triton had once orbited\nfreely but, passing too close to Neptune, was captured by the larger planet as its moon.\u00ae\n\nSo, similarly, with the planet Pluto which, until 1978, was still believed to be without a\nmoon, But a later ground-based photograph of Pluto revealed the presence of a\nsatellite\u2014since then named Charon\u2014 orbiting the planet. Because Charon is larger than our\nMoon, and one third as large as Pluto itself, Stern has said that it is \u201creally more accurate to\ncall this a double planet.\u201d5! Stern is thus of the opinion that these two planets had also once\norbited freely but that, coming too close, they managed to capture each other.*?\n\nBut what of Earth itself?
