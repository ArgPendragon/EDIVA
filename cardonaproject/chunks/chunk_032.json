As Talbott reported: \u201cI should mention here that, ac-\ncording to Wal Thornhill, it is possible that in the more electrically active phases the entire\nconfiguration may have moved within a [plasma] discharge sheath\u2014something that would\nnot preclude general illumination by the Sun, but could have kept the illumination diffuse.\u201d*\nIn his own work, that same year, Thornhill described the \u201c{Saturnian] planetary group\u201d as\nhaving been \u201cinside a gigantic cometary coma.\u201d Three years later, Thornhill restated his\nconviction when he wrote that, in his opinion, Earth orbited in the anode dark space beneath\nthe chromosphere of the brown dwarf that was proto-Saturn.\u201d\n\n\u201cEarth situated inside the spherical envelope of such a star radiating according to the\nusual inverse square law, would find the energy influx almost equal over the entire\nplanet. Such an arrangement is far more benign toward life than at present where the\nenergy source, the Sun, subtends a small angle in the sky.\u201d\n\nBrown dwarf stars, to which we had compared both Saturn and Jupiter in an earlier\nchapter, had by then been discovered in quantity. In our neighborhood alone, it has been\nstated, there may be more brown dwarfs than Sun-like stars.\u201d Some of these have been cal-\nculated to be one-tenth the size of the Sun with a temperature rising no more than 950\u00b0 K.\n\nIn answer to the question whether living entities, including man, would have been able to\nbreathe the constituents of Saturn\u2019s brown dwarf atmosphere, Thornhili replied with the\nwords:\n\n\u201cWe are [presently] nestled in the Sun\u2019s atmosphere without it causing us any prob-\nlems. Proto-Saturn\u2019s envelope would have been more dense but still a good approxi-\nmate to a vacuum. The constituents of the atmosphere of brown dwarf stars, so far as\nthey have been determined, seem to include water molecules and others helpful to\nlife\u201d?\n\nWhat did Thornhill mean by stating that we are presently nestled within the Sun\u2019s atmos-\nphere. As Gary Zank plainly puts it: \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded by hot gas.\u201d And whence this gas?\nZank explains:\n\n\u201cAs our sun moves through extremely \u2018empty\u2019 or low-density interstellar space, the\nsolar wind produces a protective bubble\u2014the heliosphere around our solar system,\nwhich allows life to flourish on Earth...Without the heliosphere, neutral hydrogen\nwould interact with our atmosphere, possibly producing catastrophic climate changes,\n\n37, p. 61.\n\nIbid.\n\n%, p. 95.\n\n\u00a9 Idem, \u201cStars in an Electric Universe,\u201d AEON V:5, p. 48.\n\n\u00a9 Ibid.\n\n\u00ae A.

The spectrum of the light would\nhave been much redder than at present...\u201d\n\nTrue, as already noted, Earth\u2019s primordial star would have been feebler than our present\nSun, but this would have been compensated for by Earth\u2019s proximity to proto-Saturn which\nwould have involved a stretch that was much shorter than its present distance from the Sun,\nto say nothing of the redder spectrum of light in which it would have been bathed.\n\nBut could Saturn\u2019s plasmasphere have existed within the Sun\u2019s heliosphere which is itself\nnothing but a plasmasphere?

Instead, this medium was found to consist of plasma.\nBut, even then, the full implication of this discovery was not immediately understood. As\nRalph Juergens, writing in 1972, noted:\n\n\u201cOne of the primary characteristics of a plasma has up to now received little or no at-\ntention from astronomers. This is its ability to shield itself from the electric field of\nany body in contact with it, or contained within it, and charged to an electric potential\ndifferent from that of the plasma itself. The mechanism by which such shielding is\naccomplished was named the space-charge sheath by those who first studied the phe-\n\nnomenon.\u201d\u201d\n\nAnd:\n\n\u201cBy the same sort of analysis, | would conclude that the earth has a potential not quite\nin keeping with its space environment, and that it therefore is surrounded by a space\ncharge sheath. For the same reasons that a comet\u2019s sheath is elongated away from the\nsun, | would suppose that the earth\u2019s sheath has a tail; in other words, I would equate\nthe terrestrial sheath with the earth\u2019s so-called magnetosphere.\u201d\u201d\n\nSo, also, Wallace Thornhill who, during one of the question periods at the Society for\nInterdisciplinary Studies\u2019 Silver Jubilee in September 1999, made reference to \u201cEarth\u2019s\nwindsock-like envelope\u201d usually referred to as its \u201cmagnetotail.\u201d As he there pointed out: \u201cIn\nJuergens\u2019 view it is a plasma sheath...\u201d\u201d\n\nBy the turn of the century, astrophysicists themselves were speaking of plasmaspheres\naround the bodies of the Solar System as if they had always known about them. Venus, it was\ndiscovered, possessed a plasmasphere in the form of a cometary tail that spread close enough\nto \u201ctickle the Earth when the two planets are in line with the Sun.\u201d\u00ae Jupiter, too, is now\nknown to be surrounded by a plasma sheet which, like the Sun\u2019s electrical current sheet, lies\nalong Jupiter\u2019s magnetic equator.\u201d So, similarly, with Saturn. As Thornhill noted, had Sat-\num\u2019s plasma sheath been visible in the sky, it would make the planet appear as a distinct dise\ninstead of the mere pin-point of light we see in the night sky.\u201d Eventually, Earth\u2019s own\nplasmasphere, which has been calculated to extend at least 12,000 miles into space, was even\n\u201cphotographed.\u201d\u201d\n\n7 R, Juergens, \u201cReconciling Celestial Mechanics and Velikovskian Catastrophism,\u201d Pens\u00e9,\np7.\n\n\u201d Thid., p. 12.\n\n\u00ae W.

On the contrary, the theory\nnot only fits current astrophysical reality, it is actually demanded by it.\n\nAll of the plasmaspheres within the Solar System, however, are transparent and, as such,\nare not able to reflect radiation back toward the primary around which they are wrapped.

This was an age which,\ndespite its remoteness in time, ended up etching itself indelibly in human consciousness. It\nwas a time during which the Sun, the Moon, and the stars were not yet visible in the sky. Sat-\nurn ruled alone.\n\nHypothesis #7: This age, we have also found out, could not have been one of total dark-\nness, and that, in fact, mankind itself remembers that the Saturnian deity actually shed a\nfeeble light. The terrestrial environment during this age was bathed in a perpetual twilight or,\nrather, a protracted dawn, which man remembered as the dawn of Creation.\n\nHypothesis #8: That, during this period, a nebulous entity, which our ancestors had diffi-\nculty in describing clearly, surrounded the Saturnian primary. We have conjectured this en-\ntity to have been a placental cloud, or circumstellar disk, surrounding the Saturnian orb. This\nentity seems to have been that to which the ancients alluded to as Chaos.\n\nHypothesis #9: During this same unspecified period, the Saturnian orb was seen to float\nover an apparition which, to ancient man, looked like water, a cosmic ocean. This \u201cwater\u201d\nwas probably the same nebular disk which, spinning slowly, would have had the appearance\nof a celestial whirlpool.\n\nHypothesis #10: That, at some later time, Satum shone much brighter than it had previ-\nously done, bright enough for ancient man to allude to it consistently as a sun.\n\nHypothesis #11: That this primordial Saturnian sun shone during that time we today call\nthe night.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that ancient man could only describe what he had witnessed\nin the sky. Our ancient forefathers could not, however, tell what the cause of any of it was. It\nis even doubtful that they thought about it or even cared. To them, whatever it was they saw\nwas simply there. Unlike our present Sun, proto-Saturn did not rise or set. It did not move. It\njust sat there, doing nothing. It offered them no harm. It had always been there. They had al-\nways remembered it. They would have taken it for granted.\n\nThere is, however, one discordant note concerning all this.

This, then, presents us with yet another opportunity to test the internal\nconsistency of the mytho-historical record because, if the above surmise is correct, our theory\ndemands that the record should have something to say about the subject. If man could not teil\ntime, he would have known nothing about it. The idea of a day, a month, or a year would\nhave meant nothing to him. The concept of time would not even have occurred to him.

As William Heidel had earlier noted:\n\n\u201cTt is not for naught that Pherecydes identified Cronus [the same as Kronos] with\n, whose cycle is defined by the year...The myths and festivals of\nCronus-Saturn prove beyond a doubt that he was associated with the turn of the\nyear...for the myth of the Golden Age, which coincided with the beginnings of man-\nkind...is connected with the reign of Cronus-Saturn...In keeping with this fact is the\nrecognized association of Saturn with Janus.\u201d\u201d\n\nThis view has more recently been echoed by Livio Stecchini:\n\n\u201cTt is true that for a person who consults a dictionary the name Kronos is different\nfrom the Greek term chronos, meaning \u2018time\u2019; but there is no difference to a person\n\n*R.
