But here,\nagain, the theory demands that the record itself should so identify these deities.\n\n has for many years been presented by mytholo-\ngists as the representation of the Sun, we found that this celestial entity was not by the\nAssyro-Babylonians themselves identified as such, but, rather, as the planet Saturn. In the\ncase of Helios, we have seen that the ancient Greeks themselves had originally used this\nname to designate the planet Saturn, and that only later was the name imposed upon the Sun.\nIn the case of the Egyptian Ra, the so-called sun-god par excellence, we presented an ostraca\nwhich directly identified this luminary as Kronos, which was the name the Greeks bestowed\non the planet Saturn. But because this datum is both late and solitary, the theory then de-\nmands that the characteristics of Ra should not coincide with those of the Sun. And, as we in\nfact saw in the very first Chapter of this work, the characteristics of Ra as described in an-\ncient texts fit anything but those of the Sun. So, also, with the Indic Surya, as was pointed out\nin Chapter 3, and a host of other so-called sun-gods.\n\nOur assumption that Earth had once been a satellite of Saturn raises its own demands in\nthat the mytho-historical record should at least contain some data to indicate that Saturn had\nbeen close enough to be seen as a distinct and large sphere suspended in the sky. And, to be\nsure, besides the fact that most of the so-called sun-gods are actually depicted in the form of\na disc, we also found it specifically stated that Janus/Saturn, to say nothing of Ataksak, was\nactually described as a sphere. Additional evidence was also presented from Africa where, to\nthis day, natives of that continent are not only able to point to the present pin-point of light\nthat is the planet Saturn, but insist that the planet is surrounded both by a ring and by a bevy\nof nine moons, Barring intervention from extra-terrestrials\u2014which we have already had rea-\nson to discount\u2014the only way in which these natives could have come upon this knowledge\nis through the assertion of their ancient ancestors who would have viewed the planet at close\nquarters.\n\nIn presenting our evidence that Saturn was fixed permanently in one spot, we relied\nsolely on the record itself. But here a disconcerting item reared its ugly head in that various\nancient texts describe the Egyptian Ra as rising and setting. The record therefore demands\nthat this apparent contradiction be resolved. In studying the original texts in which these\nstatements are contained, we came to the realization that the risings and settings of Ra are\ndue to mistranslation. The mythological texts in question say nothing about a rising or setting\nRa. What they do describe is the \u201ccoming forth\u201d and \u201cgoing in\u201d of Ra. That mythologists,\nbelieving Ra to have been the Sun, understood these terms as \u201crising\u201d and \u201csetting\u201d is, of\ncourse, understandable. But, in view of Ra\u2019s lack of solar characteristics, and in view of Ra\u2019s\nidentification as an immobile luminary, the terms in question are here understood to refer to\nthe shining and dimming of the Saturnian sun, a cycle which will be explored in a future vol-\nume.\n\nIn its turn, this immobility demands an explanation.

More than that, with Saturn having been\npositioned in Earth\u2019s north celestial sphere, terrestrial tides should have accumulated at\nEarth\u2019s north polar region. The hydrosphere, moreover, would not have been the only terres-\ntrial element to respond to Saturn\u2019s attractive force. The atmosphere should also have piled\nup at Earth\u2019s northern areas.

True,\nKing-Hele was here appealing to glacial rebound, but it must be kept in mind that the melting\nand re-solidifying of glacial ice occurred simultaneously in both the north and south poles.\nGlacial rebound should therefore also have been simultaneous. So why would this isostatic\nrebound create a lithospheric bulge only in the north?

As Hall indicated:\n\n\"The small dimensions of this shift indicate the pull was short term (as in centuries to\nmillennia) rather than eons. Furthermore the effect is relaxing, and in geological\nterms the distorting influence must have been remarkably recent.\u201d**\n\nLeroy Ellenberger, an avowed antagonist of the Saturn thesis, found fault with this theo-\nretical base.

                "content": "duced a bulge which today would be measured in kilometers!\u201d\n\nBut, if I may ask, how does Ellenberger know this? How does he know how far Saturn\nwas from Earth in order to deduce the height of Earth\u2019s tidal bulge under its influence? How\ndoes he know how long this tidal bulge would have existed? And how does he know when\nthe Saturnian configuration disrupted? I, for one, had never as much as hinted at these pa-\nrameters and, without knowing any of these quantities, nothing can be said concerning the\nheight of the original bulge or to what extent it should have relaxed by now. (Besides, as El-\nlenberger himself knows, and as others have pointed out,\u201d it was not just the positioning of\nSaturn above Earth\u2019s northern pole that was responsible for raising the world\u2019s lithospheric\nbulge. There were additional forces which came into play, but it would be premature at this\npoint to go into all that.)\n\nAnd then, is it just the northern bulge per se that we should be concerned with? What\nabout the fact that Earth\u2019s crust is generally thicker in the northern hemisphere than it is in\nthe southern? Sure enough, this has been explained as arising from the additional fact that\n\u201cmost dry land exists north of the equator,\u201d\u201d but it has never been asked why this should be\nthe case.\n\nExponents of the continental drift theory look at the configuration of Earth\u2019s land masses\nand conclude that the continents must have once been joined together. I look at the same con-\nfiguration and see something else. I do not, by this, deny continental drift and plate tectonics.\nBut consider:\n\nTwo of the biggest continents on Earth, and India also, taper toward the south pole. None\ntaper toward the north. The highest percentage of Earth\u2019s land masses, as noted above, occurs\nnorth of the equator; the highest percentage of the Earth\u2019s oceans, south of the equator. In the\nextreme north, the continents come together at the \u201ctop\u201d of the world to form a circle which\nis filled with the Arctic Ocean. As if to counterbalance this, in the extreme south we see that\nit is the oceans which come together at the \u201cbottom\u201d of the world to form a circle which is\nfilled with the Antarctic continent. Earth\u2019s axis passes from the centre of the Arctic Ocean to\nthe centre of Antarctica. Is this merely fortuitous? Is it merely by chance that Earth\u2019s land\nmasses are mainly congregated in the north? (As to whether or not the Arctic Ocean existed\nduring the era of Saturn\u2019s proximity, I shali leave to a future work.)\n\nThere is another problem to consider. Encircling the Arctic Ocean is a blanket of detritus\nknown as muck. This area is so vast it actually covers one seventh of Earth\u2019s land surface.\nThis muck is composed of deep-frozen \u201cgoo with silt, sand, pebbles, and boulders, often with\nmasses of preserved, semi-decayed, or fully decayed vegetable and animal matter.\"\u201d This\nfrozen mess lies on low level plains.

                "content": "come as a surprise to some readers neither is the Moon\u2019s gravitational pull powerful\nenough to raise oceanic tides.\u201d And yet it does.\n\nAnother objection raised by Urey is that it \u201cis difficult to believe that the interior of the\nMoon can support such stresses for geological periods of time.\u201d*' That may be so, but the\nbulge is there, so that no matter what forces came into play to raise it, the \u201cinterior of the\nMoon\u201d does presently support it. There is no point in saying that this is impossible.\n\nMoreover, as Keith Runcorn admitted, under present conditions, the lunar bulge \u201cwould\nhave disappeared long ago.\u201d For that reason, some authorities have been claiming that the\nlunar bulge is not raised by tidal forces, but by some other unknown mechanism. However,\nwhile this is not the place to go into this particular subject, the height of the lunar bulge\nwould conform rather well if it was formed relatively recently, even more recently than the\nterrestrial one, under conditions other than those presently postulated.\n\nOne other thing to keep in mind here is that, given what we know, or think we know,\nabout tidal forces, Earth is bound to tidally affect the lunar surface, and that this effect is\nbound to manifest itself on the lunar hemisphere facing Earth. So that if the lunar bulge in\nquestion is not the result of Earth\u2019s tidal attraction, where, then, is the manifestation of that\nforce?\n\nNow, as it happens, Ellenberger has had reason to raise further objections to our hypothe-\nsis concerning Earth\u2019s lithospheric bulge. As he had it stated:\n\n\u201c...were the miniscule northern bulge manifested in the geoid truly of tidal origin as\nclaimed, then the geoid would not be pear-shaped, but would instead be a prolate el-\nlipsoid, with the bulges at north and south. This follows from the elementary fact that\ntidal bulges express themselves on both the near and far side of the subject body, as\nwith the lunar tide which occurs twice a day...\u201d*\n\nRoy Gallant succinctly explained the phenomenon in the following words:\n\n\u201cGravitation, remember, weakens as distance becomes greater. So the Moon tugs with\ngreater force on that side of Earth facing the Moon, with less force on matter at\nEarth\u2019s center, and with the least force on Earth\u2019s far side. A second tidal bulge thus\nforms on the far side where a hill of water is \u2018left behind\u2019. Since this water is farthest\naway from the Moon, it is tugged with the least force.\u201d\u2122\n\nThe fact that lunar tides affect Earth\u2019s oceanic waters twice a day is due to Earth\u2019s rota-\ntion as it catches up with the secondary tidal bulge.

                "content": "stance, entirely true that oceanic tides occur twice daily. There are many areas which are af-\nfected by only one tide per lunar day.*\n\nEven so, why did not Earth develop a secondary bulge at its south pole?\n\nActually, who can say it did not? To begin with, the hydrosphere is one thing, the litho-\nsphere is something else. Water, being a liquid, responds much easier to tidal forces than\ndoes the solid lithosphere. And then, with the pull from the stationary Saturn being weakest\nat Earth\u2019s south pole, a secondary buige at that location would have been much lower than\nthe northern one. Who is to say that a southern bulge did not form under Saturn\u2019s constant\npull and that this bulge, being much lower than its northern counterpart, has since completely\nsettled down?\n\nOf course, we can never know whether such a southern bulge ever formed. But then, is it\nadamant that such a southern bulge should have formed? There is no secondary bulge on the\nMoon counteracting the one facing Earth. But because this lunar bulge has been disqualified\nas a tidal one, we look for a better example. I therefore point to Phobos, one of the Moons of\nMars, an irregular chunk of rock measuring a mere seventeen miles across its longest axis. It,\ntoo, exerts a gravitational pull on Mars and, yes, it, too, raises a slight bulge on that planet.\u201d\nBecause Phobos orbits the planet faster than Mars is able to rotate, this Martian bulge tends\nto lag behind\u2014but there it is, and there is no opposing secondary bulge to counteract it.\n\nBut then how much do we really know about tidal forces? We know so little about them\nthat we cannot even predict the tide for any point on an ocean.* Oh yes, we can forecast the\ntides for all principal ports and other shore lines, but \u201cthese are not computed from general\ntheory...but from analysis of tidal records over a long period of years at the particular port\nconcerned.\u201d\u201d\n\nThere is also no point in appealing to Isaac Newton\u2019s laws because the Newtonian\nscheme fails to explain these vagaries.\u201d As James Gilluly and his associates pointed out:\n\u201cThese and many other facts make it clear that the tides are not a simple direct response to\nthe vertical component of the moon\u2019s gravitational pull, which is really far too small for ef-\nfective lifting of the water masses anyway.\u201d Granted that these words were written in 1951,\nin the interim nothing much has changed in that respect\n\nSo what, then, is the bottom line? From the little we know about tidal forces, the Sat-\nurnian model we have been investigating stil/ demands that a lithospheric bulge would have\nbeen raised at Earth\u2019s north pole, and that this bulge would have subsided somewhat once\nEarth\u2019s linear alignment with Saturn was broken. The remnant of such a northern lithospheric\nbulge exists to this day. We can therefore safely claim that this demand is met.\n\n55 J, Gilluly, et al., ap. cit., p. 396.\n\n5 Ihid., p. 398.\n\n*\u2019 Anonymous, \u201cFear of Phobos,\u201d, p. 13.\n* J.
