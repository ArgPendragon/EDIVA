Only among the more sophisticated Incas, long out of primitiveness, was\nThunder, for instance, considered something of a deity, and even then he was subservient to\nthe Creator.\u201d And there, I must stress, lies the difference, because, according to his own\nStatements, ancient man was not concerned with the purported antics of fog, fair weather, or\nother nature spirits, demons, and fairies. What concerns us in this study are the great deities\nof mankind\u2014the creators and destroyers, the movers of the world\u2014which we find imbuing\nthe religions and cosmic beliefs of early civilizations and primitive tribes alike.\n\nAgain, 1 am not attempting to negate the fact that so-called primitive cultures perceive the\nworld as being spirit animated. But what of it? Until a few hundred years ago, were not the\nmost sophisticated centers of European civilization also imbued with superstition, which is\nwhat a spirit-animated belief amounts to? Are countries like China and India, Indonesia, and\nheaven knows where else, not superstition-ridden to this day? Do they not still throw live\nchickens into volcanic craters in Java,\u201d and pour gin, in lieu of awa, to Pele in America\u2019s\nfiftieth state, as endeavors meant to pacify the destructive force exhibited by volcanoes?\u201d\nDoes any of this negate the fact that the countries in question also pay homage to a higher\ndeity dictated by whatever religion these societies adhere to? Why, then, could not primitive\nplanetary worship have co-existed with a more down-to-earth animism?\n\nAs research implies, residual planetary worship continues to saturate the most primitive\nbeliefs up to the present, as exemplified by the religion of the Efe pygmies mentioned above.\nNor must this particular example be viewed as unique. Space does not here permit anything\nclose to a fair sampling of such cases but I could easily have included a catalogue of similar\nresidues found embedded in the beliefs of such people as the Dogon of the Sudan, which is\npresent-day Mali, the astronomical lore of whom we have already discussed in a previous\nchapter; the Negroes of Mozambique; the Bambala of the Congo; the Bushongo; and many\nother tribes from the African heartland. The mythology of Oceania is likewise saturated with\ntesidual planetary worship as is that of the Inuit from Alaska to Greenland. None of these\nprimitive societies, and others like them, can be said to be astronomically adept, yet, when\ntraced to their basic fundamentals, the roots of their religious beliefs exhibit an uncanny simi-\nlarity to the planetary motifs found scattered among the more sophisticated early civilizations\nof man. True, demons and nature spirits also abound, but none of these play a cosmogonic\nrole or hold a prominent place in the complex religious rituals performed by these societies.\n\nStudents of religion will tell us that logic dictates that man would have first endowed\nwhat he could see around him with spiritual life before he would have done likewise with the\nfar away planets, But, in that case, should he not have looked upon the Sun and the Moon as\n\n\u00a9 H.

How is it then that, while not always\nreadily obvious from cursory studies, the prime protagonists were invariably the planets and\nplanet-induced phenomena?\n\nThis poses something of a conundrum to those who view mythology through uniformitar-\nian eyes, one that has already been commented on by Immanuel Velikovsky\u2122 and David\nTalbott.\u201d The riddle, however, is solved when we discover, as in fact the sources themselves\nconvincingly illustrate, that the planets, or at least some of them, prime among them the\nplanet Saturn, were once more conspicuous than Sun and Moon.\n\nOnce this is accepted, as it is by an ever-growing body of neo-catastrophists, it becomes\nmuch easier to accept that before man had developed an awareness of the heavenly bodies,\nhe had no gods at all.\n\nThis would seem to lead to the assumption that early man lived for long ages before he\ndiscovered his first god but the fruits of research indicate otherwise. In the first place, one\nmust stop thinking of the planets in this instance as mere pin-points of light in the night sky.\nIt should by now have become obvious to the readers of this work that man\u2019s earliest mem-\nory of the planets is one that hints at recognizable orbs hanging low in the sky.\n\nAs we have thus far seen, originally there seems to have been only one such orb visible in\nthe sky\u2014the planet Saturn. Mankind, it now seems, discovered its identity under the close\ninfluence of this planetary body which is why the Saturnian deity, in his many guises, is to be\nfound at the head of every major pantheon throughout the ancient civilized world.\n\nThis primeval Saturn entered man\u2019s memory first as a passive entity which was originally\nlooked upon with neither fear nor awe. But, as I intend to show in a future work, this was not\nto remain so. In time, a series of events transpired which so impressed the human mind that\nSaturn became, for man, the very centre of his environment, his ever-increasing awe and,\neventually, the deduced reason for his very being. Given all this, while not wishing to borrow\n man\u2019s original deity was a plane-\n prime among these deified bodies was the planet Saturn?\n\nThe question, of course, is simply this: Is there any proof that any of this transpired? So\nlet me be quite honest. If proof is what we are after, it is not forthcoming\u2014any more than\nproof to the contrary is. But the evidence now at hand, which we shall continue to present, is\nmore than enough to upset antiquated views of man\u2019s emergence as a religious being and\nquite capable of upholding this new, if revolutionary, theory.",

The\nKing James version of the passage in question is made to read:\n\n\u201cHave ye offered...sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of\nIsrael? But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the\nstar of your god, which ye made to yourselves,\u201d !3\n\nThis memory was still vivid in the days of the New Testament and is repeated in the Acts\nof the Apostles where the figure of Chiun is replaced with that of Remphan:\n\n\u201c...O ye house of Israel, have ye offered...slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of\nforty years in the wilderness? Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star\nof your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them...\u201d 4\n\nThis is in keeping with the Septuagint version of the same passage which reads:\n\n\u201cHave ye offered...victims and sacrifices, O house of Israel, forty years in the wilder-\nness?

To\nus, whether Chiun was worshipped by the Israelites during the time of Moses or the days of\nAmos does not change the fact that the Israelites did worship this god. Nor does it change the\nfact that this deity was no other than the Saturn of other nations.\n\nThere will now be those who will want to tell me that it is no secret that the Israelites of-\nten fell prone to worshipping false idols and that the case in question reflects no more than\nthat. And, in truth, this is the way in which the verse has been understood by adherents of\nboth the Gentile and Hebrew versions. The association of Shabtai/Satum with the Hebrew\nSabbath, however, as well as the additional data we will be presenting in the following pages,\nincluding, incidentally, the very name of Israel, speaks against this.\n\nMoreover, hidden within the expression of the Masoretic version of Amos is a datum that\nwill actually strengthen our case. Here I can safely state that even were sikut (that is\n\u201ctents/tabernacles\u201d), it would in\nno way invalidate our thesis. Not only would the Saturnian connection of this verse remain\nthrough the undisputed inclusion of Chiun/Kewan, but, ironically, the Assyrian god Sakkuth\nis himself associated in Akkadian texts with the planet Saturn.?2\n\nNow it so happens that, just as Shabtai/Satum translates as \u201cthe resting Planet,\u201d so is\nChiun/Saturn related to a similar characteristic. The word chun, from which the name is de-\nrived,33 carries the meanings of \u201cestablish,\u201d \u201cfix and/or fixed,\u201d \u201cfirm,\u201d and \u201cstable.\u201d34 Very\nmuch like Shabtai, Chiun can therefore be translated as \u201cthe fixed, firm, or stable planet Sat-\nurn.\u201d In other words, the reference is to a planet at rest. What could this mean?",

One cannot, therefore, rightly blame mythologists for identifying\nHammu as a sun-god since, in effect, he was the personification of just that\u2014a sun; the pri-\nmeval Saturnian sun to be sure, but a sun nonetheless.\n\nThe association with justice, however, is not the only datum on which we can base the\nidentification of Hammu as a personification of the planet Saturn?
