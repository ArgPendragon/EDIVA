It is a complete history...of the nature of an in-\ntense plasma occurrence in the Solar System as it once was at a time when mankind was pre-\nsent to record it...God Star delineates mythology from fable, setting the former as a true field\nof scientific enquiry. From God Star springs forth topic after topic on the physical conditions\nand processes our planet has undergone...”\nAnthony L. Peratt, B.S.E.E., M.S.E.E., Ph.D\n(Former Scientific Advisor, United States Department of Energy)\nFlare Star\n(2007)\n“Flare Star is essential reading for anyone interested in geology, archaeology, paleontology,\nand/or the recent history of the Solar System. Cardona correlates information from astrono-\nmers, geologists, plasma scientists, and from comparative mythologists to demonstrate that\nthey use different methods but come to many similar conclusions. He notes several known\nproblems in science that are not often stressed outside the scientific community and then pro-\nvides possible explanations to said problems with one basic assumption concerning the origi-\nnal plasma environment around Earth...Although Cardona’s God Star was first in the se-\nries...a reader would not be lost starting with Flare Star. They compliment each other and\nboth are very important books.”\nC. J. Ransom, Ph.D\n(Plasma Physicist, University of Texas at Austin)\nPrimordial Star\n(2008)\n“Cardona’s work explains so many of the mysteries and anomalies of planetary science and\nhistory in a coherent and logical model. It seems that plasma and electromagnetism probably\nhold the key to our past as well as our future, and that the history of this planet is nothing like\nthat portrayed by conventional wisdom. I can’t recommend this book strongly enough.”\nDavid Drew\n(Book reviewer —London— England)\nCopyright—2011—by Dwardu Cardona.\nCopyright —2011—by Dwardu Cardona.\nCover illustration by Richard M.
