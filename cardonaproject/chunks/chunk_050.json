I will in no way be embarrassed if I\nhave to retract whatever is found not to fit the general hypothesis presented herein. That is\nthe way theories are supposed to be formed. That is the only way science can progress. I\nknow this work will run its gamut of criticism. I am prepared for that. After all, if what I have\npresented bears any semblance to what really transpired in the past, the tenets of various sci-\nentific disciplines will have to be reconsidered. Such revisionist work will not sit well with\nthe old guard. But, to use another old clich\u00e9, do not mistake me for a lonely voice in the de-\nsert. I am not alone in most of what I have so far presented. 1 belong to an ever-growing\nschool of interdisciplinarians who have immersed themselves in the above and related stud-\nies. The old guard will eventually pass away, as it always does. It is to younger minds that\nthe future is bequeathed. In the meantime, | put a gun to no one\u2019s head, so believe what you\nwill.\n\nThe main problem with the reconstruction of these hoary events lies with plasma cosmol-\nogy which, ironically, serves as the best evidence in favor of their occurrence. As in other\nmatters touched upon in this work, once again, this is not to be wondered at. Despite Hannes\nAlfv\u00e9n\u2019s pioneering work in the 1930s, and Anthony Peratt\u2019s more recent seminal disclo-\nsures!, plasma cosmology is still in its infancy. As the latter confessed in 1992:\n\n|: is not reasonable to expect a work of this scope to be entirely free of error. But, relying\n\n\u201cBecause of their strong interaction with electromagnetism, plasmas display a com-\nplexity in structure and motion that far exceeds that found in matter in the gaseous,\nliquid, or solid states. For this reason, plasmas, especially their electrodynamic prop-\nerties, are far from understood.\u201d2\n\nGranted that plasma science has progressed immensely since then, its exact behavior in\nrelation to astronomy remains temporarily controversial. Worse still, proponents of the proto-\nSaturnian model are not all of one mind when it comes to the mechanics involved in keeping\nthe configuration stacked up in linear formation. And this entails the exact nature of proto-\nSaturn\u2019s polar column. The main contestant of the specific nature of this column as adduced\nin the foregoing pages stems from the fertile mind of Wallace Thornhill whose knowledge of\nplasma physics ranks him among the best in the field. It behooves us, therefore, to take his\nobjections seriously enough to comment at some length about them.\n\nThus, for instance, not only does Thornhill not believe in brown dwarf jets, he even\ndoubts the ejection of brown dwarfs from stars. True, as we have seen, he had previously\nstated that in his humble opinion, HH 34 is spitting out objects \u201cwhich might become\u201d indi-\nvidual brown dwarfs.3 A day later, however, he revised his opinion by claiming that such a\n\n!.\n\n2 Ibid., p. 2.\n\n3 W.

Nor would it have been possible for it to\nhave provided Earth with light, feeble or otherwise, let alone enough heat to generate and\nharbor life.\n\nWhat, then, can be said against this? Speaking of the plasma experiments he conducted,\nAlfv\u00e9n asked: \u201cIf we can extrapolate from the laboratory to the solar system, which is a hun-\ndred trillion times larger in extent, then why shouldn\u2019t plasma still behave the same way for\nthe entire observable universe\u2014another hundred trillion times larger?\u201d T point this out here\nbecause, if it is allowable to scale up from laboratory experiments to the Solar System, and\nfrom the Solar System to the Universe, it must then be allowable, as it really is, to scale down\nfrom stellar masses to brown dwarf stars and even lower to sub-brown dwarfs. As Don Scott\npointed out:\n\n\u201c are\ncompletely unimportant. They all work the same way.\u201d7\n\nScaling down, however, involves more than just size and mass. It also involves ampli-\ntude, and thus luminosity, as well as distance and even speed, to say nothing of time. All\nelements must be scaled down, and not necessarily all by the same percentage. Thus, when\nthe knots in an astral jet are scaled down to sub-brown dwarf proportions, they will no longer\nbe as bright as stars, but, at best, only as bright as the sub-brown dwarf that spawns them.\nAnd even then, this only hoids true for the knot\u2019s initial inception. If the sub-brown dwarf\nthat was proto-Saturn eventually turned into the gaseous planet we now know by that name,\nwhat is there against assuming that its knots would eventually turn into rocky terrestrial plan-\nets? The light-years distance which separates jet condensations from their stellar parents\nwould also then be scaled down to more modest stretches. Besides, does not Thornhill accept\nthat proto-Saturn had been a brown dwarf star? Does he not himself interpret proto-Saturn\u2019s\npolar column as a sustained plasma discharge in the form of Birkeland current? And has he\nnot also told us that astral jets are a more active and visible manifestation of the same\nBirkeland current?\n\nAt the risk of befuddling the reader, this is the manner in which Thornhill extricated him-\nself from the above dilemma:\n\n\u201cInstead of being a small but normal stellar anode in the galactic discharge, and ac-\ncepting electrons, proto-Saturn would find itself a cathode, ejecting electrons, once it\nentered the Sun\u2019s more positively charged domain. Proto-Saturn was then no longer a\nstar by definition. It was a comet!

The knots, or condensations, in comctary tails also travel down the tail, and quick suc-\ncession of photographs indicate that they move at speeds up to 250 kilometers per second\n(540,000 miles an hour). Their motion, however, is erratic, with the acccleration \u201cturning on\nand off capriciously,\u201d as it varies with time.

Beginning with the sug-\ngestion of W. Baade and R. Minkowski in 1954, astrophysicists have assumed that astral jets\nconstitute the actual ejections of matter.27 But, as Don Scott more recently noted:\n\n\u201cWe should not infer too much when we see the word \u2018jet\u2019 used (especially by as-\ntronomers). A columnar plasma can /ook like a jet. But these jets are not jet engine\nexhausts\u2014they are not massive flows of material. There may not be much stuff\nflowing in the jet\u2014except for an electric current. The \u2018stuff\u2019 may be getting squeezed\nwhile remaining relatively stationary within the \u2018jet\u2019.\u201d\u00b08\n\nOr, to quote Peratt, who himself uses the word \u201cjet\u201d in relation to these astral emanations\nthroughout his 1992 opus:\n\n\u201cGood as \u2018jets\u2019 are, [they] are not really jets. They are perceived as \u2018jets\u2019 of gas by\nastronomers and jets of gas do exist. But gas jets do not have the radiation properties,\nnot even the features, of what we observe in space.\n\n\u201c except when a very strong\nmagnetic field is there to keep it from immediately flaring out...The term \u2018jet\u2019 is very\npopular and convenient if physically incorrect.\u201d29\n\nWhich brings us back to Andrew Gray\u2019s \u201celectric discharge\u201d hanging out in space with-\nout dissipating, to say nothing of Thornhill\u2019s own sustained plasma discharge.\n\nAnother objection that Thornhill raised is that \u201cbeing enveloped in a plasma vortex would\nnot be conducive to pleasant living conditions\u201d3\u00b0 since this would have placed the entire\nEarth within the vortex of a world-wide tornado.3! And, to be sure, while astra] jets are rela-\ntively slim or narrow in close proximity to the stars that spawn them, they tend to fan out\nfarther away, \u201creaching a diameter wider than the orbit of Pluto.\u201d32 But this, again, is merely\na matter of scale. Thus when we look at HH 34 we see quite distinctly that the width of the\njet is not as wide as the diameters of the knots embedded within it. This is even more evident\nin HH 409, the jet emitted by HD 163296. These two systems show quite clearly that the\nwidths of astral jets fall short of the diameters of the knots. In fact it is quite obvious that,\nwere these knots to be thought of as planets, the jets would only encompass their polar areas,\nvery much as posited for proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column in relation to Earth.\n\nThornhill is also of the opinion that had Earth really been suspended within an astral jet\nemanating from proto-Satum, all of terrestrial life would have been electrocuted. In view of\nthe number of deaths of people reported to have been struck by that plasma discharge known\nto us as lightning, Thornhill\u2019s concern is understandable. This author was himself, at the age\nof twelve, blown off his feet by a lightning discharge. Fortunately it was not a direct hit.

But, as\nDon Scott felt moved to clarify, this would only have ensued at ground zero and could never\nhave applied to Barth\u2019s entire population.*+\n\nThornhill disagreed, stating that, as the voltage rises, \u201cthe plasma would extend to lower\nlatitudes until the entire surface of the planet was covered.\u201d>5 He did not, however, provide\nan electrical justification concerning why the jet\u2019s voltage should rise. And then, again, we\nrun headlong into Thornhill\u2019s belief that proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column was a sustained plasma\ndischarge in the form of Birkeland current. Why, then, would this sustained plasma discharge\nnot be subject to a similar, if not identical, rise in voltage?\n\nOne of Thornhill\u2019s greatest objections has to do with the force that would have kept Earth\naligned with proto-Saturn\u2019s rotational axis, which brings us full circle to the problem we\nstarted with. As he had it stated: \u201cNo one has shown how massive planets can be simply sus-\npended above the pole of a star while enveloped in a plasma discharge.\u201d** And:\n\n\u201cMost of the planets so far discovered {in extra-solar systems] are gas giants that oc-\ncupy normal [that is equatorial] orbits close to their stellar parents. They are not sus-\npended in polar stellar jets.\u201d37\n\n\u201cIf [what Cardona claims was} the normal mode of planet formation we should not\nexpect to find planets around nearby stars by looking for the stellar wobble caused by\nnormal orbits.\u201d 38\n\nBut, for one thing, no one is advocating that planets can only be formed through poleward\nejection. If Arp is correct in that some galaxies are ejected from other galaxies in a lateral di-\nrection, the same may probably be true for the ejection of some stars and planets. And then,\nalso, no one is proclaiming that planets ejected in poleward direction must remain forever\nstacked. Obviously, the Saturnian system itself eventually relaxed into equatorial orbits once\nit entered the domain of the Sun. Meanwhile, because of their very lack of equatorial orbital\nmotion, any extra-solar planets suspended in polar jets would not cause stellar wobble, and\nwould thus be among the most difficult celestial objects capable of being detected.\n\nThornhill claims that \u201cthere would need to be a persistent force to keep the planets sus-\npended above a stellar pole.\u201d3\u00b0 In discussing the E galaxies aligned along the jet of M87,\nArp, too, found reason to ask an identical question: \u201cWhy had not these older galaxies drifted\noff this alignment into the general field in all this time?\u201d But as he himself recognized, \u201cbe-\ning ejected along the minor axis [that is the axis of rotation] they have no angular momentum\nand simply remain along their original ejection direction.\u201d\u201d This applies just as well to our\nhypothesized situation because, out in space, there would have been no nearby bodies that\nwould have tended to exert their attractive influence on proto-Saturn and its entou-\nrage\u2014which is one additional reason demanding that the proto-Saturnian system would\noriginally have been a free-floating sub-brown dwarf system outside our Solar System.\n\n34D, Scott, on ibid., January 9, 2002.\n\n35 W.

Neither is he adverse to the claim that proto-\nSaturn itself ejected planets which are now members of our Solar System, together with our\nown Earth, precisely as postulated in the present thesis. Exactly in what, then, does he dif-\nfer from us? One of the main reasons behind Thornhill\u2019s list of objections enumerated above\nbecomes apparent when he compares proto-Saturn\u2019s characteristics to Jupiter's magneto-\nsphere. As he explained:\n\n\u201cThe polar column can then be imagined as having been equivalent to a hyperactive\nmagnetospheric display of a size exceeding that of Jupiter\u2019s in which the Birkeland\ncurrents were visible. Remember that Jupiter\u2019s \u2018tail\u2019 stretches invisibly for half a bil-\nlion km to the orbit of Satum.\u201d#\n\nJupiter\u2019s \u201cmagnetospheric display,\u201d which stretches into its billion km \u201ctail,\u201d is however\nequatorially wrapped around the giant planet. It is not a polar, or bipolar, emission. And this\nis precisely Thornhill\u2019s point because, as far as he is concerned, the planets were ejected\nfrom proto-Saturn in a lateral, or equatorial, direction. As we have seen, according to Thorn-\nhill, only on entry into the Solar System would the planets have aligned themselves in a lin-\near configuration as proto-Saturn dragged its entourage behind it much in the manner of\nComet Shoemaker-Levy 9. Thus, still according to him, \u201cwe are talking simply about a linear\narrangement of bodies where the only force between them is attractive.\u201d*+ This would then\nconform with Talbott\u2019s contention that Earth had originally orbited proto-Saturn in a phase-\nlocked equatorial orbit, concerning which no evidence was ever produced from the mytho-\nhistorical record, and against which enough objections have already been raised in the past\npages of this work.\n\nWithin the confines of Thornhill\u2019s scenario, it then becomes evident that proto-Saturn\u2019s\npolar column would also have come into being after proto-Satum and its entourage invaded\nthe Solar System. And it is this scenario that precludes him from accepting the pre-existence\nof proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column.*5 But, as Peratt stated on the strength of his plasma studies,\n\u201cthe column is the configuration out of which planets form so it should always have been\nthere.\u201d4\u00a9 Thus, when I brought it to Peratt\u2019s attention that, according to the mytho-historical\nrecord, proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column was one of two items\u2014the other being the celestial wa-\nters\u2014which was never seen as having been created, he reaffirmed both our positions by as-\nserting that there is much quantitative evidence that tends to support this.47\n\nGranted that we have been discussing emissions of vastly different amplitudes, might we\nnot, after ali, be embroiling ourselves in nomenclature? One thing we have surely learned is\nthat the demarcation between stars, red dwarf stars, brown dwarf stars, sub-brown dwarf\nstars, and giant gascous planets is simply one of magnitude. We have also been discussing\nknots, condensations, plasmoids, and planetisimals \u201cimbedded\u201d in astral \u201cjets\u201d when, in fact,\nthese are terms that connote the same phenomena even if, perhaps, at different stages of\n\n42 W.

On the contrary, as he has made clear to me:\n\n\u201c,..the biggest difficulty 1 see with matching the Saturnist interpretation of the his-\ntorical records is the very long time scales needed for dynamical and material evolu-\ntion.

While\nnot entirely convinced during the conference, he soon showed interest right after the event\nthrough personal communications with David Talbott and Wallace Thornhill. Thus, during\nthe proceedings of the KRONIA conference, held in Laughlin, Nevada, in July of the fol-\nlowing year, he had no qualms in stating that, because of scaled-up Birkeland currents, he\nwas not surprised to hear of the Saturnian configuration or its attendant polar column.\u201d As\nThornhill later reported:\n\n\u201cAccording to Peratt, the recognized authority on the subject, the plasma behaviour\nfits the detailed representations of the polar column perfectly. I am aware of the com-\nplexities of plasma discharge instabilities and am satisfied with Peratt\u2019s subsequent\nidentification of the polar column with that phenomenon. The \u2018Peratt instabilities,\u2019 as\nthey are now known, turn out to be far more complex than any of us could have\nimagined and therefore form an unbeatable test of the polar configuration model.\u201d\n\nWhat led Peratt to seriously consider the Saturnian, or polar, configuration theory was his\nown first-hand experience with plasma experiments at the Los Alamos National Laboratories,\nNew Mexico. To begin with, having served as Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s secretariat, he was quite familiar\nwith the latter\u2019s theories. Thus, during a lecture given at one of Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s \u201cNew Astronomy\u201d\nseminars at the University of California, San Diego\u2014circa 1980-1981 \u2014 Alfv\u00e9n had proposed\nthat cosmic objects form in columns,>! very much in the manner being here propounded. As\nPeratt later clarified, plasmoids are produced in an electrical discharge.>? And:\n\n\u201cPlasma cosmogony, via Alfv\u00e9n, provides the physics for the evolution of the plas-\nmoids into planetisimals and eventually planets. These form like beads on a string.\u201d 3\n\nIt might be argued that one planet suspended beneath another, or beneath a sub-brown\ndwarf, can hardly be compared to \u201cbeads on a string.\u201d However, as those who are already\nfamiliar with the Saturnian configuration theory know, and as will be disclosed in future se-\nquels to this work, there were other planets besides Earth that were involved in the configu-\nration in question. Even so, when questioned on the possibility of brown dwarf stars ejecting\njets, Peratt\u2019s answer echoed Thorhill\u2019s with a resounding \u201cno.\u201d*4 How, then, can this be\ncompatible with his assertion that cosmic bodies form in columns like beads on a string?\n\nTo begin with, plasma experiments have convinced Peratt that planets and their satellites\ncan form entirely independent of any star.55 If nothing else, this would eliminate the neces-\nsity of searching for proto-Saturn\u2019s parent, a search that, even if one existed, would certainly\nprove futile in any case. But the question that this raises is: How, then, would strings of plan-\nets form?\n\nThe answer to this takes us back into Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s domain, concerning whom Peratt had this\nto say:\n\n49 Verbally stated.\n\n\u00a9 W.
