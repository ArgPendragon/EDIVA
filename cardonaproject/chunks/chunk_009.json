                "content": "come cheap. It is one thing to hypothesize, but quite another to uphold the hypothesis\u2014at\nleast Lemaitre had general relativity on which to rely. In this respect, David Leveson was\nshrewd enough to note: \u201cIn scientific as opposed to pseudo-scientific polemic, evidence has\npriority over hypothesis,\u201d adding that \u201chypothesis must conform to evidence, not evidence to\nhypothesis.\u201d And he goes on with: \u201cIf evidence contrary to a given hypothesis is found, the\n be altered or rejected.\u201d But then he was astute enough to warn\nthat: \u201cThis does not mean that when contrary evidence is found the hypothesis is immediately\nrejected; it may be retained tentatively in the hope that further evidence may eventually\nexplain the \u2018contrary\u2019 evidence in terms of the theory.\u201d\"* As he also pointed out:\n\n\u201cIndeed, many hypotheses are arrived at intuitively, through a \u2018flash of insight,\u2019 and\nmay be maintained in the mind of the investigator in spite of much initial \u2018contrary\u2019\nevidence, and later be vindicated ... But a legitimate researcher will not consciously\nsuppress contrary evidence. Certainly he will not publish a hypothesis until he has\nsatisfied himself that all the available evidence is in accord with it. Indeed, if he is\nproperly conscientious, he will search for contrary evidence to test the validity of his\nideas. Hypothesis may precede evidence in time but not in importance.\u201d\u201d\u201d\n\nThese are guidelines that will be kept in mind as we attempt to unravel the lost history of\nour Solar System in the pages that follow. But, even so, the question must be asked: What\nconstitutes evidence? As Daniel Trifiletti noted:\n\n\u201cThe very nature of evidence changes from one discipline of science to another. What\nis evidentiary to one person is excluded by another. Facts are not the same for every-\none. Since we cannot all agree as to what constitute \u2018facts,\u2019 deductive arguments\nalone can never be fully convincing...\n\n\u201cThere is another approach, however, for assessing what might be considered\n\u2018dubious\u2019 by some. That recourse is inductive reasoning. Let it be recognized that no\nfact stands alone, but is part of a whole constellation of other facts. At some point,\nwhen enough facts have been collected, each individual point of light may be seen as\npart of a newly recognizable figure\u2014an organic whole. Eventually the sheer weight\nof even \u2018dubious\u2019 facts becomes too large to ignore.\u201d",

Truer words have rarely been spoken.\nBut this fossilized memory betokens a knowledge, a remembrance, of what once took place\nin heaven and, in that respect, it can safely be stated that myth constitutes the history of the\nSolar System.\n\nHere I can best illustrate the above by repeating a story that was well known to the an-\ncient Greeks. The story involves the god Helios\u2014-usually identified as the personification of\nthe Sun*\u2019\u2014who was believed to drive his flaming chariot across the sky. When, once, He-\nlios told his son Phaethon that he could ask him for any boon, Phaethon replied by asking to\nbe allowed to drive his father\u2019s chariot. At first Helios, repenting of his oath, tried to dissuade\nPhaethon by stressing the dangers involved in driving the chariot. But, when Phaethon in-\nsisted, Helios, having given his word, was left with no recourse but to give in to his son.\nPhaethon, still in the pride of his youth, leaped into the chariot, took reins in hand, and began\non his journey. The steeds drawing the chariot, however, felt that the weight they were carry-\ning was too light and they leaped into the air as if the car was empty. This occasioned them to\nleave their usual well-beaten path, and Phaethon, who lacked his father\u2019s expertise, panicked,\nand, in trying to correct his erroneous course across the sky, pulled this way and that way at\nthe reins, confusing the horses further. Losing control of the chariot, Phaethon ended up\ndriving it too close to Earth with the result that Earth\u2019s moisture was dried up by the heat of\nthe chariot and, in due course, Earth caught fire and came close to being annihilated by the\nconflagration. In the end, Zeus himself was forced to intervene, Sending forth one of his ter-\nrible thunderbolts, he smote Phaethon with its might, shattering the chariot and freeing the\nhorses. The fragments of the wrecked car were scattered and Phaethon himself, with flames\n\n21 [bid., pp. 429-430.\n\u2122 But see further in this work,\n\n71",

It was on the way from the airport that Peiser first in-\nformed us of the above revelation. He also told us, however, that while astronomers had\ncome around to seriously consider terrestrial catastrophism as having possibly been caused\nby asteroidal and cometary impacts, they were still adamant in their denial concerning the\npossibility of planetary catastrophism within the historical, and man\u2019s prehistoric, past. Not\nonly that, Peiser, who seems to have no use for planetary catastrophism himself, also warned\nus that the persistence of belief in planetary \u201cbilliards\u201d can only prove a hindrance to the\neventual acceptance of cosmic catastrophism. Peiser sees this face-about by astronomers and\ntheir allies as a positive step forward.

                "content": "their book, The Cosmic Serpent, is concerned, it can safely be stated that they relied quite\nheavily on Immanuel Velikovsky\u2019s Worlds in Collision. Of course, Velikovsky dealt in plan-\netary catastrophism, whereas Clube and Napier re-interpreted Velikovsky\u2019s mytho-historical\nsources in light of cometary bombardments. They could not, of course, escape the fact that\nthe sources themselves stress the role of planets in lieu of comets. They got around this by\nthe supposition that planets were named as the perpetrators in lieu of comets because the\ncomets had first appeared close to the planets and thus received planetary names.\n\nEven so, the sudden interest in cosmic catastrophism among establishment science was\nnot influenced by the work of Clube, Napier, Velikovsky, or any of their predecessors in the\nfield, but was largely due to the insights derived from three separate events\u2014one ancient, the\nother two recent. The ancient event concerns the demise of the dinosaurs at the end of the\n due to the terrestrial impact\nof a celestial body, which was first proposed by de Laubenfels in 1956,\u2122 twenty four years\nbefore the team headed by Luis Alvarez stole the credit for the hypothesis. At first described\nas \u201ca nutty theory of pseudoscientists posing as paleontologists,\u201d\u2122 the proposal has now\ngained general acceptance. Even so, because this event is supposed to have transpired mil-\nlions of years ago, it did not do much toward the gaining of respectability by cosmic catas-\ntrophism. In that respect, neither did the terrestrial impact of a heavenly bolide in the Tun-\nguska region of Siberia, which occurred on the morning of June 30, 1908, exploding in a\nblinding flash and flattening twenty-five square miles of the surrounding forest, since this,\ntoo, was considered an isolated case. Although the warning should have been clear, the event\ndid not attract much attention in the Western World until the late decades of the century. It\nwas, more than anything else, the most recent of these events, when Comet Shoemaker-Levy\n9, which had broken up into a train of twenty-one separate fragments, smashed into Jupiter\nduring the month of July in 1994. Had there been a slight deviation in the comet\u2019s orbit, all\ntwenty one pieces could have plowed into Earth. But even with this terrestrial miss, it be-\ncame painfully apparent that if a comet can smash into a nearby member of the Solar System,\nanother one could just as easily collide with Earth.\n\nAll of a sudden there was a flurry of activity among astronomers centered on the detec-\ntion, and possible elimination, of Earth-crossing objects, while geologists have gone wild in\ntheir attempt to discover previously unrecognized impact scars in our terrestrial terrain. His-\ntorians began pouring over historical, pseudo-historical, and mytho-historical documents in\nthe hope of discovering records of possible past impacts, while archaeologists started re-\nsifting the dust of ages to see what they might have missed among the scattered ruins of past\ncivilizations that might be interpreted as cometary, or asteroidal, destruction. So that, in a\nmanner of speaking, the writing of this book does not exactly place me in bad company\u2014but\nonly in a manner of speaking.\n\nComets plowing into Earth remain a far cry from planets shifting on their orbits\u2014that is\nif these shifts are maintained to have transpired during the advent of man on Earth. As\npointed out above, it was because of the supposed impossibility of such orbital shifts that the\nastronomers Clube and Napier thought it expedient to re-interpret the mytho-historical record\nin a cometary light, claiming that planets were named in the ancient records simply because\ncomets had appeared in close proximity to the planets and thus were given planetary names.\nAnd, to be fair, this is not exactly a spurious idea.

Third, although it might be redundant to say so, it was the comets that were given\nplanetary names, and not the planets that were given cometary ones. And this is a lesson that\nClube, Napier, and all those who wish to recast the planetary deities as cometary ones have\nfailed to learn.\n\n\u00a9, p. 85.\n\n211, Fuhr, \u201cOn Comets, Comet-Like Luminous Apparitions and Meteors,\u201d KRONOS VIII:1, p. 43.\n\u2122 See here, for instance, the comet named Eileithyia, mentioned by both Hephaistion and Pliny, as noted in\nIbid., pp. 42, 46.\n\n76",

Such an objection would,\nhowever, be based on ignorance since the various civilizations whose mytho-historical re-\ncords we wil! soon be examining were actually quite knowledgeable when it came to obser-\nvational astronomy. A detailed exploration of this ancient astronomical lore would constitute\na book of its own. Thus, despite the length of this chapter, what is presented below consti-\ntutes only a brief account of the major astronomical discoveries made by our ancient forefa-\nthers.\n\nI will start with a topic that might be considered mundane\u2014meteors and meteorites.\nThese had been falling from the sky since time immemorial. Our primitive forebears would\nnot have been strangers to such falls. And, unlike the deification of planets, the sanctification\nof meteorites is more understandable. Meteors do not appear merely as pin-points of light in\nthe night sky. Even when they do, as shooting stars they leave a short-lived luminous streak\nin their wake. Every so often, veritable showers of these streaky flares seem to radiate from a\nlocal spot in the sky. When conditions permit, such showers can be quite impressive. More\nrarely, meteors roar in the shape of terrible fire balls through the sky, night or day. Their ex-\nplosive impact on the ground can be quite a frightening experience. Such events, when wit-\nnessed, must have awed our primitive ancestors. The occurrences would have been remem-\nbered with fear and even reverence.\n\nDepending on conditions, an impacting meteor may or may not form a crater. The meteor\nitself may be burned and atomized in its passage through Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Often enough,\nstony chunks or masses of iron remain on the ground as evidence of the bombardment. The\narrival, or apparent materialization, of such objects in places where fire balls were seen to\nstrike must have mystified primitive man to no little extent. Such objects, when found, would\nhave been thought to be magical, possessing benign or evil powers, if not both. It is under-\nstandable that such objects, now known as meteorites, would have been collected, preserved,\nand even revered. But we find that there was more than that. Lincoln La Paz put it succinctly\nwhen he wrote:\n\nr | Nhere will be some who might object that ancient civilizations had enough knowledge\n\n\u201cThe ancients supposed the stars to be the domicile of gods; falling stars and falling\nmeteorites signified to them either the actual descent of a god or the sending of his\nimage to earth.\u201d'\n\nThe worship of meteorites\u2019 as images of the gods, however, could only have accrued\nfrom a prior belief that the gods resided in the sky in the form of stars. Thus, if stars were\n\n? L. La Paz, Topics in Meteorites: Their Recovery, Use, and Abuse From Paleolithic to Present (Albuquerque,\n1969), p. 86.\n\n7",

                "content": "meteorites were associated with specific deities and, in some cases, with specific planets.\n\nOne thing to note here is that it can thus be seen that the ancients were well aware of the\nphenomenon. The Babylonians referred to meteors as Kakkabu rabu.\u2019 This recognition, how-\never, did not keep the ancient peoples of the Near East from attributing sanctity to meteorites.\nNor did it keep them from identifying them as images or pre-existing deities.\u201c\n\nAmong the Semites, especially the ancient inhabitants of the Arabian peninsula, stones\nwere frequently credited with divine attributes.* These cults, as Hildegard Lewy indicated,\u00b0\nwere practiced by the same people who worshipped the visible planets. Philo Byblius tells us\nthat the Phoenicians considered meteorites as \u201cstars fallen from the air,\u201d and that these\nplayed a dominant role in the religion of his ancient forebears.\u2019 These meteorites, as Lewy\nstressed, \u201cwere conceived as divine beings of exactly the same nature as the planets.\u201d*\n\nA meteorite which fell at Tyre, in Syria, was associated with the goddess Astarte.\u201d What\nis of additional interest here is that, according to those very Phoenicians who venerated her,\nAstarte was the same as the Greek Aphrodite\u2019 and, therefore, like her, the goddess of the\nplanet Venus.\n\nAccording to a passage in the New Testament, one of the sacred images that was wor-\nshipped at Ephesus, and associated with Artemis/Diana, was believed to have fallen from the\nplanet Jupiter.\" \u201cfocused their worship\non a meteorite at the shrine of Emesa.\u201d\"? A large, conical, black stone, this \u201cimage\u201d was later\ntransported by the emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, who assumed the name of his god, to\nthe temple of Kybele in Rome. Another famous meteorite which was held as sacred in this\nregion was the Magna Mater at Pessinus, in Asia Minor.\u2019* Worthy of mention was also the\nstone which fell at Abydos and was worshipped there. \u00b0\n\nAccording to the Egyptian priest Manetho, as quoted by Plutarch, the Egyptians consid-\nered lodestones to be the bones of the god Horus, while iron, in general, was believed to be\n.'* Meteorites were venerated not only\nin honor of Set but also in honor of the great god Amon\u201d whom the Greeks, rightly or\nwrongly, identified with their own Zeus,\" and the Romans, quite naturally, with Jupiter.\n\nThe ancients were so well acquainted with meteorites that, before its discovery as an ore\nin the bowels of the Earth, they were of the belief that ai/ iron fell from the sky.
