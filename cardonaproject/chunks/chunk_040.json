My main\ninterest, here, concerns the much earlier Tertiary period. In this respect it is noteworthy to\nnote that when, in the 1980s, remains of sub-tropical flora and fauna were discovered by So-\nviet scientists in Spitsbergen, the axial tilt hypothesis was revived and, as of this writing,\n understanding of what had to have\ntranspired in ages past.'4\n\n\u201cIn the early 1980s, scientists proved the far North had once been a tropical paradise.\nThe tilt of the earth shifted and so did the weather.\u201d!'5\n\nMost scientists on the American continent, however, were not convinced.

To conform with thermodynamics, and an Earth\ntilted 23 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic [as at present], these environments had to\nbe considerably closer to the equator. If they were closer to the equator, then either\ncontinental drift occurred both much more rapidiy and mysteriously than the geologi-\ncal record indicates, or else the Earth has tilted or experienced crustal slippage in\nsome fashion that aliowed warming of these lands without disrupting the continuity of\nequatorial rainforests. Another mechanism has the Earth with little or no tilt to its axis\nof rotation, which removes seasonality and ensures light each day on each point of the\nglobe, coupled with a dense canopy that allows much more even temperatures despite\nvariation in latitude.\u201d!\u201d?\n\nAccording to Bernard Delair, theoretically, Earth ought to rotate on a vertical axis \u201cand\nmay actually have done so in the geologically recent past.\u201d'\u201d And: \u201cThere ought to be no\nreason why any Earth-like planet undisturbed for untold ages should not have a vertically-\npositioned axis.\u201d!74\n\nUnfortunately, there are various problems with the axial tilt hypothesis. To begin with,\nDelair\u2019s declaration did not go unchallenged. As Michael Reade pointed out, \u201ca spinning ball\nforced to traverse an elliptical orbit around a primary would adopt a tilted attitude.\u201d As he, in\nturn, assured his readers, \u201cit is never possible to get a free-spinning ball to spin with its axis\neither vertical or horizontal: the principal axis of the ball always settles to a well-defined and\nseemingly invariable angle of tilt.\u201d This, as Reade pointed out, \u201chas long been known to\nengineers: spinning bodies, such as turbines or speed governors, impose asymmetric stresses\non their shaft bearings.\u201d\u201d\u201d\n\nTrue, as Jane Francis noted, had Earth\u2019s axis been perpendicular to the plane of the\necliptic, the Sun would have bathed the polar regions with twelve hours of light every day. At\nthe poles, however, the Sun\u2019s rays would have been weak and low-angled, similar to those\nexperienced just before sunset. And this would have been insufficient for the growth of\nplants such as the remains of which have been discovered in polar regions.'?\n\nWhy not then propose a model which would combine both theories? Would not a\nperpendicular Earth orbiting around the Sun with Saturn stationed at Earth\u2019s north celestial\nsphere fill the bill? Not really because, for one thing, this would be contrary to what the my-\ntho-historical record has to tell us. We have seen that, time and again, the record states that,\nduring the age of semi-darkness, the Sun was not yet visible. And there is no point in ap-\npealing to the Pleiongaea hypothesis to account for this invisibility.

Ven-\nerian-like pressures at Earth\u2019s surface, let alone an even greater burden, would not have al-\nlowed the survival of terrestrial mammals including the human race.\n\nAt bottom lies this additional fact: While the axes of the Solar System planets point in\ndifferent directions, those of Saturn and Earth come close to coinciding. Saturn is tilted at\n26.7 degrees while Earth\u2019s tilt is at 23.45 degrees.\u2019 Both axes point to about the same spot\nin space. Saturn\u2019s present north star is the same as Earth\u2019s\u2014Polaris. This is a situation that\nwould be expected had Saturn and Earth once shared the same axis of rotation as our main\nthesis demands. What this seems to indicate is that, despite Delair\u2019s assurance to the contrary,\nEarth\u2019s present axial tilt is the most natural one for it to possess, and that it has not changed\nsince at least the Tertiary period.\n\nWhat then of a perpendicular axis with an Earth in phase-lock outside the Solar System\nas posited by Ken Croswell for red dwarf planets? This, too, fails to fill the bill because, as\nwe have already noted, while Croswell\u2019s theoretical system would entail a world without\nvariable seasons, it does not occasion one universal spring-like climate. True enough, the\nclimate would not have been variable, but tropical and equatorial regions would still have\nbeen much warmer than the poles. The poles, in fact, would have been the recipients of low\nslanting rays and if such slanting rays from our own Sun would have been inadequate to\nallow the thriving of sub-tropical flora and fauna at the poles, neither would the slanting rays\nfrom a red or brown dwarf star.\n\nWhat if we were to adapt Croswell\u2019s phase-locked system by having it encased within\nthe totally warm plasma sheath we have already postulated for the proto-Saturnian system?\nLight and warmth would then have reached all latitudes in equal proportion without having to\nrely on an axial alignment, already posited as the most difficult mechanical configuration to\nmaintain. In other words, why not adopt Wallace Thornhill\u2019s scenario wherewith Earth was\nin just such a positional situation and that it only \u201cbroke\u201d into polar alignment when it\nentered the Sun\u2019s influence? This, then, would make the Saturnian system\u2019s axial alignment a\nmere transitional event, which would be more amenable to celestial mechanics.\n\nAs already claimed, the encasing of the proto-Saturnian system in a plasmasphere is our\naccepted tenet. In the end, however, it may even be found that both postulates\u2014a denser\natmospheric envelope and a plasma sheath\u2014are quite compatible with each other since a\ndenser terrestrial atmospheric envelope might have existed within the Saturnian plasma\nsheath. We would thus have a situation in which the light and heat from the proto-Saturnian\nsun would have been reflected back, or otherwise radiated outward and inward, from the\nplasma sheath and dissipated evenly through the greenhouse property of Earth\u2019s denser\natmosphere.\n\n4 Actually, the tilt of Mars, at 25.2 degrees, is even closer to Saturn\u2019s\u2014 but of Mars we will speak in a separate\nvolume.\n\n381",

This theory also\nexplained the resemblance noted by Heer of the Tertiary flora of Europe and the Re-\ncent flora of eastern Asia and Atlantic North America.\u201d*\n\nAs Johnson noted, while Heer\u2019s theory dates to the late 19th century, his \u201cnotion of an\nArctic evolutionary cradle is startlingly modern, in line with the work of Dawson and\nHickey\u201d to which we shall come anon.\n\nE. C. Pielou, on the other hand, reminded her readers of photoperiodism which presents\nan \u201capparent obstacle to long, northward and southward migration of plants\u201d since such\nmigrations would have moved said plants out of their physiological niche.\" Long-day\nplants, for instance, cannot survive in the tropics, while short-day plants cannot thrive in\nmore northern latitudes. This is because the photoperiodic length varies from latitude to lati-\ntude and from season to season. Because day and night lengths in the tropics approximate\ntwelve hours each all year round, photoperiodic variations are small to non-existent. In the\nmid-temperate regions, photoperiodic spans can vary from up to nine hours in December to\nup to sixteen hours in June. In the present Arctic regions, photoperiodicity drops to zero in\nDecember, rising as high as twenty-four hours in June.\n\nAll this, however, would have been of very little, if any, importance during the Tertiary if\nEarth had basked under a continuous and universal sub-tropical climate and light regime as\nseems to be indicated by the evidence presented above. In the case at hand, the climatic\nrequirements would have been close to identical the world over. Migrating plants would not\nhave had to vacate any physiological niches; they would merely have radiated into new areas\nthe climatic properties of which would have been near identical to the ones of their origin.\n\nIn the end, it is the available evidence that counts. Does the evidence support the theory\nof a Tertiary plant migration from the Arctic into more southerly latitudes?

And even if this time span would have to be\ndrastically shortened, as it probably wil! have to be, sometime in the future, it remains evi-\ndent that the situation we have described would have to have prevailed from long before the\nadvent of man.",
