In Sumerian, this \u201cbond\u201d is\ntermed dimgal, which is fairly translatable as \u201cgreat binding-post.\u201d \"8 Furthermore, this dim-\ngal is also used in reference to the abzu,'\"\u00b0 or Apsu, that is the celestial waters we have seen\nassociated with proto-Saturn. To clinch the matter further, Kronos/Saturn himself is ad-\ndressed in an Orphic hymn as the \u201cFather of the blessed gods...you who hold the indestruc-\ntible bond according to the unlimited order of Aion...\u201d!29\n\nWe have additionally seen that Aion himself was only an aspect of Saturn. And, since the\nRoman Janus was also identified by the ancients themselves as Saturnus, it does not surprise\nus that the same Janus has also been equated with Aion. '2! As R. Reitzenstein claimed, under\nthe influence of Aion, Janus became the ruler of the cosmic axis. !22 This, of course, harks\nback to Ovid who considered Janus as the connecting link between the upper and lower re-\ngions, and said of him to have ruled over the constantly turning axis of the cosmos. !23\n\nThe Hindu Vishnu, too, was said to have been \u201cerected as the pillar of heaven\u201d in which\nform he protected the firmament.!% \u201cThou proppedst asunder these two worlds\u201d is the man-\nner in which the god is addressed. !25 He is thus referred to as the one \u201cwho propped the up-\nper seat,\u201d!26\n\nIn Japanese mythology, the sky pillar is compared to a reed. Thus it was written:\n\n\u201cAt this time a certain thing was produced between Heaven and Earth. It was in form\nlike a reed-shoot.\u201d!27\n\nElsewhere in Japanese lore it is stated that:\n\n\u201cBefore Heaven and Earth were produced, there was something which might be com-\npared to a cloud floating over the sea [our placental cloud]. It had no place of attach-\nment for its root. In the midst of this a thing was generated which resembled a reed-\nshoot. ..\u201d128\n\nIn the Yuki myth of Creation, the sky pillar is represented as a rope. Taik\u00e9-mol, the\ncreator whom we have already met in association with the fog and foam that existed over the\ncelestial waters, is said to have \u201cstood on the foam, which still revolved.\u201d As it is said, and in\nkeeping with our hypothesis, there was no light at this time. But Taik\u00e9-mol \u201cwalked\u201d over\nthe water \u201cas if it were land.\u201d It was then that he \u201cmade a rope and laid it from north to\nsouth,\u201d 129\n\nNot surprisingly, among the Kwakiutl of America\u2019s Northwest Coast, the cosmic pillar\nwas envisioned, and represented, as atotem pole, the name of which was Kalakuyuwish,\n\n117g. de Santillana & H. von Dechend, op. cit., p. 133.\n\n8 ypid., p. 413.\n\n119 Ibid.\n\n120 fid., pp. 132-133.\n\n121 R.

As he continues to inform us:\n\n\u201cMany peoples of the Near East and the Mediterranean area believed that the\nsun...was the primary source for the quintessence of life. It was the sun\u2019s light, re-\nflected upon the face of the moon, that brought fertility and life to the soil by way of\nthe whirling lunar shadow...\u201d'51\n\nOne, however, is immediately bound to ask: What has moonshine to do with the concept\nof a sky pillar? And in what manner can the shadow of the Moon be said to whirl? Suhr ex-\nplains:\n\n\u201cAt the top, the column must have been in contact with the sun and the moon, the two\nbodies from which it derived most of its life principle...Of course, the two bodies\nwere not always directly above one another, but the sun in ancient astronomy was al-\nways exerting an influence on the moon from above, and both influenced the\nearth\u2014 which made the columnar form symbolically suitable.\u201d'2\n\nAnd:\n\n\u201cWhether we think of the column as a shaft grounded in the earth or as the cone-\nshaped shadow of the moon, its lower extremity appears to penetrate the earth...\u201d 153\n\nHere, then, is Suhr\u2019s answer to this old enigma. According to him, the notion of the sky\npillar was derived from the conical shadow the Moon casts in space, which shadow termi-\nnates on Earth, during a solar eclipse.!*4 As he pointed out in a different work, \u201csurely a\nshadow from a body ranging somewhere between the sun and the earth and making an occa-\nsional direct contact with the earth must have been, for the ancient mind, a projection of di-\nvine beneficence.\u201d!55\n\nAs we have seen, the real nature of solar eclipses was known to the ancient Greeks. To\nrepeat what we have said on a previous page, both Plutarch and Pliny knew that lunar\neclipses were caused by the projection of Earth\u2019s shadow on the lunar surface, and that this\nprojection took the form of a cone, which, as Suhr himself explained, would have been \u201can\nobservation based on what the naked eye could see\u201d plus \u201ca simple deduction from a law of\nphysics.\u201d!5\u00a2 As Suhr correctly deduced: \u201cif the ancients were aware of the earth\u2019s shadow,\nthey must also have known, as Diodorus testifies, about that of the moon projected toward\nthe earth during a solar eclipse...\u201d157\n\nBut, while all of this is true, it can hardly be said that this was also known to our\nprimitive forefathers who would not have been capable of any \u201csimple deduction from a law\n\n150 Ibid, p. 71\n\n131 Jid., p. 111.\n\n132 Jbid., p. 71.\n\n133 Jid., p. 72.\n\n134 See here also, ibid., p. 114.\n\n155, p. 54.\n156 Ibid., p. 53.\n\n157 Ibid.\n\n453",

                "content": "through precession was the beginning of a new world age.\n\nit has, however, long been understood that most of mythology derives from primitive\ntimes, from those eras preceding the birth of writing. It is therefore difficult to accept that the\nprimitive mind of ages past had already noted the extremely slow change of the pole, let\nalone that the change was understood. De Santillana and von Dechend were, of course, quite\naware of this objection, so it is not surprising that they attempted to overrule it.\n\nAs noted earlier, the discovery of the precession of the equinoxes has long been attributed\nto Hipparchus, one of the greatest astronomers and mathematicians of antiquity, who\nflourished sometime between 146 and 127 B.C. Yet\u2014or so the authors of Hamilet\u2019s Mill\nargued\u2014this does not prove that the phenomenon had not been observed prior to his time.\nUnfortunately, other than that their theory demands it, this premise is not warranted by the\nrecord and the authors in question must therefore stand accused of reading into that record\nwhat is not really there.\n\nWhat is worse is that even were we to grant that the phenomenon had been known since\nprimitive times, it remains difficult to accept that this extremely slow change, the perception\nof which requires thousands of years, could have given rise to a world-wide belief in the\ncataclysmic end of all things\u2014with flood and fire and the shaking of the terrestrial globe it-\nself\u2014as these authors maintain. After all, when one pole star is displaced by another, no dis-\naster ensues, either in heaven or here on Earth.\n\nMore important is the fact\u2014and the authors in question were well aware of this\u2014that\ncertain items of myth and ancient astronomical lore not only refuse to fit the precessional\nscheme of the equinoxes but, as we have seen, are notorious in not fitting anything else that\nwe presently witness in our Solar System. With the vast amount of research that went into\ntheir work, they were bound to run headlong into the ancient notion that the planet Saturn\nhad once played the role of pole star. Not knowing what to do with this datum, they ended up\nrelegating it to the limbo of unacceptable data.\n\nAll this has been brought up here because, needless to say, the authors in question were\nalso bound to run headlong into what they themselves termed the polar axis. So how did they\nattempt to fit this entity into their precessional scheme? Somewhat ambiguously, they tell us\nthat:\n\n\u201cThe rotation of the polar axis must not be disjointed from the great circles which\nshift along with it in heaven. The framework is thought of as all one with the axis.\u201d158\n\nAs they explain on an earlier page, the axis mundi should be understood as \u201cthe equinoc-\ntial colure which \u2018accompanies\u2019 the slowly turning, wholly abstract and invisible axis along\nthe surface of the sphere.\u201d !59 By this they meant the imaginary line running from Earth\u2019s\ngeographical pole to the pole of the ecliptic, the centre around which Earth\u2019s axis revolves\nonce every 26,000 years \u2014in other words, the imaginary pole around which the precession of\nthe equinoxes takes place.\n\nWhat is highly interesting is that even they found this somewhat hard to swallow. As they\ntell us: \u201cThe abstract idea of a simple earth axis, so natural today, was by no means so logical\nto the ancients ...\"160\n\nThat being so, why is it we find so many allusions to this pole in the mythologies of all\nraces and in such varied dress? Why would a \u201cwholly abstract and invisible axis,\u201d like Suhr\u2019s\n\n138 G_ de Santillana & H. von Dechend, op. cit., p. 231.\n159 Ibid., p. 159.\n160 fbid., p, 232.\n\n455",

                "content": "As we have seen, the Egyptian Shu was described as light personified, which light acted\nas a prop of the sky. Osiris/Saturn was lauded as having occupied a position above the leg of\nheaven, which leg was described as a \u201cleg of fire.\u201d The Christian Sibyilines called the piilar\nof the sky a \u201cpillar of glory.\u201d We have seen that the rendering of the Egyptian kau and/or\nkhut, the heaven-sustaining column, utilizes a hieroglyphic character which translates as\n\u201cvertical streamers of light ascending the world axis.\u201d Through Sanskrit, we have even as-\ncertained that this imperishable pivot, or post, was thought of as a fiery axis. The message\nseems clear enough: Although the direction of the light was interpreted differently by differ-\nent peoples\u2014i.e., ascending or descending\u2014 what the ancients purport to have seen was ex-\nactly what Hippolytus described as \u201cthe downward flow of light from above\u201d and as \u201ca ray\ncoming from above.\u201d Even Plato had reason to describe it as \u201ca straight light like a pillar\u201d\nwhich has been understood as \u201cstretching along the axis of the cosmos,\u201d !*! while others have\npresented it as \u201ca cylinder of aetherial fire surrounding the axis.\u201d!\u00ae In other words, the phe-\nnomenon can be stated to have been a ray of fiery light which stretched all the way from the\nproto-Saturnian planet to Earth\u2019s geographical north pole, a pillar of light which appeared to\nsupport heaven and/or the proto-planetary orb of Saturn above it.\n\nBut why a wind? What was there in this pillar of light that lent itself analogously to a\nwind, even a whirlwind no less?\n\nAt this point one is bound to think of our posited circumstellar or placental cloud which,\nas we have seen in an earlier chapter, was inter alia described as a fog or foam which\n\u201cmoved round and round continually,\u201d a whirling \u201cprimeval void,\u201d a chaos which \u201cheaved\u201d\nand \u201cturned\u201d in darkness, the \u201ceternally revolving\u201d Tao of the Chinese, remembered by the\nDogon as the spinning and dancing Amma, whirling around while organizing the \u201cworld\u201d out\nof chaos, and/or the Norse Aesir who established their seat on the \u201cwhirl-field.\u201d Does this\nnot, in fact, accord well with Sanchoniathon\u2019s \u201cbreeze of thick air,\u201d to say nothing of Ehe-\ncatl\u2019s identity as the \u201cwheel of the winds,\u201d illustrated so graphically by the interior design of\na sliced conch shell which served as his symbol? Might it not therefore be that the analogous\nconception of the axis mundi as a whirlwind derived from its physical association with the\nwhirling placental cloud in question?\n\nIt \u00e9s possible that the whirling placental cloud could have added to the analogy of the axis\nas a whirlwind but, for one thing, the circumstellar cloud would have appeared as a nebular\ndisk around proto-Saturn, and not as a fiery pillar supporting that orb. For another, as we\nhave also documented, ancient accounts seem to leave no doubt that the axis itself was seen\nto whirl\u2014and so has it been understood by past mythologists regardless of their blundering\nattempts in interpreting it. We shall have much more to say concerning the axis mundi and its\ndestructive whirling antics as it evolved through time in future volumes,!\u00a9 but enough has\nbeen said here to make the point.\n\n161 A,B.

                "content": "nothing perplexed me more than this effulgent ray of light stretching between our humble\n\nabode and Satum\u2019s glorious realm. Right from day one, David Talbott had understood it\nas a luminescent stream of falling debris.! One reason I could not accept this interpretation\ncame from the lack of recognizable cosmic material in Earth\u2019s Arctic regions. Let\u2019s face it, if\nthe polar column was really composed of material ejected from a stationary planet located in\nEarth\u2019s north celestial pole, and since the column is posited to have existed for possible mil-\nlennia, such constant bombardment should have strewn Earth\u2019s Arctic regions with cosmic\ndetritus.2\n\nSince then, however, such material has been found in Arctic regions. Thus, for instance,\n\u201ca large fall of iron meteorites\u201d is now believed to have occurred in northwestern Greenland\nand the adjacent east coast of Ellesmere Island \u201cat some undetermined time in the past.\u201d It is\nnow apparent that this cosmic iron \u201c\u2018was discovered by the late Dorset people during the few\ncenturies immediately preceding A.D. 1000, and small pieces of meteoric iron are found on\nDorset sites of this period.\u201d3 The meteoric iron from northwesten Greenland \u201cspread\n[through trade] at least as far west as Bathurst Island and Little Cornwallis Island and south\nto the northern part of Hudson[\u2018s] Bay.\u201d4 Even so, this is hardly the amount of cosmic mate-\nrial one expects to discover in Arctic regions, especially the area in and around the pole, if\nthe debris had been raining down for millennia. Granted that no one has yet conducted a de-\nliberate search for such material, not enough has yet come to light from this area to satisfy\nTalbott\u2019s interpretation.\n\nLynn Rose, on the other hand, compared the cosmic pillar to the flux tube which stretches\nbetween Jupiter and its satellite, [o.5 This is a stream of electrons\u2014a 5 million amp, 400,000\nvolt current, which translates into 2 trillion watts of energy\u00b0\u2014that flows in a wide arc from\nboth Jupiter\u2019s poles to Io\u2019s. And, to be sure, I had toyed with this idea myself. But I soon dis-\ncarded it because, while instrumentally detectable, and even photographable through exotic\nlight, Io\u2019s flux tube is not optically visible.\n\nMeanwhile, Frederic Jueneman saw this axis as a colossal Rankine vortex, a cosmic tor-\nnado of planetary proportions, composed mainly of air and water vapor.\u2019 Although his model!\n\nle the beginning, as I slowly reconstructed the Saturnian model and its attendant scenario,\n\n1, p. 214; but see also, idem, Symbols of an Alien Sky (Beaverton,\nOregon, 1997), p. 100.\n\n2 See here also, D.
