It is a complete history...of the nature of an intense\nplasma occurrence in the Solar System as it once was at a time when mankind was present to\nrecord it...God Star delineates mythology from fable, setting the former as a true field of\nscientific enquiry. From God Star springs forth topic after topic on the physical conditions and\nprocesses our planet has undergone...”\nAnthony L. Peratt, B.S.E.E., M.S.E.E., Ph.D\n(Former Scientific Advisor, United States Department of Energy)\nFlare Star\n(2007)\n“Flare Star is essential reading for anyone interested in geology, archaeology, paleontology,\nand/or the recent history of the Solar System. Cardona correlates information from astrono-\nmers, geologists, plasma scientists, and from comparative mythologists to demonstrate that\nthey use different methods but come to many similar conclusions. He notes several known\nproblems in science that are not often stressed outside the scientific community and then pro-\nvides possible explanations to said problems with one basic assumption concerning the origi-\nnal plasma environment around Earth,..Although Cardona’s God Star was first in the se-\nries...a reader would not be lost starting with Flare Star. They compliment each other and\nboth are very important books.”\nC. J. Ransom, Ph.D\n(Plasma Physicist, University of Texas at Austin)\niii",

They were\nnot wrong. As strange as it may sound to those who have not read our previous vol-\numes on the subject,? our present Sun is not the same sun which bathed Earth in primordial\ntimes. It therefore follows that the geological history of our world as presently taught cannot\nbe entirely correct. Neither can the history of our Solar System. One need not even accept the\nabove hypothesis in order to recognize the truth of this. Astrophysicists themselves have been\nharping on this reality for years. It has, for instance, been admitted that it’s no longer known\nhow planets manage to form. Discoveries that have come to light while this book was being\nwritten have shown that “the planet-building process is far wilder, messier, and more varied\nthan anyone expected.” According to the astrophysicist Adam Frank: “The truth is that\nastronomers still do not know much about the origin of planets” and that, when compared to\nextra-solar systems, ours “is something of an oddball.”* More than that, where planets were\nonce thought to take millions of years to develop, it has now been calculated that extra-solar\nplanets could “have formed no more than a few hundred thousand years ago.”> Bodies the size\nof Jupiter, it has been claimed, can “pull together in just a few hundred years.” Under certain\nconditions, they can “possibly” even form “in a single human lifetime.”\nThe unfortunate part about all this is that the above conclusions have been based on the\nbelief that planets accrete out of the debris contained in circumstellar disks, which disks are\noften thus referred to as accretion disks. But that planets cannot form in this manner has been\nadmitted by quite a few authorities.’ Objections to the theory had been voiced as early as 1960\nby the then Astronomer Royal of Great Britain, W. H. McCrea. Calculations had shown him\nthat it is impossible for the terrestrial planets —that is, Mars, Earth, Venus, and Mercury —to\nhave formed where they are presently found inside the orbit of Jupiter.
