So let us then, in closing this work, take a closer\nlook at this particular postulate of ours.\nOUR CHAOTIC NEIGHBORHOOD\nIf the conclusions that resulted from Jacques Laskar’s investigation of the Solar System’s\nlong-term stability that he conducted for the Parisian-based Bureau des Longitudes have any\nvalidity, it will turn out that the Sun’s original planetary family had been much more\nnumerous than it is at present. For one thing, calculations conducted with high-speed\ncomputers have indicated that the Solar System is only marginally stable—‘“dangerously close\nto instability,” actually! —and that “its detailed behavior is fundamentally unpredictable over\nlong time periods.”? Very much like the old aphorism which claims that a change of weather\nin North America can be attributed to the fluttering of a butterfly’s wings in China, the most\ntrivial of disturbances in a system like ours could, in time, profoundly change its very\nconfiguration.? From this and other deduced characteristics, Laskar concluded that the Solar\nSystem had to have been close to the edge of instability at every stage of its evolutionary\nprocess. And, in order to have maintained its marginal stability until the present, the System\nmust have been eliminating bodies “on a timescale comparable with its age at every epoch.”\nFrom which it follows that the Sun’s family “may have contained more planets than it does\nnow.”4\nThe above might therefore seem to fly in the face of our scenario, because if proto-Saturn\nreally infiltrated the Solar System, it would have increased, rather than lessened, the Sun’s\nplanetary family. Laskar’s conclusions, however, are based on the orbital retrocalculation of\nthe planets which he believes to have accreted from the Sun’s circumstellar disk.5 That the\nformation of planets from gas disks is a theory rife with problems need not be re-stressed. As\nfor retrocalculation, Laskar himself has admitted that the eccentricities inherent in planetary\norbits make it impossible to calculate the locations of the planets after a hundred million\nyears.® But even that safety margin will not save Laskar’s conclusions. The retrocalculation of\nplanetary orbits simply does not work.? Lynn Rose and Raymond Vaughan actually laid this\nbeast to rest by using the launching of a spacecraft as an example. Retrocalculation of a\nspacecraft’s orbit after launching would show where that spacecraft would have been located\nin outer space when it was actually still on its launching pad.®",

        "content": "The idea that planets can be flung out of systems is not entirely new. In fact, it has been\ntheorized that free-floating planets “could be the most plentiful objects in our galaxy.”! Some\nof these free-floaters had for long been surmised to have been banished from their stellar\nhosts’ environment. But the reverse has also now been postulated. Similar to what we have\nclaimed in this work and its two prequels concerning the proto-Saturnian system, it is now\nbelieved that some of these “intriguing objects...may be captured into orbit around stars and\ncreate planetary systems indistinguishable from true solar systems.”?\n\nPlanets, to say nothing of brown dwarfs, are not however the only lonesome bodies\nroaming around in space. Even stars are known to have been ejected from their galaxies.\nSome stars are actually being flung out of our own Milky Way.? One of them is speeding out\nso fast it has left astronomers in a tizzy.4\n\nYet even then, had the original Solar System contained more planets than it does at\npresent, there is nothing that could have kept stray bodies—and even entire systems—from\ninvading our Sun’s domain. The traffic in our galactic neighborhood is actually quite heavy.\n\nThere are two vital areas of this neighborhood that bear directly on the matter at hand. One\nof these is the vastness of the Galaxy itself which is hardly the peaceful system it was once\nbelieved to be. It is bad enough that the stars in its bulbous core have been theorized to be\norbiting rather furiously around the disk’s center. But at the disk’s periphery is an additional\nhalo of stars most of which do not behave in an orderly fashion. To make matters even worse,\nthis outer halo has been found to consist of two distinct parts, one of which rotates backwards.\nAnd as if that is not already drastic, these two distinct parts overlap one another. We thus end\nup with an area where stars are orbiting in different directions along each others’ paths.®\n\nThe other vital area is the Solar System’s outer fringe, that is the Kuiper belt, which\ncontinues to confound those who are presently investigating its vague boundaries. As reported\nat the end of 2007: “The farthest reaches of our solar system remain the most mysterious areas\naround the sun.”7 And yet it has become apparent that solving the mysteries of these reaches\n“could shed light on how the whole thing emerged—as well as how life on earth was born.”8\n\nThe Kuiper belt is home to various objects. As of this writing, one thousand and fifty-five\nof them have been catalogued. It has been estimated that there must be millions of others\nwaiting to be discovered.? Quite a few of these bodies bear the orbital imprint of having been\ndisrupted. Most astronomers actually think that the ensuing disorder was due to a “large\nmassive object that existed in, or blundered through, the outer system soon after the planets",

Nor is it the only such hook since a similar one is\nalso linking up with us from the Small Magellanic Cloud, bringing all three galaxies closer\ntogether. Rather than zooming past us, these two smaller galaxies will eventually merge with\nour own Milky Way.! If this turns out to be so, it becomes quite evident that, despite those\nstars which are being tossed out, others are also moving into the outer regions of our Galaxy.\nAt this point I wish I could say that that is all the foreign traffic that careens in and out of\nour Galaxy, but, as the following section will indicate, the flood of alien visitors is much more\nheavy and complicated than that.\nSTRANGERS IN A FOREIGN GALAXY\nAn entire galaxy, now named Sagittarius, was discovered, almost accidentally, by Rodrigo\nIbata while still a graduate student at Cambridge University in 1994. Despite the fact that\nSagittarius is a significant satellite of the Milky Way, no one had noticed it before. This is\nbecause most of its stars are obscured from view in visible light and can only be detected by\ninstruments sensitive to infrared. Detection was made even more difficult since, as mentioned\nat the beginning of this volume (see page 8), the stars of Sagittarius are now actually mixed\nwith those of our own Galaxy. Ibata discovered this new galaxy when the stellar spectra he\nwas collecting at the Anglo-Australian Telescope in Australia revealed a bevy of red stars that\nwere moving together as a whole against the background of the Milky Way.”\n“If people had infrared-sensitive eyes [Steven Majewski from the University of Vir-\nginia reported], the entrails of Sagittarius would be a prominent fixture sweeping\nacross the sky. But at human, visual wavelengths, they become buried among count-\nless intervening stars and obscuring dust.”3\nSagittarius and our Galaxy are even now merging with one another.4 Moving almost\nperpendicular to the Milky Way’s ecliptic plane,> the foreign galaxy seems to be cutting\nstraight through ours. Or, as others would have it, thousands of stars from Sagittarius, which is\nalready a mere vestige of its former self, are being cannibalized by the bullying Milky Way.\n“After slow, continuous gnawing by the Milky Way [said Martin Weinberg from the\nUniversity of Massachusetts], Sagittarius has been whittled down to the point that it\ncannot hold itself together much longer. We are seeing Sagittarius at the very end of\nits life as an intact system.”6",

Other stolen clusters\nand individual stars may exist, but they’re already so well mixed in with the Milky\nWay’s own that astronomers can’t trace their origins.”?\nWhat is more important to our study is that Sagittarius is slicing the Milky Way through\nthe very region which harbors our Solar System. “Remarkably, stars from Sagittarius are now\nraining down onto our present position in the Milky Way,” Majewski reported further. “Stars\nfrom an alien galaxy are relatively near us.”\nVarious hyped media channels that reported this event went one step further in claiming\nthat our Solar System actually belongs to the Sagittarius galaxy rather than the Milky Way.\nThis raised quite a hullabaloo among those involved in the study, who then had to stress that\nnone of them had ever claimed as much. All of which forced certain online publications to\nretract previous reports and apologize to their readers.*\nEven so, there are certain matters that should be kept in mind. For one thing, it has always\nseemed somewhat odd to many observers that the Milky Way is at an oblique tilt when com-\npared to the Solar System’s plane of the ecliptic. As viewed from Earth, the Milky Way an-\ngles acutely across the darkened sky. Astrophysicists will of course tell us that planetary\nsystems do not necessarily have to align their ecliptic planes with those of the galaxies they\ninhabit. On the other hand, such oblique axes, which is what tilted planes amount to, are usu-\nally attributed, by astrophysicists themselves, to collisions or other catastrophic interactions—\nas notice the case with the ninety-eight degree tilt of the planet Uranus and its satellites.\nAdditional to that is the recent discovery that the Solar System is hurtling through space at a\nnear-perpendicular angle to the plane of the Milky Way.® “It’s almost like we’re sailing\nthrough the galaxy sideways,” Merav Opher, from the George Mason University in Virginia,\nreported.’ And, as it happens, the Sagittarius galaxy is not only cutting through the Milky\nWay through the very area occupied by our Solar System, but, judging by the pictorial\nsimulations that have so far been published, and as already noted, it is doing so at right angles\nto it. All of which implies that the Solar System is much better aligned with the ecliptic plane\nof the Sagittarius galaxy. Does not this additionally suggest that the Solar System really\nbelongs to Sagittarius? The question is: Has Earth always done so?",

And\nalthough it has not yet been ascertained one way or the other, there is the possibility that these\noccurrences are due to some intrinsic properties within the dwarfs themselves.\nIt must, however, be pointed out, as Wallace Thornhill has more than once stressed, that\nstellar and sub-stellar flares are best explained through a change in the electrical charge of the\nbodies in question which can be brought about through more than one possibility. As already\nindicated, one of these would entail the passage of such a body from one plasma cell into\nanother, which would involve a change in electrical potential. Frederic Jueneman, on the other\nhand, very much doubts that a sub-stellar body like proto-Saturn would have been able to\ntraverse through different plasma cells within its given galactic life time.?\nIn the meantime, despite our previous admonition that proto-Saturn’s entry into the Solar\nSystem could only have transpired once,* there is still the possibility that its plasmasphere\ncould have brushed against the Sun’s heliosphere time and again through what Jueneman has\nreferred to as a “wide-ranging orbital ephemeris before final capture,”> which Thornhill had\nalso earlier suggested.6\nBut while the above seems somewhat possible in view of the Sagittarius galaxy’s\ninteraction with our own, it will not account for the outbursts experienced by all those other\nstellar dwarfs roaming solitarily through interstellar space. In that respect, the crossing of\nthese bodies from one plasmatic cell into another of different electrical potential seems best to\nfit the bill. The clashing of such plasma sheaths would then also be in keeping with proto-\nSaturn’s plasmaspheric contact with the Sun’s heliospheric shell.\nWhile the actual mechanism responsible for these discharges might be more complex than\nany of the above theories intimate, there is no doubt in this writer’s mind that a sub-stellar\nflare was generated by proto-Saturn’s entry into our present Sun’s electrical domain of\ninfluence, and that this discharge was the cause of the terrestrial catastrophes associated with\nthe end of the Pleistocene.’ What we so far have left unsaid is that Earth was not alone in\nsuffering this adversity. Heaven, too, was forced to undergo tremendous changes. Mankind’s\nsolitary deity had roused himself from his age-old slumber.
