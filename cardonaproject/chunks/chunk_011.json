The Evening Star\nVenus, with its irregular course, the first to appear and the last to fade, caught their\neye. The Maya strived [sic.] to measure its height which varies at sunrise and sun-\nset...All of these preoccupations, which went far beyond those required to compile an\nagrarian calendar, showed their obsessive interest in infinity\u2014-whether of time or\nspace\u2014and also an anxiety in the face of the passage of time.\u201d\n\nThe astronomical observations of the Maya were so precise that the figures they arrived at\nin computing the solar year were not only more accurate than the Julian year, but, as some\nhave claimed, also more accurate than the Gregorian year which was introduced into Europe\nin 1582 and remains the calendar year until the present.\u201d\n\nMesoamerican calendars were not produced by any one person in any single generation.\nTheir development and refinement was the product of centuries. In fact, their basic elements\ncan be traced as far back as the Olmec, who had established their cities and ceremonial cen-\ntres in Mexico\u2019s Gulf Coast \u201cat least as early as the second century B. C.\u201d* In time\u2014pun not\nintended\u2014these calendars evolved into an intricate system in which several different time\ncycles, all of which were calculated independently and with similar exactitude, were incorpo-\nrated in various combinations, relating one cycle to another, in their utilization of time meas-\nurement.\u201d\n\nOne particular calendar employed by the Maya, called Haab, was based on a 360-day\ncount and was divided into 18 months of 20 days each, to which five days\u2014believed to be\n\n\u201cmalefic, ill-omened, empty, and nameless\u201d*\u2014were added at the end to bring the year to a\ntotal of 365 days.\n\nWhile the 365-day calendar, which in time became the common property of all\nMesoamerican peoples, has been attested in inscriptions as early as 667 B.C.,\" Edmonson\ntells us that the 360-day calendar did not come into use by the Olmecs earlier \u2018than the first\ncentury B.C.,\u00ae that is some 300 years after the inauguration of the 365-day one. I mention\nthis here in passing because, if Edmonson is correct, Immanuel Velikovsky\u2019s contention that\nthe 365-day calendar followed the 360-day_ one\u00ae has to be wrong.\n\nA somewhat simpler, but more mysterious, calendar, said to have been called Tzolkin by\nthe Maya, but Tonalamatl by the Aztecs, was composed of 260 days divided into 13 months\nof 20 days each. Usually referred to as the sacred calendar because it was used to keep the\nreligious festivals in line with the proper seasons, the Tzolkin has been demoted to a mere\ndivinatory program by students of Mesoamerican culture.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Vincent Maimstr\u00e9m has attempted to show that this 260-day calendar was\nactually even older than the Maya. Said to have been originally developed for agrarian pur-\nposes, Malmstr\u00e9m contends that this calendar owed its origin to the Zoque of Mexico\u2019s Pa-\ncific coastal plain and that it marks the interval between passages of the Sun at its zenith over\n\n* G.

                "content": "Of all the celestial bodies that the Mesoamericans observed, the planet Venus seems\nwithout doubt to have been considered the most important. Called, among other things, the\nGreat, or Ancient, Star, it is repeatedly alluded to in the extant codices. Ram\u00e9n y Zamora,\nwho studied the lore of the Mexican tribes only a few decades after the re-discovery of\nAmerica, was astounded to discover that the Indians kept a precise record of the appearances\nof this planet. \u201cSo accurately did they keep the record of the days when it appeared and dis-\nappeared,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat they never made a mistake.\u201d\u201d Toribo Motolina added that \u201cthey\nknew on what day it would appear again in the east after it had lost itself or disappeared in\nthe west\u201d and that \u201cthey counted the days by this star and yielded reverence and offered sac-\ntifices to it.\u201d*\n\nThe Dresden Codex of the Maya includes a complete record of the apparition of this\nplanet in its cycle from Moming to Evening Star, recorded in the dot and bar mathematical\nsymbols which they employed (in which a dot signifies 1, and a bar stands for 5, with an\noval\u2014a stylized seashell, really\u2014for the concept of zero}. Intervals indicating the elapsed\ntime between successive heliacal risings are there recorded. This interval of time was calcu-\nlated by them as a period of 584 days which the Maya subdivided into four subintervals: the\nappearance of the planet as Moming Star; its appearance as Evening Star; its disappearance\nin front of the Sun; and its disappearance behind the Sun.\u201d\n\nVenus takes 224.7 days to complete one circuit around the Sun. As seen from Earth,\nhowever, it appears to take 583.92 days to complete one circuit. This is because Earth, too, is\nmoving in the same direction. This apparent time-span is known as the synodic period. As\nnoted above, the Mesoamericans calculated the Venerian synodic year as 584 days,\u201d which,\nwhen compared to the modern value of 583.92 days, discloses an error of less than one hour\n\nSv. H.

It is easily forgotten by the\nlayman that one cannot easily view the Sun directly without some form of optic protection\nexcept during its risings and settings. Of course, it could also be argued that the Chinese, who\nwere so adept at just about everything, could have utilized dark, or smoked, glass in order to\nenable them to view sunspots. Actually, not even a smoked glass would have been necessary.\nDespite the fact that the Sun cannot be viewed directly for any length of time with the un-\naided eye, it can be viewed indirectly when it is shielded by haze or thin clouds. As John\nGribbin noted, it is hardly surprising that those Chinese records which mention sunspots\n\u201cvery often comment at the same time that the brightness of the Sun was reduced.\u201d* As\nGribbin explained: \u201cThis does not imply that the Sun itself was dim, but that dust or haze in\nthe atmosphere was obscuring its light and making it possible to pick out the spots against the\nglare of the solar disk.\u201d\u00ae Had sunspots been as easily detected with the unaided eye as some\nwould think, it would not, in Europe, have taken ti!l the early seventeenth century for them to\nbe re-discovered. One of the reasons why Galileo was persecuted by the Catholic Church was\nhis insistence that the Sun often exhibits such blemishes on its surface. Prior to that, one of\nthe central dogmas of the Church was that the Sun, having been created by God, had to be a\nperfect sphere. \u201c{SJuggesting imperfection in the Sun was seen in some quarters as implying\nthat God could be fallible and was guilty of shoddy workmanship.\u201d And yet, even before\nthe Chinese, sunspots had long been known to the ancient Greeks.",

                "content": "Claudius Ptolemaeus, popularly known simply as Ptolemy, was the most celebrated geog-\ntapher, mathematician, and astronomer prior to medieval times. More than that, he has often\nbeen referred to as \u201cthe greatest astronomer of antiquity.\u201d Unfortunately, despite some\nArabian traditions concerning his personal appearance and the report that he lived to the ripe\nold age of 78 years, nothing much is known about the man himself. Whether his name,\nPtolemaeus, derived from that of the Greek city in which he was said to have been born,\nPtolemais Hermii, or whether, as Kenneth Heuer assumes, it \u201cindicates that he was an in-\nhabitant of Egypt of Greek or Macedonian [that is, Ptolemaic] descent,\u201d*\u00ae cannot now be as-\ncertained.\n\nWhat seemed to have been certain until recently is that he conducted his astronomical ob-\nservations at Alexandria, in Egypt, sometime during the years 127 and 141 or 151 A.D. The\nbelief among more modem historians of science, however, is that Ptolemy conducted most of\nhis observing \u201cnot at night on the coast of Egypt but during the day in the great library at Al-\nexandria, where he appropriated the work of a Greek astronomer [Hipparchus] and proceeded\nto call it his own.\u201d\n\nOf his works on geography and mathematics, I shall say nothing here, concentrating in-\nstead, and then only briefly, on his astronomical observations and theories. These were pre-\nsented in thirteen books originally titled Synraxis, but later referred to by the Arabs as Al-\nmagest, which means \u201cThe Greatest,\u201d the name by which the work is now more commonly\nalluded to. For better or worse, this work \u201cwas accepted as the final authority on the subject\nuntil it was superseded by the observations of the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus in\nthe 16th century.\u201d\"\u201d\n\nWhat Ptolemy concluded from his so-called observations of the heavens was that the\nheavenly bodies moved in circular orbits and that Earth, already known by then to be spheri-\ncal in shape, was at the centre of the universe. He calculated the periods of revolution, as well\nas the apparent retrogradation, of the five planets visible to the unaided eye, the inclination of\ntheir orbits, and their motions in latitude. He compiled a catalogue of the stars visible in both\nthe northern and southern hemispheres, listed under constellations, giving their apparent\nmagnitudes, latitudes, and longitudes, which stars numbered 1,022 as\ncompared with the 850 or so that were contained in the earlier catalogue of Hipparchus.\n\nMuch of the Almagest is taken up with an explanation of astronomical assumptions and\nmathematical methods; the length of the year and the motion of the Sun; the length of the\nmonth and the motions of the Moon; the sizes and distances of the Sun, the Moon, and Earth\nitself; eclipses of the Sun and the Moon; and the precession of the equinoxes.\n\n% Surya Siddhanta V:24.\n\n\u00b0 W.

                "content": "from material culled from Chaldean, Egyptian, Greek, and earlier writings, with which we\nshall also not concer ourselves here. Let not the reader, however, disqualify Ptolemy as an\nincompetent astronomer because of his astrological beliefs. Isaac Newton was not only a be-\nliever in alchemy, he himself attempted to change base metals into silver and gold.'\u00ae\n\nAs Heuer informed his readers, \u201cPtolemy was not the kind of genius who produced new\nideas; he took existing ideas and changed and extended them in order to obtain agreement\nwith observed facts.\u201d\"* There is no doubt, however, that a large part of the theories he\npresents are his own contributions \u201cbased on observations of his own, not to speak of the\nunbelievable number of numerical calculations which underlie the tables of the Almagest.\u201d\"*\n\nSome of Ptolemy\u2019s modern defenders have been claiming that his \u201csystem\u201d has been\nmuch misunderstood by astronomers as well as historians of astronomy. As Irving Wolfe\npointed out:\n\n\u201c,..the theory of Ptolemy was not presented in its time as a real picture of the sky.\nAstrophysicist Bruce Gregory reminds us that Ptolemy\u2019s model was not said to be a\nminiature of the Solar System, as we use the word today. It was \u2018a device for\ncalculating the position of the planets, not a device for representing the appearance of\nthe planets.\u201d Astonishingly, the theory of Copernicus was first presented in the\nsame way, as a system which \u2018might not be the true scheme of nature, but merely a\nmathematical fiction which fitted the observations.\u201d Ptolemy\u2019s system, however,\nwas soon elevated to absolute truth, as was Copernicus\u2019 later, so it is we who have\nmade them into religions.\u201d '*\n\nMaybe so, even though, to me, this sounds more like an attempt to whitewash Ptolemy\u2019s\nimage. Thus, for instance, those astronomers who have more recently re-examined Ptolemy\u2019s\noriginal data soon realized that retrocalculations of the planets proved that many of\nPtolemy\u2019s so-called observations were wrong. \u201cThe errors were gross even by the standards\nof ancient astronomy.\u201d There is also no longer any doubt that Ptolemy plagiarized the\nwork of the earlier Hipparchus. We have already noted the earlier star catalogue compiled by\nHipparchus who conducted his observations from the island of Rhodes. This Greek island\nlies five degrees of latitude north of Alexandria. This makes for a five-degree band of\nsouthern stars that can be seen from Alexandria but not from Rhodes. Not a single one of the\n1,022 stars that Ptolemy listed in his catalogue is to be found in this five-degree band.\nMoreover, \u201cevery example given in the Almagest of how to work out spherical astronomy\nproblems is given for a latitude the same as that of Rhodes.\u201d!\u201d\u00b0\n\nRobert Newton went even further:\n\n\u201891.
