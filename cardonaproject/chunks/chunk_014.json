Sachs.)\n\nnomena recorded in them] are precisely those that are predicted by the mathematical astro-\nnomical cuneiform texts of the Hellenistic [that is later Greek] period.\u201d \u00ae\n\nDuring Seleucid times, when Babylon was ruled by the Hellenistic dynasty founded by\nSeleucus I after the death of Alexander, a period which is calculated to have lasted from 312\nto 64 B.C., lunar and planetary theory had developed along Greek classical lines. Abstract\nnumerical tables, or ephemerides, representing the motions of the heavenly bodies, were\nmuch in vogue at the time. These continued to record the recurrence of astronomical phe-\nnomena, year by year, \u201cwith an accuracy comparable with that of contemporary observa-\ntions.\u201d Judging by the contents of the astronomical diaries, this accuracy can be stretched\nto 747 B.C.\n\nThere is no great wonder in all of this, but it does prove one point, banal as it may seem,\nand that is this: Beginning from af least the middle of the seventh century B.C., Babylonian\nastronomers knew very well what these pin-points of light called planets looked like and\ncould easily distinguish one from the other; they knew where every planet belonged in the\nsky and what track each one of them invariably followed\u2014an easy matter for anyone with a\nkeen eye-sight plus the patience and the motivation to learn. Yes, I know, it is hardly even\nworth mentioning.\n\nWhy, then, contrary to what we see above us in the night sky at present, did these same\nBabylonian astronomers insist that the planet we call Saturn had been the most prominent\nbody in the sky?\n\nThat is a question the answer to which, beginning in the very next chapter of this work,\nwill carry us into some very strange and deep waters.\n\n6 Ibid, p. 44.\n'7 A.

Saturn]...is the most conspicuous...\u201d\n\nAs viewed from Earth, this is simply not so. Venus is much more prominent. It is easily\nthe brightest of the planets, bright enough at night to cast shadows and, when meteorological\nconditions permit, bright enough to be seen during the day. In contradistinction, Saturn is a\nvery difficult object to observe. Even Bob Forrest, one of the strongest opponents of cosmic\ncatastrophism, was moved to display his bewilderment at this datum:\n\n\u201cThe only puzzling thing about this passage [of Diodorus] is the way Saturn is said to\nbe the most conspicuous of the planets. All else is fairly routine.\u201d\n\nAs we shall see, this statement is not the \u201conly puzzling thing\u201d in this passage of\nDiodorus; nor is all else in it \u201cfairly routine.\u201d But one thing at a time.\n\nThe term \u201cChaldean,\u201d meanwhile, has long been misunderstood and misapplied by an-\ncient historians and moderns alike. As used by Diodorus and other classical authors, the term\nsimply meant \u201castrologers\u201d and/or \u201castronomers,\u201d but always in relation to the Babylonians.*\nThese, then, were the same Babylonians whose astronomical achievements we have enumer-\nated in the previous section. But how, then, with all of their sophisticated knowledge of the\nheavens, could they have committed such an error. Or, if an error it was not, why would they\nhave perpetuated such a falsity?\n\nOf course, one could also ask: Why take the word of Diodorus, a Greek historian, who\ncould easily have been mistaken on matters Babylonian? But was Diodorus the only writer of\nantiquity who ever reported this strange belief concerning the planet Saturn? And, in fact,\nwere the Babylonians the only ones who were supposed to have asserted this oddity?\n\nTo give but one other example\u2014and later we shall give others\u2014we note here one of the\nSanskrit names of the planet Saturn, that is Grahanayakah.* The name is composed of the\n\n' Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, 11:30-34.\n\n2B, Forrest, Velikovsky's Sources:, p. 532.\n3 J, D, Prince, \u201cChaldea,\u201d, Vol. 5, p. 195.\n\n*V.S.

Odder still is that he relegated it to\nthe unimportance of \u201cfairly routine\u201d reporting because, to the Greeks of Diodorus\u2019 time, Hel-\nios was the Sun.

With so\nmany cuneiform tablets having been fost through the vagaries of nature and the hand of man,\nand with so many undeciphered others falling apart in museum basements, it would not have\nbeen remarkable had this datum not survived in the original.

Eratosthenes of Alexandria, who thrived somewhere between 276\nand 194 B.C., and whose astronomical, mathematical, and geographical knowledge enabled\nhim, as we have already seen, to measure Earth\u2019s circumference, identified the planet Saturn\nas the star of the Sun, as so did several other Greek writers.''

                "content": "Simplicius who also called Saturn the star of the Sun.\n\nWhether they obtained this particular information from the Greeks or not, we find that the\nRomans were of a similar mind. In his enumeration of the planets, the Latin writer Gaius\nIulius Hyginus who, as the superintendent of the Palatine Library, must have had access to\nmuch older material, referred to the planet in question as the star of Sol. As just about any\ndictionary will verify, Sol was not only the Roman Sun personified, it was, as it still is, the\nvery Latin word for \u201cSun.\u201d From it are derived such English words as \u201csolar,\u201d \u201csolarium,\u201d\nand \u201csolstice.\u201d The scholiast on Germanicus also lists Saturn as Stella Solis\u2019*\u2014Star of the\nSun\u2014a name which apparently was a common designation for the planet in Roman times.\u2019\n\nBut whence the belief? Better still, what does the designation \u201cstar of the Sun\u201d really\nmean? To what does it allude?\n\nA telling clue comes from Sanskrit. In this language, Surya is the common name for the\nSun. Suryaputrah, which means \u201cson of the Sun,\u201d is however one of the names for the planet\nSaturn.\u201d Another Sanskrit name for the Sun is Ravi and, again, we find the planet Saturn\ndesignated as Raviputra which also means \u201cson of the Sun.\u201d\u201d As the son of the Sun, Saturn\ncould be termed the star of the Sun. But this only raises another question. Why would Saturn,\namong the planets, have been thought of as the son of the Sun?\n\nLet us go one step farther. Yet another Sanskrit name for the planet Saturn is Saurah. But\nsaurah also means \u201csolar day\u201d and/or \u201csolar month.\u201d This seems to indicate that the con-\nnection between Saturn and the Sun was more intimate than we have so far deduced. In fact,\nthis last datum is enough to make one believe that, at least to the Hindus, Saturn and the Sun\nwere close to being synonymous.\n\n(MUL) LU-BAT SAG-US\n\nA common entry in a collection of astrological reports from Nineveh and Babylon which,\nin variant forms, is many times repeated, uses the formula \u201cWhen Shamash [the same as\n\nSamai] stands in the halo of Sin\u201d such and such a thing will come to pass.\u201d Now open up\njust about any work on Assyro-Babylonian mythology and you will find it stated that\nShamash and Sin were the deified Sun and Moon. According to this belief, the omen men-\ntioned above would then translate as \u201cwhen the Sun stands in the halo of the Moon\u201d such and\nsuch a thing will come to pass.\n\nNow while Sun and Moon can be seen together, the Sun can never appear in the halo of\nthe Moon. For one thing, the Sun does not appear small enough to fit between the Moon and\nits surrounding halo\u2014when it has one; for another, the Moon can only appear within a halo\nduring the night when the Sun, needless to say, is absent. What, then, could the Babylonian\nastrologers have been alluding to?\n\n\u201d Ibid.\n\n, [1:42:6-10.\n\n\u2122 There are even some indications that the words \u201csol\u201d and \u201csun\u201d might be philotogically related.

                "content": "like those of ancient China, were required to acquaint their rulers with the mandates of\nheaven, to warn them of impending disasters or to soothe their fears with reports of divine\nsatisfaction. The foretold events might not always have come to pass. Fallacious predictions,\nhowever, were one thing; impossible ones were quite another. There would have been no\npoint in predicting an event based on an astronomical occurrence that could never have come\nto pass. A prognostication based on the appearance of the Sun within the halo of the Moon\nwould not only have been useless, it would have been considered utterly insane. No Babylon-\nian astrologer would have risked ridicule, not to mention royal displeasure, by sending such a\nprediction to his king. Why, then, did they even bother writing down such a formula?\n\nAs Morris Jastrow, even without knowing the full implication of these formulae, con-\n\ncluded: \u201cSince this phenomenon can only occur at night, Sama\u00a7 cannot of course be the\nsun.\u201d\nThis brings us back to the Babylonian statement mentioned earlier which reads \u201c(Mul)\n\nLu-Bat Sag-U8 Sama& Su-u,\u201d and which, as we have seen, Thompson translated as\n\u201cSaturn is the star of the sun.\u201d Jastrow, however, has noted that while this reading is possible,\na more accurate translation would be \u201cSaturn is the sun-star.\u201d\u201d We note here the difference\nbetween calling Saturn the star of the Sun\u2014the star belonging to the Sun\u2014and naming it as\nthe Sun-star since the latter seems to connote the Sun itself. In fact, another translation given\nby Jastrow is \u201c{the] star is Shamash.\u201d Stated more clearly, what this\ndatum is reaily telling us is that \u201cthe planet Saturn is Shamash\u201d\u2122 or \u201cShamash is the planet\nSaturn.\u201d\n\nWhat is also of interest is that this statement appears as a gloss in one of those omens\nwhich uses the formula \u201cwhen Shamash stands in the halo of Sin.\u201d* This, then, was the as-\ntrologers\u2019 way of informing whoever read this particular report that by Shamash the planet\nSaturn, and not the Sun, was meant. The formula in question should therefore read \u201cwhen\nSaturn stands in the halo of Sin\u201d such and such a thing will come to pass.\n\nThis is further clarified by another gloss which appears in a number of similar cases\n\n Lu-Bat Sag-U8S ina tarbas Sin izzaz\u201d \u2014i.e. \u201cSaturn\nstands in the halo of Sin.\u201d* This not only makes better observational sense, it\ncompliments\u2014nay, validates\u2014the formula which uses Shamash as a name for Satur. if\nconditions permit, the pin-point of light in the night sky that is Satum can be discemed\nwithin the halo of the Moon. (Actually, this argument, which I myself have had reason to\nrepeat in the past,\u201d is not even called for because, as I will indicate in a future work, Sin did\nnot always stand for the Moon.\u201d)\n\nThompson, of course, was aware before Jastrow that the Babylonians called Saturn by the\nname of Shamash.\u201d Since this verity came to light at least as early as 1900, it is a sin of\nomission\u2014worse still, a scholarly deception\u2014not to have it so stated in current works deal-\ning with Assyro-Babylonian mythology.

Among the Aramaeans\n\n.* In pre-Islamic times, the\n\nArabic word was Sam&.* Even in Maltese, the only European language with a\ndistinctive Semitic root-base, the Sun is called xemx,\u201d where the \u201cx\u201d is phonetically equiva-\nlent to \u201csh\u201d \u2014thus shemsh.\n\nAll of this raises some very interesting questions, Why, for instance, was the planet Sat-\num called by the same name as the Sun? It is not as if the Babylonians had no other names\n\nfor Saturn\u2014we have already encountered two: En-Me Sar- Lu-Bat Sag-US. But\nalso, ancient names, unlike some modern ones, carried their own meanings. No one in those\ndays would have thought of naming a person or an object by using lexical abstraction.\nShemesh, and therefore Shamash, means \u201cto be brilliant,\u2019 and while this may be an apt\nname for the Sun, one would hardly think of alluding to the pin-point of light that is Saturn\nby the same appellation. And yet this is precisely what the Babylonians did. As Jastrow was\nforced to conclude, \u201cthe fact that Saturn was also called the \u2018sun\u2019 is vouched for, both by ex-\nplanatory notes attached to astrological connotations, and by notices in classical writings to\nthat effect.\u201d\u201d Thus, while we understand that Shamash was the name of the planet Saturn as\nwell as the Sun, is it also to be understood that Saturn was once believed to have been as\nbrilliant as the Sun?",

When a reason is given, it usually runs some-\nthing like the following: Nimrod, sometimes called Nebrod, the traditional founder of Baby-\nlon, was \u201cthe first to become king on earth...and took as title the name of the planet Kronos\n{which was Saturn].\u201d* Nimrod, however, did not have to take the name of the planet Saturn\nbecause his name was already that of Saturn. Thus, for instance, Nimrod has also, and often,\nbeen claimed to be an alias of Ninurta.\u201d The actual truth, however, is that the two names are\nreally one and the same. The cuneiform characters which spell nin, ur, and ta can also be\nread nim, ru, and ud respectively\u201d \u2014which can be said to be the same syllables in reverse\nand which, of course, spell \u201cnimru-ud,\u201d a name that has been popularized as \u201cNimrod.\u201d*\n\nOf course, it is not only in legendary taies, such as those dealing with Nimrod, that Saturn\nwas lauded as king\u2014often the very first king the world had ever known. As we have already\nseen above, in the original, that is older, sources, Ninurta/Saturn is himself proclaimed\nugal\u2014that is \u201cking.\u201d And this, again, is in keeping with the mytho-historical record since all\nof the Saturnian deities were revered as kings, the first of their line.\n\nFormerly, when the decipherment of cuneiform was still in its infancy and the translitera-\ntion of the Mesopotamian deities had not yet been formalized, the name Ninurta was vari-\nously read as Ninib, Ninip, or simply Nin, a title which has been translated as meaning\n\u201cLord,\u201d although it also stands for \u201cLady.\u201d\u201d (And is it because of this that Fred Bratton\nlisted Ninurta as a fertility goddess,\u201d or was this merely a typographical error?) Thus,\nscholars of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were wont to refer to this astral\ndeity by one, or more, of the above names. Writing in 1885, George Rawlinson opted for Nin\n\n* Or, according to a slightly different translation, \u201cKing, Storm, whose splendor is Heroic\u201d\u2014see ibid.\n\n4S M.

However, the same cuneiform sign also stood for \u201cking.\u201d* But, more\nthan that, the very same ideogram was also used to \u201cspell\u201d the name of the great Sumerian\n\u201d who-~as the father of all the gods, the \u201cHead of the older generation of\ngods,\u201d standing at the beginning of every theological list from all periods*\u2014can also be\nunderstood as a personification of the Saturnian deity.\n\nMore in keeping with our subject, we also find Ninib lauded as \u201cthe light of heaven and\nearth\u201d and, quite explicitly, as \u201che who, like the sun, the light of the gods, irradiates the na-\ntions.\u201d\n\nThere is, again, no point in claiming that these were metaphorical epithets meant to be\napplied to the god and not the planet he represented because, to the ancients who venerated\nhim, the god and the planet was one and the same. And this, incidentally, is not merely my\ncontention. Conventional mythologists had recognized this fact for themselves even though\nthey found it very difficult to accept. Thus Peter Jensen was forced to see in Saturn an an-\ncient symbol of the \u201ceastern sun\u201d or \u201cthe sun on the horizon,\u201d without however offering a\nsingle piece of evidence for this interpretation. George Rawlinson himself found these epi-\nthets \u201cvery difficult to reconcile with the notion that, as a celestial luminary, [Ninip] was Sat-\num.\u201d*' Somewhat like Jensen, he, also, sought to explain the situation by appealing to astral\nbodies other than the one indicated by the texts themselves, As he wrote: \u201cThese phrases ap-\npear to point to the Moon, or to some very brilliant star, and are scarcely reconcilable with\nthe notion that [Ninip] was the dark and distant Saturn.\u201d@\n\nElsewhere, and earlier, Rawlinson had indicated the same bewilderment when he asked:\n\u201cHow is it possible that the dark and distant planet Saturn can answer to the luminary who\n[or which] \u2018irradiates the nations like the sun, the light of the gods\u2019?\u201d*",
