                "content": "Kronos\u2019s association with time that his name was given to the most distant of the seven\nheavenly bodies...because it concludes its orbit in 30 years, so that a day in its year corre-\nsponds to a month in the earth\u2019s year.\u201d\n\nSaturn\u2019s slow motion along its orbit, however, does not explain why the planet was also\nchosen to represent the year. If any celestial body can presently claim the right to represent\nthe year, it surely would have to be the Sun. As an indicator of the passage of time, it remains\nsupreme. Even the Moon would have been a better indicator with which to gauge the pro-\ngress of time. Moreover, our ancient forebears, living in this primeval era, would hardly have\neven noticed the planet Saturn if it then appeared, like now, as nothing but a pin-point of\nlight in the night sky. More importantly, Dupuis\u2019, or Schlegel\u2019s, as also Stecchini\u2019s, exposi-\ntions do not explain what Saturn, even as Time personified, had to do with Creation. Besides,\nwhy would the slowness of the planet Saturn have led ancient man to believe in an era when\ntime was not?\n\nAs we have indicated in earlier pages, and as we shall show more fully in a sequel vol-\nume, it was the Saturnian deity who was held responsible for the Creation. But, in an Iranian\nRivayat, this role is bestowed on Time. \u201cTime is both Creator and the Lord of Creation which\nit created,\u201d it is there stated.\u201d This is paralleled by the Atharva Veda which states that \u201cTime\ncreated the earth...\u201d A curious passage concerning Creation in a Hindu Brahmana brings\nvarious elements together:\n\n\u201cThen the seed [of Creation] became a year. Before that time there was no year.\u201d\n\nThus, despite the fact that the waters of chaos were said to have been born of Time, as we\nhave seen above, the reverse was just as true. As it was said, the waters of chaos themselves\nproduced the year, \u201cthe ordainer of the days and nights.\u201d\u201d We also have it from the Maitri\nUpanishad that \u201cthe year, verily, is Prajapati [that is Saturn, who] is Time.\u201d\n\nWhat all this intimates is that what Hindu sources term as \u201cthe year\u201d is a synonym for\n\u201ctime.\u201d, which is normally\ntaken to mean \u201cday,\u201d has the additional meaning of \u201cyear\u201d but also \u201ctime.\u201d So, similarly, in\nEgypt. The word thera, which means \u201cyear,\u201d also means \u201ctime.\u201d Thus Ptah, whom we have\nalready seen identified as Saturn, was called \u201cthe Lord of the Year,\u201d whereas Atum, his al-\nter-ego, was called \u201cthe Lord of Time.\u201d* The two epithets are synonymous.\n\n3\u00b0.\n\n*'\u00a7.

                "content": "In an our first chapter we saw Dionysus as the original impetus behind Greek drama. But\nwho was this god?\n\nThe mythology of Dionysus presents him as a rambunctious conqueror who spread ter-\n world. Wherever he went, he introduced the grape\nvine and, with it, the fermentation of wine. In this respect he was similar to the Egyptian\nOsiris/ world, bringing civilization to the countries he\nvisited, as so did other Saturnian deities.\n\n already knew that the Greek Dionysus was the\nequivalent of the Egyptian Osiris. He knew about this equation from Plutarch (c. 46-120 A.\nD.)\u201d and the even earlier Herodotus who lived in the 5th century B.C.* The similarity be-\ntween Dionysus and Osiris, moreover, did not merely concern their histories as civilizers, but\neven their rites. This was so much so that Herodotus was driven to claim that the rites of Di-\nonysus could only have been borrowed by the Greeks from the Egyptians.\u201d These similari-\nties, however, are not restricted to Dionysus and Osiris, but are common to various other\nSaturnian deities. (There is also some indication that, in some quarters, Dionysus was identi-\nfied as an alter-ego of Helios\u201d who, as we have already seen, was the original Greek name of\nthe planet Saturn.)\n\nThe association of time with Saturn explains why the much later festivals of the New\nYear, touched upon briefly in preceding pages, were devoted to Saturn in his many guises.\nWe should therefore not be surprised to find that among these festivals were those held in\nhonor of Dionysus, who is not only identifiable as the Saturnalian king,\u201d but also directly as\nthe Saturnian deity.\u201d it was not, therefore, spurious of William Heidel to note the obvious\nconnection of Dionysus with Aion.\u201d As Marija Gimbutas informed her readers: \u201cIn these\nfestivals, which have assimilated elements of deep antiquity, Dionysus appears as a year-\ngod.\u201d\u00b0",

                "content": "one should not castigate Immanuel Velikovsky who, on the testimony of Eduard Seler,\nadhered to this identification,\u00ae as so have many of his followers.) Jill Abery, on the other\nhand, was not quite happy with this identification or with any of the others mentioned\nabove\u2014and rightly so. As she opined:\n\n\u201cQuetzalcoatl is a very ancient god with a multiple of aspects. As the feathered ser-\npent, readers of Velikovsky will have no difficulty in identifying him as Venus in\ncometary garb. But beyond this he is the Lord of healing, learning, beauty, creativity\nand vegetation. He was a benefactor who brought to men the use of metals and the\narts of government; who ruled in an age of perfumed, melodious plenty which can be\nregarded as the Golden Age of Mesoamerica...It would [therefore] appear that Quet-\nzalcoatl was originally the Mesoamerican equivalent of Osiris or Saturn.\u201d\u00ae\n\nWould that mainstream mythologists had been as astute. Abery, of course, was not the\nfirst to ferret out the true identity of Quetzalcoatl,\u201d but I mention her especially because her\nintuition exemplifies what can be gleaned by a mind which is not constrained by orthodox\nviews.\n\nWhat has confused the issue, and many a mythologist, is the Mesoamerican belief that\nwhen Quetzalcoatl died, his heart flew up and turned into the Morning Star,\u00ae which star has\nbeen usually understood as Venus when it appears in the morning\u201d \u2014an event that, as we\nhave seen on an earlier page, is duplicated in the mythology of the Egyptian Osiris/Saturn.\nWhat mythologists and archaeoastronomers seem to forget is that it was the heart of\nQuetzalcoatl, and not Quetzalcoatl himself, which turned into the Morning Star. Quetzalcoatl\nand the Morning Star were thus two entirely different entities.\n\nLet me now state that nowhere in Mesoamerican lore is Quetzalcoatl identified as Saturn.\nIf this identification is to hold, it must do so on the evidence offered by comparative\nmythology.\n\nLike the Saturnian deity of other nations, Quetzalcoatl was considered as the creator.\u201d\nLike the Saturnian deity of other nations, as Abery indicated, Quetzalcoatl was also a\ncivilizer.\u201d As in the Saturnian myths of other nations, Quetzalcoatl was the original one and\nonly god.
