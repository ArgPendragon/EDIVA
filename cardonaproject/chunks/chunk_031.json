We see it at the midocean ridges, and there\nare some hot springs. But this is an almost unique opportunity to study a com-\nplex ecosystem in a readily available site-- where there\u2019s no light coming in\nand yet we have a complex menagerie of organisms.\u201d\u00ae\n\nActually, the propensity of varied organisms that live entombed within Earth\u2019s cav-\nems has been known and studied for far longer than Hose inadvertently intimates. Blind cave\nfish have been known since 1938;7\u2019 cave-dwelling salamanders since 1689. Not only do\nsuch creatures live in total darkness, light itself becomes a hazard\u2014-as proven by eye-less\nmitlipedes which curl up in frantic efforts to avoid artificially introduced beams of light.\u201d As\nDonald Jackson could already write in 1982:\n\n\u201cBeneath the shroud of eternal darkness [that exists \u2018deep within the under-\nworld\u2019], no green plants\u2014the basis of the food chain for most creatures \u2014can\ngrow. The environment could hardly seem less hospitable to life. And yet,\nastonishingly, animals can thrive in the caverns of the earth. Unseen, unheard,\nthey creep and crawl, slither and scuttle, swim and fly, endlessly questing for\nthe means of survival. In their marvelous physical adaptations, in the senses\nthey use to navigate the perpetual night of a rockbound realm, in their extraor-\ndinary behavior and reproductive patterns, they offer a microscopic study of\nevolution.\u201d\n\nNone of these creatures of darkness are mammals, the class of animals to which man\nbelongs. But consider the bat, many species of which spend their daylight hours hanging to-\ngether upside down in the recesses of darkened caves. When they venture outside, it is at\nnight\u2014from total darkness to a lesser gloom. Their sonic ability allows them to navigate the\ncaliginous corridors, often sinuous, as well as they do outside at night. Had they been blind,\nthey would have been able to maneuver just as well. For all they require, the world outside\ncould just as well be totally dark. They would survive.\n\nWithout relying on their sonic abilities, which they do not possess, various mammals,\nas well as some birds, have adapted so well to thriving at night that we now class them as\n\n35 Anonymous, \u201cCave Creatures,\u201d, pp. 18, 20.\n% Ibid., p. 20.\n7, p. 119 ff.\n\n289",

And yet, the\nchemistry of photosynthesis is identical in all these plants. What actually transpires is that\nphotosynthesis proceeds at a rate that is directly proportional to the incident radiation in\nwhich the light energy is utilized with the greatest efficiency. Moreover, it has been caleu-\nlated that only about one to three percent of the light falling on any plant is actually trans-\nformed into chemical energy. Most of the Sun\u2019s radiation falling on a piant is lost through\nreflection and ineffective absorption by pigments other than chlorophyl! (or, at least, other\nthan those pigments in the chloroplasts).\n\nHow does all this affect our progressing theoretical construct?\n\nWell, for one thing, Sunlight being starlight, photosynthesis would have been able to\noccur just as well under the light shed by the brown dwarf star that once was Saturn. Its\ndimmer light would have been compensated for by the plants\u2019 ability to control absorption in\nproportion to the incident radiation falling upon them.\n\nEqually significant to our study is the fact that red light is the most important spec-\ntrum necessary for the growing of plants.\" Brown dwarf stars are known to radiate a propen-\nsity of red light. Thus, the spectrum of received light on Earth during the Saturnian period\nwould have been much redder than at present\u201d and, therefore, more conducive to plant\ngrowth.\n\nThe brown dwarf star that was Saturn would have also radiated ultraviolet light.\u201d But\nthen so does the Sun. Ultraviolet rays are normally considered relatively harmless and even\nbeneficial. Long-term exposure to high concentrations of these rays can, however, also prove\nharmful. We have no way of knowing how highly concentrated the ultraviolet rays from Sat-\nurn would have been. Since, even at its best, the Saturnian sun was feebler than the Sun, it is\nquite possible that its ultraviolet radiation would also have been feebler. During the age of\nsemi-darkness with which we are presently concerned, when Saturn had not yet flared up as a\ntrue sun, its entire radiation might have been feebier still. In the meantime, it has been found\nthat mosses in the Antarctic region are able to produce certain compounds which act to pro-\ntect them against excessive ultraviolet radiation.\u201d Who is to say that other plants might not\nhave derived the same ability during the Saturnian era of semi-darkness had our brown dwarf\nprimary radiated excessive ultraviolet rays?",

Robert Wharton, a biologist at the Desert Research Institute in Reno,\nhas found life at the bottom of perpetually frozen lakes in an area of wind-\nswept, snowless valleys.\u201d**\n\nLake Hoare, situated in a mountainous region 800 miles from the South Pole, is cov-\nered by a 20-foot thick sheet of ice, the mean surface temperature of which reaches 4 below\nzero. And yet, colorful algae-like organisms manage to survive underneath the lake\u2019s icy\ncrust. As Wharton himself declared:\n\n\u201cfThese algae-like organisms are] a fairly advanced form of life. You\u2019ve got a\ncell wall, and you\u2019ve got DNA inside the cell that is able to reproduce and\npass on information to its offspring. it\u2019s not elephants, but it\u2019s a big step in the\nevolution of biology.\u201d*\u00b0\n\nOr, as Chris McKay succinctly phrased it, even in permanent subfreezing conditions,\n\u201clife can persist much longer than we\u2019d thought.\u201d\u201d\u201d\n\nTrue, as Wharton admitted, these algae-like organisms are not elephants\u2014and a far\ncry from land plants and animals, to say nothing about humans. But, as in the case of those\ncreatures that are able to exist in total darkness, the above serves to illustrate that generalities\ncan often be deceiving.\n\nAn adaptation to cold is not called for in the primeval Saturnian environment we are\nattempting to reconstruct. As we have already seen in Chapter 5, even at present, Saturn radi-\nates more heat than it receives from the Sun. We saw there that, while Jupiter\u2019s excessive\nheat is accepted as a residue from the planet\u2019s formative period, most of Saturn\u2019s had been\nrelegated to kinetic energy released by the circulation of dissolved helium. But when Voy-\nager 1 flew past Saturn in late 1980, it failed to uncover such evidence. As reported by\nDennis Overbye:\n\n\u201cPioneer 11 had found that Saturn radiates almost three times as much energy\nas it receives from the sun. Some scientists had suggested that the helium\nmight be settling deeper inside Saturn\u2019s atmosphere than the hydrogen, re-\nleasing gravitational energy in the form of \u2018helium rain.\u2019 But this would leave\nSaturn\u2019s outer layers relatively deficient in helium, and Voyager found that\nthis was not the case.\u201d**\n\n35M.

While this work has\nnothing to say for or against this proposition, some of Lovelock\u2019s insights are germane to our\nsubject.\n\n\u201cFor example, [according to orthodoxy] we know that when the solar system\nwas formed the sun was dim and that it has heated up ever since. Yet Earth\nwasn\u2019t too cold for life in the beginning, and it isn\u2019t too hot for life now.\u201d\n\nWhile Lovelock gives his own reasons for this, the belief that the Sun was much\nweaker in Earth\u2019s dim past has now gained acceptance. In analyzing the problems of climate\nthought to be inherent during the Archaean era\u20143.8 to 2.5 billion years ago\u2014Gregory Jen-\nkins speaks of an environment that \u201cwas very warm with a sun that is much cooler than to-\nday\u2019s.\u201d\u201c' Geological evidence indicates that this trend continued into the early Precambrian\nperiod during which \u201cEarth was much warmer...than it is today, despite a weaker sun,.\u201d\u201d\n\nBillions and millions of years are far removed from the Saturnian era with which we\nare concerned. The point ] wish to stress, however, is that even as per orthodox belief, life on\nEarth does not seem to have required abundant heat from the Sun. We notice, for instance,\nthat the reconstructions of primeval plants by paleobotanists, who are guided in their recon-\nstructions by fossils found in coal and other deposits, end up showing some rather tall speci-\nmens exhibiting sparse crowns of foliage. Such a study, for instance, was recently conducted\non specimens recovered from the coal seams of the American Midwest and Ohio Valley,\nwhich are believed to have been laid down by vast swamps which once stretched from Mis-\nsouri to Pennsylvania. The lycopods, forty-five to ninety feet tall,* that were reconstructed\nfrom these remains have all the appearance of trees which seem to be straining their trunks in\norder to reach a feeble light, just as some plants do when grown in a dimly-lit terrarium that\nis kept in a darkened room.\u201d Thus, for instance, when the succulent popularly known as\nhens-and-chickens, which usually grows relatively flat to the ground, is grown in such a ter-\nrarium, it tends to stretch tall and spindly with its fleshy leaves growing in an open and loose\nspiral until it either reaches the light or bends and breaks under its own weight.\u201d\n\nAs paleobotanists from the University of Illinois who studied the remains of lycopods\nascertained: \u201cPlant life was quite different then; most plants had no seeds, and flowers had\nnot yet made their appearance.\u201d\u201d True, these trees are supposed to have thrived three\n\n% Ibid., p. 21.\n\n* \u00a9, Morton, \u201cIs the Earth Alive?\u201d, p. 98.\n\n\u201c' G.

At its simplest, to quote Wallace Thornhill, it \u201cis an ionized gas in which the\natoms or molecules have been stripped of their electrons, allowing both positive and negative\ncharges to move independently.\u201d There are those who deny that plasma is itself a gas, call-\ning it instead a fourth state of matter which often behaves like a gas, but which conducts\nelectricity and is affected by magnetic fields.\n\nThere was a time, not so long ago, when astrophysicists had close to no use for electric-\nity, let alone plasmas, in astronomy. But by 1999, Dennis Gallagher, a plasma physicist at",

And yet, according\nto Thornhill, one characteristic of plasmas is that they tend to shield bodies embedded in\nthem by creating what is known as a Langmuir sheath around them.\n\nBy 1997, even Talbott had jumped on this band-wagon, opting for a more extensive and\nencasing atmospheric shroud around the Saturnian system we have been reconstructing.
