                "content": "like to reserve that for a later part of this work. But it would do no harm here to note that in\nanalysing the Mayan holy book known as the Popul Vuh, which, among other things, deals\nwith the glowing face of the sun, it comes out unreservedly that certainly it was not the same\nsun which we see.\u201d\n\nWould it then be too much to consider what appears to be the only other alternative\u2014that\nwhat the ancients believed was indeed what they, or their ancestors, had actually seen and\nexperienced?\n\nBefore we answer that question, let us consider one additional point. The ancients did not\nmerely maintain that Saturn was, or had been, a sun. They alluded to it as such as if it was, or\nonce had been, general knowledge; as if everyone knew that this was, or had been, the case.\nNo explanations, clarifications, or qualified rationalizations are ever encountered to account\nfor the phenomenon. But, whether speaking of the Saturnian god as distinct from his lumin-\nary or of the luminary that was Saturn itself, it was always accepted that deity and planet,\nwhich in reality were one, coruscated, or had once coruscated, as a true sun. Personally, this\nwas one aspect concerning the Saturnian phenomenon which further convinced me that not\nonly did the ancients mean exactly what they \u201csaid,\u201d but that they probably knew what they\nwere \u201ctalking\u201d about. But what, exactly, did this amount to?\n\nAt this point we had best lay the cards we have so far accumulated plainly on the table.\nWe have, I believe, supplied ample evidence (and more will be forthcoming in the chapters\nthat follow) to indicate that the ancients believed Saturn to have once radiated as a sun. As\nHodder Westropp and Staniland Wake had concluded long before Jastrow on studying an-\ncient symbolism, as far as the ancients were concerned, Saturn was the /irst irradiator of\nlight.\" But a question we posed earlier remains unanswered. This concerns the sharing of\nnames between Saturn and the Sun. But then, what is ttue\u2014that Saturn was given the former\nname of the Sun, or that the Sun was given the former name of Saturn?\n\nBoll seems to have had no doubts about this. As far as he was concerned, the Greek Hel-\nios and the Latin Sol were originally the names of the planet Saturn.\u201d Here I would like to\nmention the cult of Sol Invictus, the Unconquered Sun, which did not gain significant ascen-\ndancy until the third century A. D. Both the cult and the festivals associated with it were es-\n\nand celebrated on the 25th of December\u2014what to the Western World today i is Christmas.\nAs Roger Wescott asked, why would the Sun have been deemed unconquered. \u201cThe common\nassumption about this theonymic phrase,\u201d wrote Wescott, \u201cis that it could be loosely equated\nwith \u2018the invincible sun\u2019.\u201d\u2122 Wescott, however, was \u201cinclined\u201d to take the term literally. In\nwhich case the question could be asked: Was there also a cult of Sol Victus\u2014\u201cthe conquered\nSun\u201d? As Wescott concluded: \u201cAlthough this latter phrase [i.e. Sol Victus] does not occur in\nRoman literature, the phrase Sol Indigetes is found, referring to an older sun-god. vt\n\nit can therefore be conjectured that in each case where Saturn and the Sun share the same\nname, the name originally belonged to Saturn. This suspicion moves closer to certainty when\nwe realize that, while every major ancient name of the Sun was also bestowed on Saturn, not\nevery ancient name of the planet Saturn was bestowed on the Sun. The certainty grows when,\n\n\"1. Goetz &, p. 188.\n\n\"8H. Westropp & C. S. Stanitand, Ancient Symbol Worship: Influence of the Phallic Idea in the Religions of\n, p. 64.\n\n\u2122 F.

The best that Wallis Budge could offer by way\nof an explanation was that Atum,, whom he referred to by the name\u2019s former reading of\nTemu, was the Sun after it had set. ? By this he meant to imply that the Egyptians worshipped\nthe Sun even when it was absent from the sky. Sun worship at night, however, makes for an\nincongruous institution. This fallacious interpretation should never have been derived, and it\nwould not have, had the Egyptologists thought of comparing their texts more diligently with\nthose in the hands of the Assyriologists.\n\nThere has never been any doubt that, as far as the Egyptians themselves were concerned,\nAtum \u201cwas held to be one of the forms of the great Sun-god Ra.. .\u201d3 For the time being, we\nshall not bother ourselves with Budge\u2019s contention that Atum was the personification of the\nsetting Sun,* especially since, elsewhere, Atum is described as rising. \u00b0 As we shall see, both\nthese terms\u2014i.e. \u201crising\u201d and \u201c \u2018setting\u201d \u2014are based on mistranslations which will be clarified\nlater on. Budge was also of the opinion that Atum \u201cwas originally the local god of the city of\nAnnu, or Heliopolis,\u201d\u00ae and that only later was he assimilated with Ra. While this seems to\nhave really been the case, it must not be assumed that the assimilation was an arbitrary one.\nThis assimilation resulted in the double god known as Atum-\u2019 as indicated\nin the hymn contained in the Papyrus of Mut-hetep\u00ae and elsewhere.\n\nHere, perhaps, we could add that Ra was also worshipped by the same name in\nMesopotamia, although his Semitic equivalent, El, was more popular.\u201d This should not\nsurprise us. Far away in Tahiti, the sun-god was also known by the name of Ra.\u201d Thus, in\nSemitic, Babylon was rendered Bab-el, which translates as \u201cGate of El.\u201d The non-Semitic\nKassites, however, seem to have referred to the city as Ka-ra, in which \u201cra\u201d stood for the\nSemitic El.'\n\nr | Vhe Egyptian god Atum bore a specific and strange characteristic.

George Rawlinson, writing in 1885, who\ndid not accept the identification of god with planet, had this to say concerning this ancient\nbelief:\n\n\u201cThe identification of the Chaldean II fie. El] or Ra with Saturn, which Diodorus\nmakes, and which may seem to derive some confirmation from Philo-Byblius, is cer-\ntainly incorrect, so far as the planet Saturn, which Diodorus especially mentions, is\nconcerned; but it may be regarded as having a basis of truth, inasmuch as Saturn was\nin one sense the chief of the gods...\u201d\n\nThis, however, seems to have been the bane of mythologists from day one, in that they\nhave always had the audacity to proclaim that, thousands of years after the fact, they are in a\nbetter position to know what the ancients believed than the very ancients themselves. Given\nall this, may we not assume that Atum, who was but a facet of Ra, had also originated as a\npersonification of the planet Saturn.? But then, if Atum was honored as a sun of night, should\nwe not expect that so, also, had been Ra? This is exactly what we find. In a hymn, Ra is\nlauded as \u201cthe one alone... lying awake while all men lie asleep.\u201d And if some find that\nsomewhat ambiguous, it is made clearer in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, where the god in\nquestion is unambiguously made to state: \u201cI am that god Re who shineth in the night.\u201d\n\nBesides Atum and Ra, this sun of night was also anthropomorphosed by the Egyptians as\nthe god Osiris. Mariette-Bey long ago wrote that: \u201cOriginally, Osiris is the nocturnal sun; he\nis the primordial night of chaos; he is consequently anterior to Ra, the Sun of Day.\u201d * As we\nhave already seen, however, Ra, also, was considered a sun of night so that, in this respect,\n\n\u201d Tbid., p. 74.\n\n\u00aeR.

Thus, in a vignette of\nthe Book of the Dead, as elsewhere, the disk of Ra, usually said to be that of the Sun, is\n which was the emblem of Osiris.\u201d Else-\nwhere in the same work, Atum is made to utter: \u201cI am yesterday.\u201d But a few lines later it is\nstated that: \u201cYesterday is Osiris.\u201d\u00ae But let\u2019s cut across the lawn since the very same work\nleaves little doubt as to the equation of Ra with Osiris. In the liturgy for the dead, it is\nasked \u2014 and answered:\n\n\u201cWho then is this? It is Osiris,\u2019, Ra is his name, even Ra the self-\ncreated.\u201d\u2122\n\nIn other sections of the same work, Ra is presented as the soul of Osiris, while Osiris is\npresented as the soul of Ra, thus again indicating that the two gods were merely aspects of\neach other.\u201d As Lepsius pointed out, in the Book of the Dead, Osiris is even referred to as\nOsiris-Ra, while Isis, who was the wife of Osiris, is even there called \u201cthe royal consort of\nRa.\u201d It was precisely this assimilation with Ra that drove earlier mythologists to equate\nOsiris with the Sun.\u201d James Frazer, of course, had his own reason for disagreeing with this\nidentification since, as far as he was concerned, Osiris had been nothing more than a god of\nvegetation.\u201d\n\nActually, the identification of Osiris as a Saturnian deity, and even as a personification of\nthe planet Saturn itself, is anything but new, having been proffered by many a mythologist.\u201d\nImmanuel Velikovsky was much in agreement with this identification.\u201d Few of these writers,\nhowever, ever presented any direct evidence that ties Osiris to Saturn. William Heidel was at\nleast shrewd enough to point out that, just as Osiris was considered the judge of the dead, so,\nalso, was Kronos/Saturn.\u201d But it is not this or that particular datum that makes our case, but,\nrather, the collective weight of various clues and diligent reasoning. And to add to what we\nhave already enumerated, I offer next the following information which refers us back to En-\n\nMe Sar-ra, that epithet of Shamash/Saturn which, as we have already seen, means \u201cLord of\nthe Law of the Universe.\u201d The Indic Brahma, whom we have already seen identified as the\nsame planet, was also honored as the \u201cLord of the Universe.\u201d\u201d It could not then be through\ncoincidence that another name for Osiris happens to be Neb-er-tcher, which also means \u201cgod\nof the universe.\u201d\u201d\n\n18 W.

                "content": "Nevertheless, at this point we have to return to the question: How many Egyptian deities\nare we going to identify as personifications of the planet Saturn? Or why were there so many\nnames\u2014and we shall be meeting many others\u2014within the same nation for one and the same\nplanet? Once again, I will let Mullen answer this one\u2014at least in part. As he wrote:\n\n\u201cOne cause for the complexity of the account is that when the Nile valley was united\nin one kingdom, it consisted of many tribes, each with its own names for the\nplanetary gods and its own stories about them. After unification the cults of these\ngods were preserved and conflated even though in many cases one and the same\nplanet was being worshipped under different names in different places.\u201d*\n\nAs time went by, the ancestral memory of these former times dimmed. In Egypt, the sac-\nred litanies continued to be chanted even when a full understanding of their content was part-\nially lost. Eventually, even the identities of the gods were forgotten; and were it not for the\npresent-day rediscoveries of ancient texts, we would be in no better position. In Egypt, a time\ncame when not only were planetary deities worshipped under different names in different\nplaces, but also in the very same nomes under the roof of the very same temples.\n\nWhen one remembers that this evolutionary process took place, not only in Egypt, but\nthroughout the entire world, one begins to appreciate the complexity of the mytho-historical\nrecord and the reason behind the legion of names which now burden the gods of humankind.\nAll of which reminds us of Fred Bratton\u2019s words when he had it stated that: \u201cIt has been es-\ntimated that a list of Sumerian deities [alone] would contain more than five thousand\nnames.\u201d Add to that the thousands of deities from other ancient civilizations and the mind\nboggles. Let us face it, we are here talking about an astronomical number of divinities. Could\nwe really hope to attach them all to just five planets, those which the ancients could see with\nthe naked eye? And yet, as we saw on an earlier page, that is precisely what Giorgio de San-\ntillana and Hertha von Dechend claimed:\n\n\u201cThe real actors on the stage of the universe are few, if their adventures are\nmany...The forces reside in the starry heavens, and ail the stories, characters and ad-\n\n|W.

A prodigious assignment it may seem for those few planets to\naccount for all those stories...\u201d*\n\nA prodigious assignment it surely is, but not an entirely impossible one because, for one\nthing, many of these deities turn out to be nothing but aliases of each other. Take Osiris, for\nexample, seeing as we are on that subject\u2014the god was known under sixty different names in\nthe Theban recension, up to c. 1600 B.C., 4 which had accumulated to one hundred and fifty-\neight by the time of the Saite recension in c. 300 B.C.* In the Babylonian Enuma Elish,\nsometimes referred to as the Babylonian Creation Epic, the god Marduk is given fifty\nnames.\u201d And if you think that these two examples constitute extremes, think again. The In-\ndic god Shiva is claimed to bear one thousand and eight different names.\u201d In fact, it will be\nfound that most of the deities of antiquity are merely aliases of each other. Nor will I be bold\nenough to proctaim that ail these mythological characters are to be identified as planets since\nsome actually personify planetary powers, while others are associated with various celestial\nphenomena.\n\nBut, before we lose the thread of our present topic, another question should now be\nasked: Was it only in Egypt that Saturn was lauded as a sun of night?",

Besides, what has the slowness of a planet\nto do with its brightness?\n\nJastrow went on to state that the light of the Moon, as well as that of the other planets and\nthe stars, was, by the Babylonians, ascribed to Saturn. But would the Babylonians, who\ncould calculate the complex motions of the heavenly bodies with mathematical accuracy, as\nwe have seen in a previous chapter, have been so naive as to invent a concept in which even\nthe most ignorant of their peasantry could hardly have believed? Should we not rather believe\nthe words of Diodorus when he stated that the reason the Chaldeans called Saturn by the\nname of the Sun was because it was the most prominent of the five planets or the stars?\n\nA colleague of Jastrow, Professor J. A. Montgomery, has even raised \u201cthe interesting\nquestion whether in Genesis 1:16 the two \u2018lights\u2019 may not at one time have referred to the\nSun and Saturn?\u201d* Without realizing that the second body might have been Saturn, James\nStrickling also suggested a similar interpretation.\u201c While I do not wish to use this particular\ndatum as evidence of anything, I have to admit that it is an interesting supposition for, in the\nBiblical passage referred to, which supposedly describes the creation of Sun and Moon, nei-\nther Sun nor Moon is mentioned. The passage merely reads:\n\n\u201cAnd Elohim [usually translated as \u2018God\u2019] made two great lights; the greater light to\nrule the day, and the iesser light to rule the night: He made the stars also.\u201d*",

A floor mosaic, showing Helios riding in his four-horse chariot, was discov-\nered at the Beth Alpha Synagogue, dating to the sixth century A.D., in Israel\u2019s Jezreel Valley.\nIn it, the god is depicted riding through the night, with the Moon and a sky \u201csprinkled with\nstars\u201d behind him. The incongruity has been explained by claiming that \u201c[t]he night\nsky...still shines around him.\u201d At no time, however, can the night sky continue to shine\naround the Sun once it has risen. In view of the fact that Helios was originally interchange-\nable with Kronos/Saturn, the mosaic in question should be allowed to speak for itself. What it\nportrays is Helios as Saturn shining at night.\n\nCarl Jung, among few, understood this much. He, too, had come across references to a\nsun of night.
