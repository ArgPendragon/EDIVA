His \u201cchild\u201d was Shamash, often\nreferred to as Shamash mar Sin\u2014i. e. Shamash son of Sin.\u201d\n\nThis led William Albright to state that \u201cNingirsu is here the sun...who ascends each\nmorning from the underworld.\u201d\u201d That Albright was not well acquainted with the character-\nistics of this deity is further illustrated when he also opined that \u201cNingirsu, like Ninurta,\nseems to have been primarily a god of fertility with intimate solar associations.\u201d\u201d Albright\ndid recognize that Ningirsu has \u201csolar associations,\u201d but that Ningirsu was Saturn and not the\nSun had already been demonstrated by Jastrow.\u201d\n\nThis identification is based on a series of deductions which not only proves the ancient\nidentity of Ningirsu but also that of Ninurta. These deductions lead us back to those omens\nincorporating the formula \u201cwhen Shamash stands in the halo of Sin\u201d that we have already\nhad occasion to note.

As is widely known, the scythe was the favored\nweapon of Kronos/Saturnus. Thus, as Jastrow admitted, Franz Kugler was correct in identify-\ning \u201c whose name is Ninib [i.e. Ninurta]\u201d as referring to Saturn.\u201d And,\nlet\u2019s face it, in a bilingual list of the planets, now in the British Museum, Ninurta is definitely\nlisted as the name of the planet Saturn.\u201d\n\nNow it should be understood that the term \u201cLu-Bat\u201d was also used to designate Mars and\nMercury besides Saturn. A. F.

                "content": "Like that of other ancient nations, Hindu astronomy is inseparable from mythology. This\nparticular mythology, however, continues to thrive as the basis of Hindu religion. In a way, it\ncan therefore be said that, among the Hindus, planetary worship is practiced to this day\u2014and\nnot only in an indirect way. Here I would like to remind the reader of that passage from the\nLinga Purana we had earlier looked at which admonishes that \u201cthe worship of the planets\nshould be pursued by good men.\u201d\u00ae Moreover, the reason behind this admonition is the ward-\ning-off of evil at times of planetary \u201charassment.\u201d That, in these modem times, not many\npracticing Hindus are even aware of these words, and that few, if any, among them actually\npractice planetary worship, is besides the point. What is at issue here is that the admonition in\nquestion is contained in one of the missals, if you wish, by which one of the world\u2019s great\nliving religions is meant to abide.\n\nLike the gods of other nations, Vedic deities are known by more than one name or epithet\nas so, also, are the planets. Thus, one of the names for the Sun in Sanskrit is Arka.\u00ae But then\nwe find that three related designations for the planet Saturn in the same language are Arki,\u00ae\nArka-putra,\u201d and Arkatanayah.\u2122 Both Arka-putra and Arkatanayah translate as \u201cson of the\nSun.\u201d \u00a9 Arkaja, which means \u201csun-born\u201d can also be applied to the planet Saturn,\u201d as so,\nalso, can Arkanandana.\u201d So, once again, we find the planet Saturn bearing a name which is\nshared by the Sun.\n\nHindu mythology, of course, is largely based on Vedic belief. And yet, as one critic\npointed out quite a few years ago, it has never been proved to the general satisfaction of In-\ndologists that any planets are mentioned in the Vedas.\u201d As I had earlier written in reference\nto this criticism, however, this lack can be compensated for \u201cif it can be shown that certain\ndeities mentioned in the {Vedic] hymns possess planetary traits and/or characteristics com-\nparable to the [known] planetary deities of other nations.\u201d\u00ae Today I can go even further be-\ncause, if it can be shown that the names and/or epithets applied to the Vedic deities are iden-\ntical to those applied to the planets by the same race and in the same language, the equiva-\nlence of deities and planets is proven on home ground without any recourse or appeal to\ncomparative studies. Such, for instance, is the case with Brahma, the supreme creator of In-\ndian mythology.\n\nStrictly speaking, Brahma was not a Vedic deity. He more properly belongs to that corpus\nof Hindu lore known as Brahmanic mythology. He was proclaimed the first of the Devas,\nusually said to mean \u201cgods,\u201d but which properly translates as \u201cshining ones. Here it should\nbe noted that the Sanskrit adjective brahmanya means \u201crelating [or belonging] to Brahma. \u201d*\n\n\u00ae Tinga Purana , |:57:32-39.\n\nIbid.\n\n\u00aeV_S.

                "content": "And, as a qualification I should perhaps add that this does not mean that Ra never stood for\nthe Sun. It is obvious from texts of a historical, or narrative, but not mythological, nature\nthat the Sun was also referred to as Ra. But is this not the same situation we have found\namong other nations where the planet Saturn and the Sun are made to share the same name?\n\nMeanwhile, the Ptolemaic identification of Ra as Saturn is given additional credence by\nthe Greek poet known as Nonnus. A native of Panapolis in Ptolemaic Egypt, Nonnus like-\nwise referred to the Arabic Sun as Kronos\u201d which, again, was the same as calling the Sun\nby the name of Saturn.\n\nNow it is true that the Greeks, and after them the Romans, had a penchant for calling\nalien deities and celestial bodies by what they understood to be their Greek, or Roman, coun-\nterparts. It is also known that, in certain cases, their matching was somewhat arbitrary. But\nneither the planet Saturn nor the Sun could have contributed to such arbitrariness since both\nluminaries were beyond confusion. So why would Nonnus have chosen to call the Arabic\nSun by the name of the planet Saturn? Is not one inclined to assume that a similar ambiguity\nbetween the Sun and the planet Saturn must have existed in Arabic nomenclature? And does\nthis not indicate that the Graeco-Egyptian who had it recorded that Ra stood for Kro-\nnos/Saturn was, in fact, echoing the popular belief of the time?\n\nThe Greeks, of course, had their own lore to draw upon. Not only did they, as we have\nseen, refer to the planet Saturn as the star of Helios, that is the star of the Sun, they actually\n wrote that pre-\neminent among the planets for its slowness was the one whom \u201csome call ...Kronos,\u201d!\u201d\nwhich is Saturn. But, in the earliest copies of the text, the name used was not Kronos but,\nrather, Helios.\" It was only later copyists, who could not understand why the planet Saturn\nwas here being alluded to by the name of the Sun, who \u201ccorrected\u201d the text to read \u201cKronos,\u201d\nthe \u201caccepted\u201d Greek name of the planet Saturn. As Franz Boll, whose illuminating study of\nthis subject has long been ignored, demonstrated, the practice of \u201ccorrecting\u201d such\ntexts\u2014changing the name \u201cHelios\u201d to read \u201cKronos\u201d\u2014was quite common among later\ncopyists.\u201d!\n\nTo Porphyry, originally named Malchus, the Greek historian and Neoplatonist from Tyre,\nin Syria, Kronos/Saturn was also called Helios\u2019? as it was to Rhetorios and Claudius\nPtolemy himself.'* All of which further indicates that the Ptolemaic identification of Ra as\nKronos/Saturn was in keeping with the belief of the time.\n\nAs it happens, the name \u201cHelios\u201d closely resembles the Greek transliteration of the Ca-\nnaanite/Phoenician \u201cEl,\u201d that is \u201cElos,\u201d a deity who, as Philo Byblius proclaimed, was the\nsame as Kronos/Saturn.\"* Thus a confusion between the names Elos and Helios has been\nsuggested to be at the root of this belief.\"\u00b0 This point is somewhat tacky because, in my\nopinion, the Greek Helios, together with similar divinities incorporating the same philol-\nogical root, does ultimately derive from El.

Besides, as Boll pointed out, and as we have seen, the association of Saturn\nwith the Sun was much too widespread to be attributed to a Greek confusion based on\nPhilo.\" Boll\u2019s own conclusion was that the naming of the planet Saturn as Helios was not\ndue to any confusion of names, and hardly a confusion of the luminaries involved, but owed\nits cause to the simple fact that, originally, Helios and Kronos were one and the same god\nand, therefore, one and the same planet\u2014that is Saturn.'\u201d\n\nAmbrosius Theodosius Macrobius, the Roman philosopher and grammarian whe lived\nbetween 395 and 423 A.D., has been much maligned for claiming, in the first book of his\nSaturnalia, that all forms of worship derived from that of the Sun. Among the misconcep-\ntions that are laid at his door is his identification of Kronos as the Sun.'\u00ae But, having learned\nwhat we now have, can we honestly say that Macrobius was that much in error? Was he not,\nin his own way, reporting what his ancestors, and those of the Greeks before them, had be-\nlieved\u2014that Saturn bore the name of the Sun?\" Should we fault him for believing that this\nsun was the same Sun that shone daily above his head? Have we not now seen that most\nmodern mythologists have been trapped into committing the same error?\n\nThis belief was so inbred in the early sciences it even turns up in alchemy, the foster-\nmother of chemistry. When astrology embraced, and thus debased, what had commenced as a\nmonopolized industry in the transformation of base metals into gold-simulating alloys by the\npriestly caste of Alexandria, ancient astronomical lore entrenched itself in mystical treatises\nthat were to obsess alchemists well past medieval times. Among these astro-chemical echoes\nwe encounter the statement that the planet Saturn constitutes \u201cthe best sun,\u201d!\u201d which reminds\nus of Saturn as the \u201ctrue sun\u201d believed in by Hindu sages. As David Talbott well realized:\n\n\u201c_. jit is unlikely that [the alchemists] themselves knew what to do with the idea. But\nthat the tradition was passed down from remote antiquity is both indisputable and\ncrucial.\u201d\n\nThis belief was so deeply entrenched that the Swiss psychologist, Carl Jung, could refer\nto Saturn as \u201cthe second sun\u201d as if the oddity was well known.

                "content": "about except as a curiosity. In this respect, it was no different then than it is now.\n\nGranted that religion would have augmented the belief until it fossilized itself into a\ncredo of faith, the question of why such an obvious falsity would have been incorporated in\nritual litanies in the first place remains unanswered. More amazing is the fact that the belief\nsurvived the scrutiny of those who were in the best position to know otherwise\u2014the as-\ntronomers and astrologers. How could these professional men have attempted to utilize the\ndatum in a more practical way when the belief on which it was based belied reality.\n\nWe can, perhaps, understand how an error in astronomical observation, or a miscalculated\nset of figures, could have been misconstrued into a truth. Habitual acceptance of such a mis-\nconstrued fact might even, in time, have cemented the misconception into dogmatic belief. It\nhappens. But the incongruity of a belief in something which was demonstrably false would\nhave had a difficult time in being accepted as dogma by a culture and installed as a pillar of\nastrological wisdom supposedly based on astronomical verity. It is difficult to understand\nwhy ancient astronomers, astrologers, or priests looked up at the planet Saturn and asserted\nthat it was a sun. More difficult to believe would be that such a preposterous idea, even if it\nwas somehow believed in, say, by the Babylonians, could have been foisted on a people of a\ndifferent culture. Everyone could look up into the sky and see that Saturn was not a sun. One\nneed not have been an astronomer in order to expose such a deceit.\n\nWhat people might have believed is that Saturn could have once shone as a sun. This\nwould have been different because although everyone could see that Saturn did not shine as a\nsun, there was no way they could tell whether it once did. And, let us face it, man has long\nbeen prone to the possibility that things could have been different in remote antiq-\nuity\u2014which renders this very study beyond exception.\n\nOn the other hand, whether imbedded in fact or fiction, every belief has to have an origin.\nSo what could have been the origin of this particular one? One explanation offered by Pin-\ngree is that the Sun\u2019s hyposoma sets as Saturn\u2019s rises. A hyposoma\u2014plural, hyposo-\nmata~~is the astrological term for the point in the zodiacal sign in which a planet is believed\nto exert its greatest influence. But, as Ulla Koch-Westenholz noted, \u201cthe earliest evidence for\nthe hyposomata is from the seventh century BC, and the association of Saturn and the sun\nis certainly older and far more entrenched in the tradition than warranted by such arcane\nspeculations.\u201d The classicist R. Beck had a different explanation. As he had it stated:\n\n\u201cIn ancient astrology it is widely attested...that Satur was the star of the\nSun...Graeco-Roman astrology made the [same] identification because Babylonian\nastrology had made it already, and the western tradition here simply drew on its older\neastern relative.\u201d\n\nBut the Babylonians and, before them, the Sumerians, had absolutely no reason to invent\nthe postulate, to perpetrate this astronomical lie. It could have served no purpose\u2014religious,\npolitical, or otherwise. It would not have answered any questions posed by theology, sover-\neignty, or nature. Besides, if we are to invoke diffusion as a solution to this problem, how\nwould we explain similar beliefs from the American continent which, we have been taught,\ncould have had absolutely no contact with the world of the ancient Near East? I will not, at\n\n\"3, Koch-, pp. 122-123.\n\n14 And see here, S. Langdon, op. cit., p. 304.",
