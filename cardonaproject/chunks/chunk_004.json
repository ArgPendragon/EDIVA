Here, an illustra-\ntion offered by Bob Forrest comes immediately to mind.\n\n\u201cI can imagine how odd anomalies could arise in transmission, and this point was\nbrought home to me by a curious example I came across just recently: Cinderella\u2019s\nglass slipper. I had always found it peculiar that the slipper should be said to be made\nof glass, but according to Brewer\u2019s \u2018Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\u2019 this came about\nvia a mistranslation of the phrase \u2018pantoufle en vair\u2019 as \u2018a glass slipper\u2019\n(pantoufle en verre). 1 do not suppose, though, that the vagaries of oral transmission\ncan account for more than the odd \u2018peculiarity\u2019 of a myth, legend or story.\u201d\u00ae\n\nAnother example concerns one of the most famous sayings attributed to Jesus: \u201cIt is eas-\nier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the king-\ndom of God.\u201d\u2122 As Vitaliano indicated, this is more than probably a mistranslation of the\nGreek, in which the Gospels were originally written, where the Greek word for\n\u201crope\u201d \u2014 kameylos \u2014was mistranslated as \u201ccamel\u201d \u2014- kamelos. \u2122 This is because the sound of\nthe Greek letter era sounds very similar to that of epsilon to a foreign ear. Thus the words of\nJesus should be translated as: \u201cIt is easier for a rope to go through the eye of a needle, than\nfor a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God\u201d\u2014which, let\u2019s face it, makes for a better\nsimile.\n\nWhen it comes to Hebrew, in which the books of the Old Testament were originally set\ndown, we encounter even greater difficulties because, for one thing, Biblical Hebrew was\nwritten without vowels, thus making for confusion between words containing the same con-\nsonants but different vowel sounds, and, for another, there are over a thousand Hebrew words\nwhich appear only in the Old Testament, and, in some cases, appear there only once. How,\nthen, without comparison, can the meaning of such words be verified with certainty?\n\nAs will be seen in forthcoming pages, such mistranslations, which owe more to the writ-\nten word than they do to oral tradition, permeate the mythological sources of most ancient\nnations. But, rather than proving detrimental to our cause, such mistranslations, where found,\nshail actually help us ferret out the truth.\n\n\u201c, p. 96.\n\n\u00ae B.

                "content": "The casual reader of popular mythology may not realize to what extent the subject is in-\nfused with astronomical content. This is partly due to the aversion displayed by most modern\nmythologists to anything in their studies that smacks of astronomical connections. This is so\ntrue that when Girogio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend dared to go against the com-\nmon trend in their monumental work, Hamilet\u2019s Mill, they found the doors of academia closed\nshut in their face. As Martin Bernal found reason to state:\n\n\u201cHaving written a major book on Galileo, de Santillana [whom Bernal qualifies as\npossibly the greatest historian of Renaissance science] became interested in the Her-\nmetic Egyptian tradition; then, late in life, he read Dupuis\u2019s Origine de tous les cultes,\nand was convinced by its argument that much of ancient mythology was indeed alle-\ngory for scientific astronomy.\n\n\u201cDespite de Santillana\u2019s enormous reputation, Hamlet\u2019s Mill\u2014the book in which he\nand a younger German colleague [Hertha von Dechend] set out [such a mytho-astro-\nnomical] scheme\u2014was not accepted by any university press and was published com-\nmercially. This means that respectable scholars are not obliged to take such work into\naccount. In addition, de Santitlana\u2019s having stuck his neck out so far lessened his ef-\nfectiveness as a [historian]. Furthermore, his work ... could be tumped together with\na more or less \u2018lunatic fringe\u2019; this allowed or even compelled orthodox scholars to\nignore it.\u201d\n\nEarlier in this century, mythologists were quite aware of the astronomical nature of an-\ncient myths, but, of lately, the general assumption has been that these astral connections are\nof fate derivation, having been foisted on an already existing mythology. So much can be\nsaid against this that volumes, of which this is one, can be written.\n\nThe problem, however, goes deeper than that because even those earlier mythologists\nwho had accepted the astronomical nature of the myths were themselves often guilty of tam-\npering with their sources so that, today, it is not easy to discern what these ancient sources\nreally had to say about the cosmic powers our ancestors venerated. This is not to be\nwondered at because, if one had to pursue the astronomical motifs inherent in most of\nmythology, one would be forced to assume that the ancients\u2019 perception of the celestial\nsphere was entirely different from that of modern man. Thus, when modern mythologists\npursue these astral myths, they tend to look up at the sky, if only figuratively, and realize that\nwhat the ancient records state about the planets, and even the Sun and Moon, bears\nabsolutely no resemblance to the present Solar System. And yet one must keep in mind that\nthese self-same ancients, as we shall see in the next chapter, were quite sophisticated when it\ncame to observational astronomy. Thus something of a dilemma faces the mythologist as was\npoignantly demonstrated, a few decades ago, by Irene Nicholson.\n\nIn a Mayan scheme purported to describe the celestial sphere, Nicholson discovered that\nthe planet Venus was positioned above the Sun, below which was the Milky Way and, below\nthat, the Moon.\u201d Knowing full well that the Maya had been better astronomers than that, she\nattempted to circumvent the problem by blaming these disparities on a faulty record.\n\n\u201d M.

                "content": "attributed to Ra do not fit the role of the Sun.\n\nThus, for example, Ra was often lauded as \u201cLord of the Circles\u201d and as \u201che who entereth\nfor liveth} in the Circle.\u201d\u201d He was described as \u201cthe sender forth of light into his Circle\u201d and\nas the \u201cGovernor of [his] circle.\u201d*\n\nWhat is this Circle that the hymns allude to? Egyptologists will immediately inform us\nthat this Circle of which the hymns speak was what the Egyptians referred to as the Duat (or\nTuat), a word that has been rendered into English as \u201cthe Underworld.\u201d That may be so, but\nthe fact remains that Ra was said to have shone from within it. What becomes obvious, in\nother words, is that, whatever Ra once signified, it was a celestial body that resided within a\ncircle or band or ring. As we all know, the Sun does not send forth its rays into a circle; it\ndoes not reside in a ring.\n\nThere will now be those who will tell me that, under certain conditions, the Sun is seen to\nbe surrounded by a ring. They will of course be alluding to that atmospheric re fraction which\nlends a halo, known as parhelia, to the solar orb. But not only is this too rare an apparition to\nhave earned Ra his title of \u201cGovernor of his Circle\u201d and/or \u201cLord of the Circles,\u201d it is also a\nphenomenon that is restricted to northern regions and hardly, if ever, seen at the latitude of\nEgypt. But there is more.\n\nWhen pictured on the walls of temples and on papyri, Ra is often shown surmounted with\na red or golden disc, which is not inappropriate if the Sun is truly being represented. In the\nliturgies dedicated to him, however, Ra is described as having shed a green, rather than a\ngolden, light. Thus a hymn to Ra states: \u201cThou hast come with thy splendours, and thou hast\nmade heaven and earth bright with thy rays of pure emerald light.\u201d\n\nIn another hymn we read: \u201cO Ra ... the heir of eternity, self-begotten and self-born, king\nof earth, prince of the netherworld ... thou dost rise in the horizon of heaven and sheddest\nupon the world beams of emerald light ...\u201c\u00a9\n\nNot only did this sun shed a green, or emerald, light, it itself was green. As Donald\nMackenzie informed his readers, in his form of Sebek-Tum-Ra, this sun was the \u201cradiant\ngreen disk.\u201d \u201cHail Green One,\u201d was the manner in which Ra was lauded,\u201d\n\nMythologists have nothing to say by way of explaining why the ancient Egyptians al-\nluded to the Sun as having been green and shedding a green light. And, as long as they con-\ntinue to believe that Ra was the Sun, how can they? Does our Sun shed a green light? Is the\ndisk of the present sun green?\n\nConsider further the motions of the celestial object called Ra. In a statement found in one\nof the Coffin Texts, the deity is addressed with these words: \u201cYou shall go up upon the great\nWest side of the sky and go down upon the great East side of the earth.\u201d Is not this contrary\nto what the present Sun does? Does the Sun today \u201cgo up\u201d in the west? Does it \u201cgo down\u201d in\nthe east?

This is especially true, but not restricted to, the\ntales contained in the Old Testament and those that constitute what is generally termed Clas-\nsical mythology. To give but just two examples:\n\nIn chapter six of the Book of Genesis, which describes the loading of the ark in prepara-\ntion for the coming deluge, it is written that God commanded Noah to take aboard two, a\nmale and a female, of every living beast.\u201d But in chapter seven of the same book, the com-\nmand to Noah is to take aboard two only of unclean beasts, but seven of every clean beast as\nwell as of every kind of fowl.\u201d Why the difference?\n\nThe second example I will give comes from Greek mythology and concerns the goddess\nAthena. According to Hesiod, the father of Greek didactic poetry, Athena was born from the\nhead of Zeus,\u201d a tale that became very popular among the ancient Greeks. But, despite the\nnotability of Hesiod\u2019s tale, Athena\u2019s parentage, as also the nature of her birth, was not\nunanimously agreed upon among the Hellenes. To some it was Poseidon who fathered\nAthena, Zeus becoming her adopted father only because the goddess disowned the god of the\nsea.\u201d To others, Athena\u2019s father was Itonus, king of Iton in Phithiotis.\u00ae Next in popularity to\nHesiod\u2019s tale was that which claimed that Athena was fathered by the giant Pallas whom she\nlater slew and flayed.\u201d According to Apollodorus, on the other hand, Pallas was the name of\nAthena\u2019s playmate whom she also slew, but accidentally, while engaged in friendly\n\n8 Ibid.\n\n% Ibid. p. 86.\n\n\u00ae Pyramid Texts, Spell 1133.\n\n\u00ae Coffin Texts , Spell 136.\n\n\u00ae Genesis 6: 19-20.\n\n Ibid., 7: 2-3.\n\n%!

                "content": "the shores of Lake Tritonis in North Africa,\u201d, the\ndeity of the lake.\u201d Philo Byblius, basing his report on that of Sanchoniathon and quoted by\nEusebius of Caesarea, stated that Athena was the daughter of Kronos.*\n\nSo which of these versions, if any, is the correct one? Better still: If, as stated above,\nmythic lore was faithfully transmitted by word of mouth through the ages before it became\nengraved in writing, how did we end up with so many different versions of the same tale?\nWhile it is tempting to blame such contradictions on faulty recording when these myths were\nfirst written down, such is not always the case.\n\nThe example given above concerning Noah from the Book of Genesis was not chosen at\nrandom. It was chosen specifically to clarify a conundrum.\n\nThus, in that passage which tells that only two of every beast was to be taken aboard the\nark, the instructions come from Elohim, an ancient name which is usually translated as\n\u201cGod\u201d in most English versions of the Old Testament. But in the passage which specifies that\nseven should be the number taken on board of the beasts designated as clean, the command is\nsaid to have come from Yahweh, sometimes rendered \u201cJehovah,\u201d another ancient name\nwhich is usually translated as \u201cthe Lord\u201d in English versions of the same work.\n\nWe shall not, at this point, involve ourselves in a discussion concerning whether or not\nthese two names\u2014 Yahweh and Elohim\u2014were but two different designations for one and the\nsame deity. We shall leave that for later. Biblical scholars, however, had long ago realized\nthat the Old Testament preserves more than one tradition, and that, among other things, these\ndifferent traditions can be recognized by the name applied to what one usually considers as\nhaving been \u201cGod.\u201d One of these traditions referred to the deity as Elohim, another tradition\nreferred to him as Yahweh. Thus Biblical scholars refer to these different versions, among\nothers, as the Elohist tradition on the one hand, and the Yahwist tradition on the other. Origi-\nnally, these different traditions belonged to different peoples who had passed on their tradi-\ntions by word of mouth, without change, from one generation to the next. But, as happened\nso often in the past, these different peoples merged to become one nation even though each\nfaction was persistent in retaining its particular version of what they believed to have tran-\nspired in the past. At an even later time, when they decided to put their history into writing,\nthese various traditions were incorporated as a unified, but not seamless, whole. And that, to\nput it simply, is what the Old Testament, as it exists today, consists of.\n\nSo, similarly, with the ancient Greeks, who referred to themselves as Hellenes, suppos-\nedly after Helen of Troy, a nation that was forged from the remnants of earlier civilizations\nand wandering tribes\u2014Pelasgians, Minoans, Mycenaeans, Achaeans, Trojans, Ionians, Dori-\nans, and heaven knows whe else\u2014each of whom brought their own traditions into that Indo-\nEuropean melting pot that has become known as Greek history and Classical mythology.\n\nEven so, why should there be more than one version of any one particular myth? Here |\ncan best ask the reader to consider an event from the modern world\u2014the blowing up, by the\ninvading army, of the colossal swastika that had towered above the Germans in symbolic\nsplendor above so many Nazi rallies. As Lewis Greenberg noted: \u201cThere appears to be some\nconfusion over which swastika was dynamited, with some opting for one over the Reichstag\n\n% Apollodorus, Bibliotheka, lil: 12: 3; see also Pausanias, op. cit., IX: 33: 5.\n*~ Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica, TV; 1310.\n\n*\u201d, p. 249.\n\n* Eusebius Pamphili, Praeparatio Evangelica, |: X: 36, 38.\n\n28",
