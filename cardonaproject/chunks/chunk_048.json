                "content": "applied to our Satumian model. As Jueneman expiained it, a Rankine vortex consists of\n\u201cnested cylinders of atmospheric gases and debris, one within another, each separated by\ndensity gradients caused by pressure, thermal, and perhaps electrical differentials.\u201d\u00ae But what\nwould have been the cause of such a planetary vortex?\n\nAs explained in a previous chapter, proto-Satun\u2019s proximity would have raised a litho-\nspheric bulge in Earth\u2019s northern region, the shadow of which exists to this day. But, too, as\nthere explained, Earth\u2019s hydrosphere and atmosphere would also have responded to proto-\nSaturn\u2019s attractive force. As Jueneman clarified, this gravitational force would have been en-\nhanced by the inertia inherent in the synchronous rotation of the planetary pair. Thus the\ngentle westerly winds of lower latitudes \u201cwould have turned into increasingly violent south-\nwesterly gales\u201d at higher ones. In their northward spiral, aided by coriolis effects, these hur-\nricane winds would then have towered above Earth\u2019s north polar region.\u00b0\n\n\u201cThe tremendous energy of forward motion in the air mass, imparted by the relatively\nclose proximity of the northern celestial body, would have been converted into angu-\nlar momentum, increasing the velocity of this atmospheric maelstrom as it continued\nto accelerate into a tighter and tighter spiral. Finally, it would have sent a towering\ntornado-like polar column beyond the upper atmosphere and deep into space, ever\nreaching toward the northern body and forming a gaseous bridge in an attempt to span\nthe void between.\u201d!0\n\nThe beauty of this model is that, unlike Talbott\u2019s flow of debris and Rose\u2019s flux tube, it\nreadily explains the whirlwind motion attributed to the mythological axis mundi. But does it\nlend itself to a ray of light shining from above? After all, as we all know, tornadoes are any-\nthing but luminescent. They are, on the contrary, often very dark in appearance, some of\nthem close to black, and definitely opaque enough to mask their internal lightning displays.\nAnd yet, external luminosities have been known to accompany tornadoes such as that which\nroared through St. Louis in 1959. This was described by various witnesses as having been of\n\u201ca continuous illumination,\u201d \u201ca flame-like flare right up from the horizon,\u201d and of \u201cthe shape\nof a broad sword.\u201d!! Others have been described as having a \u201cbeautiful electric blue light\u201d\naround them, or of looking \u201clike a searchlight beam\u201d extending down to the skyline.'?\n\nJueneman himself attributes various electrical and light activity occurring within his\nplanetary vortex!3 but, as he described it, much like the tornado mentioned above, the overall\nappearance of the planetary vortex would have been a \u201cbluish color\u201d of \u201cexquisite bril-\nliance...encased in a pale green envelope.\u201d '4 Granted that some of these effects stem from\nJueneman\u2019s objective perceptivity, it is difficult to judge how much of them might also be\ndue to his fertile speculation.\n\nFor years I had accepted Jueneman\u2019s model as being a tentative valid prototype of the\nmythological polar column.

                "content": "Andrew Gray discovered a bright strand, 150 light years long and a couple wide, near the\ncentre of the Milky Way. Dubbed \u201cthe Snake,\u201d it is similar to other so-called \u201cthreads\u201d which\nhave been discovered within the barrel-shaped region of space known as the Galactic Centre\nLobe. Gray himself is of the opinion that the Snake \u201cis an electrical discharge, like a vast\nlightning boli\u2014so vast that it just hangs in space, instead of disappearing as earthly lightning\ndoes.\u201d20\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201ccorkscrew motion\u201d of the jet, as mentioned above, originates from the\nplasma\u2019s discharge system. As Thornhill succinctly explained:\n\n\u201c|. plasma is highly structured, allowing electric currents to flow through it along\nmagnetic field lines in the form of filaments, themselves twisted into ropes. Such\ntwisted filaments are seen in the powerful jets issuing from the cores of active galax-\nies, the tornadic clouds in the Lagoon nebula, the giant prominences streaming from\nthe sun, comet tails, etc.\u201d2!\n\nMoreover, these twisted filaments are not static, but highly active vortices,?? thus ac-\ncounting for the whirlwind motion endemic in the mythological axis mundi. But then,\nharking back to astral jets, is it known that these rotate? They surely do. Thus, for in-\nstance, data received from the Ulysses spacecraft showed that the twisting field lines\nconnected to both poles of the Sun rotate with it. As Thomhill stated: \u201cAstral jets are a\nmore active and visible manifestation of the same Birkeland currents.\u201d3 This, of course,\nhad already been ascertained by others, including Eric Lerner, who described such a jet as\n\u201ca plasma-pinching vortex filament.\u201d*4 As he explained:\n\n\u201cThe vortices are produced by a phenomenon known as the pinch effect. A straight\nthread of electric current flowing through a plasma surrounds itself with a cylindrical\nmagnetic field. This field attracts other currents flowing in the same direction. Thus\nthe tiny current threads tend to \u2018pinch\u2019 together, drawing the plasma with them. The\nconverging threads are twined into a plasma rope, much as water converging toward a\ndrain generates a swirling vortex.\u201d\n\nAs indicated by the diagram on the previous page, a Birkeland current has the appearance\nof two serpents twisted about each other. And was not Boreas originally said to have\npossessed serpent tails for feet? (Even so, it should be noted that the serpentine structure of\nthe axis mundi was not always visibly apparent, concerning which much more will be di-\nvulged in a future volume.)?\u00a9\n\nTaking his cue from Thornhill, Talbott, too, latched on to the polar jet theory.

                "content": "added:\n\n\u201cThis streaming of gases along the axis of rotation has, for 25 years, been part of the\nbedrock of the Saturn theory.\u201d 28\n\nNow while, as we have seen, it is true that the interpretation of the polar column as a\nstream of debris, now clarified as streaming gases, was part and parcel of Talbott\u2019s particular\nmodel since its inception, the interpretation of the same phenomenon as a plasma jet or dis-\ncharge was entirely new. Here it is more than evident that, while willing to accept cosmic\nplasma jets as scaled-up versions of proto-Saturn\u2019s boreal column, Talbott was not ready to\nrelinquish his original idea, and thus sought to amalgamate the two. Thornhill himself was\nnot exactly hostile to this unification. Thus, when questioned about Talbott\u2019s interpretation of\nthe polar column as a stream of fiery debris ejected toward Earth, he replied with these\nwords:\n\n\u201cI think that for most of the time [the polar column] would have been like a spec-\ntacular auroral effect with very little matter transfer taking place. It is only when it\ntransformed suddenly from a glow discharge to an arc that substantial matter would\nhave been transferred between bodies.\u201d 2?\n\nBut can a Birkeland current transfer matter between bodies? Apparently so. As Thornhill\nexplained:\n\n\u201cTo begin with, a rotating Birkeland current will form a tornado in an atmos-\nphere...Secondly, Eric Crew back in the 80s discussed how lightning usually acceler-\nates positive ions vertically, creating a jet of hot moist air at the top of the discharge\nchannel. In general terms the discharge compresses, heats and accelerates gases from a\nregion of high pressure to a region of lower pressure. So bulk matter is moved by an\nelectric discharge..\u201d3\u00a2\n\nThe tornadic quality of this sustained Birkeland current thus compensates for the loss of\nJueneman\u2019s Rankine vortex model.\n\nOr does it have to? After all, with the tidal heaping of the terrestrial atmosphere due to\nproto-Saturn\u2019s proximity combined with its inevitable spiraling motion, the effects proposed\nby Jueneman should have taken place. Even the twisting of the axis can be accounted for\nthrough the workings of a Rankine vortex. Just as terrestrial tornadoes \u201coccasionally exhibit\nsmaller counter-rotating vortices in close proximity to the primary whirlwind,\u201d so \u201con a\nmuch vaster scale, similar counter-rotating catenulate bolus flows would have snaked around\nthe polar column in filamentary fashion.\u201d?! Could it not, therefore, have been that both\ncauses, a planetary Rankine vortex and a sustained Birkeland current, have joined forces in\nproducing the most colossal tornado Earth has ever experienced? Or would the electrical\nforce inherent in a Birkeland current have overpowered the Rankine effect?\n\n271), Talbott, \u201cThe Saturn thesi\n28 Ibid.\n\n29 W.

It thus turns\nout, after all, that Lynn Rose\u2019s postulate is not as unsound as | had originally assumed. As\nstressed earlier, however, Io\u2019s flux tube is not optically visible. Neither are the Sun\u2019s pole-\nward emissions. As we have indicated, the mythological axis mundi, on the other hand,\nseems to have been very much visible. So are astral jets. Under what conditions, then, can a\nBirkeland current be made visible as a twisted ray of light? Needless to say, this might not be\nthe right question to ask, especially since Birkeland currents have already been explained as\ninvisible power transmission lines. Even so, as the plasma physicist Anthony Peratt stated at\nthe Laughlin World Conference sponsored by KRONIA Communications on July 8, 2001, a\nBirkeland current can be made visible through the detritus it may collect about it. What is,\nhowever, really visible is the plasma through which these currents flow. To be sure, the\nplasma itself needs to be made visible.\n\nAccording to the electrical engineer, Don Scott, there are three different modes in which\na plasma can operate, and these depend on the strength of the electrical current passing\nthrough it. In what is known as the dark current mode, where the electrical current is very\nlow, the plasma will not glow and, therefore, remains invisible. It can only be detected\nthrough the measurement of its electrical activity with sensitive instruments. As Scott ex-\nplains, the present magnetospheres of the Solar System planets \u201care examples of plasma op-\nerating in the dark current mode.\u201d But if the strength of the electrical current is \u201csignificant,\u201d\nthe entire plasma begins to glow, its brightness being naturally dependent on the strength of\nthe current. If the electrical current is very high, the plasma goes into arc mode, during which\nit \u201cradiates brilliantly over a wide spectrum,\u201d with the current tending to form the filaments\nwe are now becoming familiar with.3\n\nBut, with a current of 400,000 volts, why does lo\u2019s flux tube not glow? As Peratt ex-\nplains, given the size of the system, this is not a \u201cterribly impressive\u201d amplitude. Translating\ninto one mega-ampere, it even falls short of the seven mega-amperes conducted by Earth\u2019s\ncircular auroras, made visible in Earth\u2019s northern and southern polar skies (even though this\nvaries considerably).34 So that while it is the strength of the current passing through a plasma\nthat accounts for its ability to glow, this strength has to be considered in relation to the size of\nthe system that spawns it or, better said, in relation to the magnitude of the plasma itself. As\nScott explains further, it is not the actual current in total amperes that is the real issue, but the\ncurrent density, that is the amount of amperes per square meter.35\n\nActually, Peratt defines the situation even further and, at the risk of befuddling the lay\nreader, I hereby include his words for the benefit of the specialists. As he stated, whether a\nplasma glows or not relies on how energetic the relativistic electrons happen to be, plus the\nstrength of the magnetic field, \u201cas this determines the intensity of synchrotron radiation the\nelectrons beam towards Earth.\u201d3 Those who are interested enough can consult his major\nwork on the subject.37\n\nAs for our own proto-Saturnian polar col umn\u2014or \u201cpolar Birkeland current\u201d \u2014~Peratt es-\ntimates it to have probably carried something like \u201ca thousand mega-amperte into and out of\n\n32 W.

                "content": "As earlier stated, it would not be correct to claim that proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column was a\nstellar jet comparable to Herbig Haro objects. Even if scaled down from stellar amplitudes to\nbrown dwarf magnitudes, such jets would remain colossally active in their electrical mani-\nfestation. It is more than probable that proto-Saturn\u2019s polar ray did originate as such a jet, but\nitis doubtful that it still retained its full potential by the time man came upon the scene.\n\nAs Ken Moss suggested, it would have been more likely that the polar ray mankind re-\nmembers was, at best, the remnant of an original jet.2? And why not? After all, cosmic jets\nare known to fade. As Peratt disclosed in 1992:\n\n\u201cComparison of the integrated magnitude of the jet in M87 over the period 1934-1980\nshows that the jet is variable and has been fading, more or less uniformly, by about\n0.8 mag per decade between 1964 and 1980. The data imply that over the period\n1952-1980, the total jet intensity fell by at least 2.5 mag. Comparisons of isophotes\ntaken in 1964 and 1979 show no obvious differences in overall shape, apart from ef-\nfects of variation and noise. This indicates that the fading has affected the whole\nchannel uniformly since 1964...\u201d4\n\nThat jets fade is exemplified by our present Sun. The present poleward fields emanating\nfrom the Sun are so relatively weak that they operate in the dark mode. It is, however, doubt-\nful that they always did so.\n\nAs we shall soon see, brown dwarfs are believed to degenerate into giant gas planets.\nWhat this additionally means is that any jets spawned by such free floaters, already scaled\ndown, would necessarily continue to decay in their electrical amplitude. We have no way of\nknowing at what exact phase in its evolution the proto-Saturnian brown dwarf star had ar-\nrived at during the time of man, prior to its entry into our Solar System. It, however, seems\nreasonable to assume that it was well along its way in its evolutionary transformation. Even\nthe word \u201cjet\u201d might be misleading here where \u201c\u2018a sustained Birkeland current\u201d might much\nbetter fill the nomenclative bill.\n\nDespite all that, none of the above is to say that proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column was devoid\nof electrical activity, or that this activity failed to manifest itself in catastrophic dimensions.\nIt should, however, be emphasized that, during man\u2019s existence on Earth, the polar column\ndid not always exhibit its full tornadic force and, if we are to believe the mytho-historical re-\ncord, its twisted serpentine character was not always apparent. As seen from latitudinal dis-\ntance, very much as Thornhill intuited, the column would have appeared \u201clike a spectacular\nauroral effect,\u201d a tapering swath of light stretching all the way from proto-Saturn to Earth\u2019s\nnorth axial pole, a thing of beauty, even one of tranquility. Yes\u2014it would have been seen to\nwhirl, perhaps even accompanied by an electric hum. It is even possible that ancient man at-\ntempted to approach it. But as one came ever closer to it, its vibrational envelope, to say\nnothing of an electrical feel similar to that encountered prior to a storm, would have been felt\nas a warning against further approach.",

                "content": "oceans, hold large volumes of sediment.\u201d4! This bespeaks a different method from other\noceans by which these sediments were collected. Charles Ginenthal understood this extra\nthick sediment as having been deposited by \u201ca global, oceanic tidal wave, flowing north-\nward,\u201d This is a theory that has also been proposed by Jueneman.* As the latter indicated,\nhowever, such a flood, acting through waves of translation, would have been subject to\nEarth\u2019s rotation and would have swept from the equator in a colossal spiraling tide toward\nboth poles, to say nothing of travelling back toward the equator.\u201c That being the case, these\nwaves should just as easily have deposited their load of sediment in other land-encircled seas\nwhich would have been in their path, such as Hudson\u2019s Bay and the Black, Caspian, and\nBaltic Seas. Why, then, do we not find a similar thick load of sediment in these depressions?\n\nIt is not that Earth\u2019s Arctic region has not been inundated by an immense flood \u2014which\nsubject is also reserved for a future volume\u2014but this would have entailed an entirely differ-\nent mechanism.*> Under the scheme presented here, it seems more reasonable to suppose that\nthe thick sediment of the Arctic Ocean was created in situ by the constant scouring of the\ntornadic polar column.\n\nAlso, as we have seen, Earth\u2019s boreal lithospheric bulge would have risen because of\nproto-Saturn\u2019s proximity. The tidal heaping of Earth\u2019s interior magma, however, would have\nactually been greater than at the surface. The thermal energy which would have resulted from\nthe friction between this molten material and the enveloping crust would have enhanced the\nmagma\u2019s mobility. This heated plastic matter would then have broken through the surface,\ncausing a collapse of the crust. This is precisely what has been discovered in the Eurasian\nBasin of the Arctic Ocean, an area which \u201crepresents a regional collapse of the Earth\u2019s sur-\nface due to material being removed from the lower mantle.\u201d\n\nEven more recently, a swirling vortex of molten rock has been discovered 3000 kilome-\nters beneath the North Pole.47? Peter Olson and Jonathan Aurou, then from the Johns Hop-\nkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, traced a flow of almost a quarter of a degree per year\nin a region some 2400 kilometers across. As Olson stated, the flow \u201chas the structure of a gi-\nant hurricane.\u201d48\n\nThere is, incidentally, no point in claiming that these effects could have been caused by a\ndifferent set of circumstances. What is stressed here is that this is precisely what our theory\ndemands and, in that respect, the demand is met. In conjunction with the other physical evi-\ndence from the same region supplied in earlier chapters of this work (to say nothing of what\nwe intend to add in coming volumes), the accumulating signs continue to build up in our the-\nory\u2019s favor.\n\nOne more problem yet to be solved concerns the manner in which Earth came to be\nlocked within proto-Saturn\u2019s polar column. This, however, is going to take us on a final tan-\n\n41 \u201cThe Four Oceans at the Top of the World,\u201d New Scientist 21, p. 7.\n\n42 C.

                "content": "As noted earlier, free wandering objects out in space are now being regularly discovered.\nThe problem that is now facing astrophysicists is to determine whether most of these are\nplanets or brown dwarf stars. As we have already seen, red and brown dwarfs are believed to\n\u201coccupy the middle ground between planets and stars.\u201d4? But the demarcation between stars,\ndwarf stars, and planets seems forever to be changing. To make matters worse, along the way\na new class of free-floating objects were discovered that were \u201clighter than the lightest brown\ndwarf and heavier than the heaviest planets.\u201d While less massive than brown dwarfs, some\nastronomers have questioned the use of the word \u201cplanets\u201d to describe them. Other problems\nhave been listed besides. their massiveness. Thus, to give one lame example, it bas. been cal-\nculated that the objects lurking in the globular cluster known as M22 \u201cmake up as much as\n10 percent of the cluster\u2019s mass\u2014too numerous to be wandering \u2018orphaned\u2019 planets.\u201d5! As if\nquantity has any bearing in the classifying of astronomical bodies.\n\nAlan Boss settled on the term \u201csub-brown dwarfs\u201d as a designation for these free-floaters.\nBut, as Glen Schneider opined: \u201cGive a billion years of cooling and evolution, and these ob-\njects may be indistinguishable from planets.\u201d52 This is primarily because it is believed that\nthese objects are still contracting, \u201ccollapsing because of their own gravity.\u201d As Maria Za-\npatero-Osorio stated: \u201cWith time, they will look like Jupiter and Saturn.\u201d And did not Carl\nSagan claim that, at least in the infrared part of its spectrum, \u201cit might even be correct to con-\nsider Jupiter a star\u201d?54 Did not Mark Marley more recently note that: \u201cIf you line a mug shot\nof Jupiter up with these guys, it {i.e., Jupiter] is just a very low-mass brown dwarf.\u201d?55 And if\nJupiter, why not then Saturn? All of which eliminates the objection concerning whether such\na brown dwarf star\u2014or should we say sub-brown dwarf star?\u2014could ever turn into the\nplanet Saturn as proposed in the present work. But what of the stated billion years said to be\nrequired for such a transformation?\n\nUnanimity among astrophysicists seems to be as rare as that among politicians. Thus,\nquite recently, when Goran Sandell discovered what he believes to be a \u201cmonster of a proto-\nstar\u201d in the Cepheus constellation, near the emission nebula known as NGC 7538, he claimed\nthat it, and others like it, could develop into a high-mass star \u201cin an astronomical blink of an\neye\u2014only about 10,000 years.\u201d\n\nBack in 1977, astronomers focused on a disk-shaped object in the constellation Cygnus\nwhich was identified as an evolving star. Not only that, it was said that it \u201ccould well be a\nsun in the process of forming its own planets.\u201d Although the object, dubbed MWC\n349, had been known since the 1930s, it was only now that they \u201crealized how unusual it\n\n49K.

As stated in the periodical in question:\n\n\u201cSuch a process can sometimes take millions of years. But scientists will not have to\nwait that long to see how MWC 349\u2019s birth turns out. At the rate at which the disc is\ndisappearing, it will be gone in a mere 100 years.\"\n\nAnother star, FG Sagittae, has been said to be evolving so rapidly, it can actually be seen\nchanging color as it moves from one theoretical phase to another. This star has already\nchanged from blue to yellow over a mere 40 years.\n\nIn view of these cases, it does not seem reasonable to assume that a body so much less\nmassive would take a billion years to form. Coincidentally or not, 10,000 years is precisely\nthe amount of time Sam Flamsteed claimed it would take a brown dwarf star to turn into a\nJupiter sized planet.\n\nAdditionally, it is believed by some that brown dwarf stars do not shine like stars, even\nthough they generate enough heat to be detected by infrared-sensing instruments. Stuart\nGoldman, on the other hand, seems to disagree when he speaks of \u201cthe visible [although\nfeeble] light from such stellar embers.\u201d And, according to the editors of Astronomy, thirty\nnewly discovered brown dwarf stars in Rho Ophiuchi are considered to be young enough to\nallow them \u201cto glow slightly brighter than their older relatives.\u201d\u00ae This is precisely what we\nhave been proposing for the brown dwarf star that was proto-Saturn in the past pages of this\nvolume.\n\nIn the interim, models based on the known characteristics of these dwarfs have been cre-\nated in order to ascertain what these sub-stellar bodies actually look like. According to what\nAdam Burrows and his colleagues at the University of Arizona have called a \u201cfirst stab,\u201d\nbased on the so-far limited data available, the conclusion has been reached that brown dwarfs\ncan radiate in tints progressing \u201cfrom red to purple to magenta.\u201d If this turns out to be so,\nfurther conforming to our postulate regarding proto-Saturn\u2019s dull red hue, it would also coin-\ncide with Thornhill\u2019s claim that, besides its infrared emission, proto-Saturn would have radi-\nated in ultra-violet light.\u201d\n\nSome brown dwarfs, it has been theorized, might even be cloudy.
