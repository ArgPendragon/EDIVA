COORDINATOR ROUND 03 LOG: 
## Situation Overview
[Coordinator]: No new material has been made available since the last review, and the reference data remains classified as `null`. The absence of any tangible story elements, characters, or narrative structure continues to necessitate a focus on foundational planning. Priorities and agent tasks should remain geared towards creating a strong framework and mechanisms for evaluating content as it becomes available. Clear world-building, narrative progression, and enhancing creative uniqueness remain paramount.

## Priorities
1. **Finalize a World-Building Framework** – The universe’s rules, themes, and mechanics must be established to offer consistent creative direction, especially in the absence of actual narrative material.
2. **Develop a Story Evaluation Checklist for Coherence and Tension** – A structured list of checkpoints is needed to assess the plot and emotional rhythm effectively when the content becomes available.
3. **Generate Concept Prototypes for Distinctive Plot Hooks** – Creating speculative story elements or illustrative scenarios will ensure "Electric Diva" has a strong basis for originality and creative identity.

## Assigned Tasks
- **Coherence Analyst**: Expand the proposed framework for logical consistency into a detailed checklist covering narrative structure, character actions, world rules, and foreshadowing for anticipated plot elements.  
- **Tension Critic**: Draft a pacing and emotional arc evaluation checklist. This should include criteria for key moments (introductions, climaxes, resolutions) to ensure engagement and tension balance.
- **Electric Universe Expert**: Begin drafting speculative technology concepts, societal structures, or universal mechanics to define the sci-fi framework of the Electric Diva universe.
- **Creative Expert**: Develop 2-3 narrative prototypes or thematic hooks that balance familiarity with originality. These may take the form of speculative openings, central conflicts, or character backstories to shape the creative direction.

**Next Steps:** Once framework and checklist proposals are completed, agent feedback should be reviewed, and further refinement will ensure readiness for content evaluation. Subsequent priorities will be revised to integrate emerging needs or new material. This iteration will continue refining the groundwork.
