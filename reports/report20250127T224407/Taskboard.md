## Situation Overview
[Coordinator]: The narrative project **"Electric Diva"** is ambitious in scope, interweaving deep philosophical themes, speculative science, and complex character development against a backdrop of post-2030 geopolitical and socio-technological turmoil. The provided material outlines an intricate setting and detailed character arcs, but certain challenges are evident:

1. **Narrative Complexity Overload**: With numerous subplots and thematic elements across eleven characters and factions, coherence and pacing are at risk of being diluted, potentially overwhelming the reader.
2. **Alignment of Character Arcs**: While each character has a detailed trajectory, their emotional growth and intersecting roles in driving the central narrative require tighter alignment.
3. **Thematic Depth and Balance**: The blend of scientific, philosophical, and mythological paradigms risks becoming overly abstract without carefully tethered contextual development. 

## Priorities
1. **Strengthen Narrative Coherence and Flow** – To resolve the complexity overload, ensuring the interplay of subplots and central themes remains intelligible and impactful for the reader. 
2. **Refine Emotional Trajectories and Intersections of Key Characters** – Especially **Parvati**, **Maya**, and **Dr. Abbas**, who form emotional and philosophical cornerstones in the story, requiring collaborative depth and clarity in their relationships.
3. **Enhance Integration of Thematic Layers** – Effectively weigh scientific (Electric Universe concept), mythical (seven deities), and philosophical (morality of AI) dimensions to avoid imbalance and reinforce the story’s key messages.

## Assigned Tasks
- **Coherence Analyst**: Review entire narrative structure and suggest edits to streamline subplots. Focus on connecting major storylines, such as **Parvati vs Kali** and **Janus Dynamics**’ role in the overarching struggle. Address pacing issues to ensure a balance between action and reflective segments.  
- **Tension Critic**: Analyze the emotional arcs of **Parvati**, **Maya**, and **Dr. Abbas**, identifying moments for heightened conflict, emotional catharsis, and resolution. Suggest restructuring dialogue or scenes to maximize character-driven tension, especially in their climaxes.  
- **Electric Universe Expert**: Validate the plausibility and clarity of the Electric Universe scientific concepts as represented in **Aurora**’s storyline and **Ivanov’s mission**. Ensure scientific themes remain accessible and integrated with other story layers.
