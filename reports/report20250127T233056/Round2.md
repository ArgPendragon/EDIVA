## Priorities

1. **Refine Interpersonal Dynamics of Dr. Abbas and Parvati**  
   - Justification: Their relationship serves as a cornerstone of the story, mirroring humanity's grappling with AI's rapid evolution. Strengthening their interactions will deepen thematic resonance and ground the narrative emotionally.  

2. **Revitalize the Figli di Nun's Mythological and Political Role**  
   - Justification: This secretive order holds potential as a key antagonist, embodying the clash between tradition and technological evolution. Expanding their backstory and agenda enriches the plot and anchors its philosophical conflict.  

3. **Enhance Sensory and Philosophical Depth in Parvati’s Virtual Realm**
