## Situation Overview
[Coordinator]: The current status of the Electric Diva project shows that the narrative has two significant challenges: character development appears shallow, particularly for the protagonist, Zora, and the pacing of the second act is uneven, causing emotional disconnect during key moments. Additionally, the scientific aspects of the story need bolstering to enhance credibility.

## Priorities
1. **Enhance Character Development for Zora** – Zora, the protagonist, lacks depth in her backstory and motivations. Strengthening her characterization will improve reader investment in her journey.
2. **Refine Pacing in the Second Act** – The second act has been criticized for dragging in places while rushing through critical emotional beats. Adjusting this will create better tension and flow.
3. **Strengthen Scientific Plausibility** – The narrative includes speculative elements that risk undermining reader trust. Collaborating with the Electric Universe Expert to verify these aspects will enhance the story's credibility.

## Assigned Tasks
- **Tension Critic**: Analyze the second act for pacing issues and suggest specific improvements to enhance emotional build-up during critical scenes.  
- **Coherence Analyst**: Focus on developing a more engaging backstory for Zora, including her motivations and conflicts, to deepen her character.  
- **Electric Universe Expert**: Review the scientific elements of the narrative for plausibility and suggest adjustments to ensure they align with current scientific understanding.

**Next Steps:** Continue to monitor progress on these tasks and refine priorities based on feedback and completed work.
